  In my opinion, itÅfs important for students to have a part-time job. But I argue that the job must be a proper part-time job. There are many advantages for a student to have a proper part-time job. For instance, a proper part-time job can help students to realize that no success comes from noting. It also enables students to be independent and build up their self-confidence. In addition, a proper part-time can make the students out of the ivory tower and give them lots of opportunities to know more of themselves and the society. In the same time, students can realize their personal value in society by having a proper part-time job.     Of course, as we all known, everything has two sides. If we do not know the balance between part-time and learning, something bad will occur to us. In other words, an improper part-time job will bring many disadvantages to us. For example, an improper part-time job must occupy studentsÅf time and make them just pay their attention on money but not what they should to learn.   In a word, a part-time job is important for the students, but the students must keep a good balance between part-time and their learning.   
With the development of the living conditions and qualities, quite more and more students have the opportunity to go to college .Parents and the public are concerned with college studentsÅf development .A great many people start to pay more attention on part-time job. Some people hold the view that part-time jobs will affect studentsÅf study in college. In my opinion, a part-time job can help a lot. First of all, knowledge should be put into proactive. Through a part-time job, we can better understand what we have learned in college. Also, we can gain much more than what we have learned from books. Moreover a part-time job is a bridge which connects the college period and the career period after graduation. Some students will feel to have no direction when they graduate of they have never had part-time jobs in college. Since fierce competition is waiting for them, they have little time to adjust to the new environment. IT is not easy for then to learn how companies and working. Yet,Å@if they once had part-time jobs. They will better get involved in the jobs they do. Last but not least, a part-time job can help one build up social relationship and will make one feel more confident.  The modern society needs talents that develop in all directions.  What we learn from textbooks is far less than enough. A part-time job will make up our disadvantages effectively.    
Recently, I found some people are discussing warmly on weather it is important for college student to have a part-time job. Someone think it is a waste of time for student who should spend much of in studying while some believe that it is a good chance for student to get the knowledge on how to earn money and how to live in the society which they have to learn when they leave school.   To my point of view, it is important for college student to have a part-time job. First of all, it is a good chance for student raise their ability of living in the society. As we all know, during the recent years, it is hard for some student who just left school to find a good job since the company do not admit they ability by a piece of paper since the education system is not trustful. At this time, if they show something they got in the part-time job, it would be very useful for them. Meanwhile, as a college student myself, I find that we have a lot of spare time after finishing the courses required, the part-time job in spare time can enlarge our abilities of communication, teamwork spirit and so on.   However, we should have a clear mind on the priority, as a student, the first mission is learning, part-time job can help us a lot, but if you failed a lot, you will still face many problems,. Beyond this, pay more attention with the contract when you what to sign in a part-time job. 
Different people hold different views on part-time jobs for college students. Although more and more people focus their attention on part-time jobs, I donÅft think we should do part-time jobs in college. We fell happy and proud that we go to the colleges we have long been dreaming for after great efforts. However we are faced with more challenges. The subjects we study are not easy to grasp. We also need to develop social relationships. Still, we need to take part in many competitions. Moreover, there are quite a lot of books lying in the library we need to go though. It is really a great opportunity for us to develop ourselves in all aspects. We are supplied with so many chances that we have no time to do part-time jobs. It would be better that we go out when we graduate. In conclusion, we should cherish the golden time in college for self-learning and self-developing. What the most important is that we would better keep busy every minute to make each day count in order to fulfill our dream and contribute to our society better. So do not do things that distract our attention from studying. Make better use of every day to make ourselves more and more independent powerful. 
As is known to us all, college is a place where people look for further education, exchange their academic ideas and finally both enrich their selves for their future career in society and propel the development of all endeavors of society. However, college is not equal to society. College students need opportunities to get in touch with those things beyond campus and accumulate enough practical experiences for their future careers. It is precisely the part-time job that gives such opportunities to college students. Serving in restaurants, working as an intern secretary for a company, or being a salesman selling commodities on short-term sale etc., no matter what part-time job a college student chooses to participate in, she will learn practical skills to adjust to society which academic-centered college cannot teach her. Besides, it should be taken into consideration that part-time jobs do offer a certain amount of money to college students, making some financial income for college studentsÅf daily life or even helping them to afford their college study. One of my high school classmates went to a college in Singapore for further education after his graduation, in the first year, his family offered his nearly $15,000 for study and living expense. Now he is in his senior year, with his part-time job income of nearly $250 per month on average, he will save at least $2,000 for his family when he get his bachelor degree. During the two yearsÅf part-time job, he not only gained money, but also learn things about making contract with a company, getting along with coworker, how a restaurant is arranged and run, etc. Hence, it is important to college students to have a part-time job. 
It is an interesting topic for us to discuss, and it is necessary for us to consider if we should do something in our spare time.  As a university student, I think it is important to have a part-time job. I have three reasons below. First of all, from primary school to now, it is our parents who are supporting us to study. We have not spent one coin, which is earned by ourselves. We are no longer children; we are adult now.  So we have the responsibility to support ourselves. To have a part-time job is a good choice.  Secondly, the life at college is not so busy that we donÅft have any spare time. As a matter of fact, we have leisure to do many things we like. You may spend time on computer games, or doing some reading, or learning some software or something else. Certainly, you can find a part-time job to make life full. At last, a part-time job is a job, we could gain experience in the process. We can learn how to work with others, how to adjust to different environment, how to do a plan for ourselves to have a brilliant future. It must be useful in the future life. In conclusion, I think it is important and helpful to have a part-time job. 
Is it a good thing for college students to work part-time jobs? I think there are many advantages for college students to have part-time jobs. Many teachers complain that there are fewer and fewer students who pay attention to their study because of part-time jobs. But in my opinion, students can choose to take up a part-time job according to their own situation. As we know, college students have fewer subjects and less pressure than high school. They have more time to do things they like. Having a part-time job is not a bad idea I think. Taking a part-time job has lots of advantages for college students. Firstly, part-time job offer them opportunities to apply what they have learned in school and demonstrate their abilities. Secondly, students can make some money through the part-time job, and it enables them to be more independent of their family and builds up their self-confidence. Thirdly, part-time experiences may be of great help to their future careers. Finally, part-time jobs can broaden their college lives and help them know more of themselves and society.  But the more important thing for them is to keep a good balance between part-time job and their study. On the condition, I agree with the opinion that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. 
 I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  I think the part-time job is necessary for college students to have more chance to know the situation of themselves. If a college student only at school learns the knowledge he has to learn, he will never know the difficulty they would be in when they are in society.  There is a large number of students donÅft know the hardness of earning money. They use money without self-control. The money is from their parents, college students without their work they donÅft how much have to pay to earn money. If they have a part-time job, they will know the hardness of earning money, how much have to pay to earn money.   There are also many studentsÅf families are not so rich for them to go to college in China now.  The paid for go to college is a huge burden for their families. If they can have part-time jobs to earn money in the spare time of their studies, it will let their parents to feel more releasable. Also it can make many students to have more extra money to buy what they like.   For those reasons, I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. 
 I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Not for the payment, but the experience which we get from the work.   As a college student, though we learn a lot in class and take part in kinds of activities, the knowledge for working is far from enough. We even donÅft know copy the documents or make a schedule for others. Someone even donÅft have a consciousness of time ? no matter how the meeting is important, they are always late.    We hope to train ourselves, and of course, the companies also want the college students to have more ability. So if one has an experience just like a part-time job while studying, he/she will get a dominant position in the job-searching.   Somebody maybe say ÅgOK! We will train ourselves in the Student Union. ItÅfs a good place for learning and working.Åh I donÅft think so. Although we can learn a lot in the Student Union, for example, to write a program for the sports-meeting, the Student Union is not a company or the society. You are working, but with your classmates and in the campus.   These are the reasons why I believe that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. 
When we come to the college, almost every new student will be into the situation. Should our students to have a part-time job? In my opinion, itÅfs necessary to have a part-time job. Most of the students havenÅft ever leave home before entered the college. It seems that we are always in the protection of our parents. Therefore, we need to see and know the world by our own eyes. Having a part-time job can make us to attach the real world and society. It likes my father said, life is like a school. To be a student, we should not only learn knowledge form the text books but also from the life. Life is always your best teacher. WhatÅfs more, from the part-time job we also learn that itÅfs not so easy to earn money as we think. Mostly, whatÅfs we paid would be more than we earn. And if you want to be going further than others, you should arm yourselves better than others. That means you should know more and learn more. Within the job we increase our experiences as well. For example, what should we do when facing the emergency? How to do a work better? And I believe that it will be a warmly memory when we look back whenever it is. 
ItÅfs more and more popular for college students to take a part-time job nowadays. Personally I think it is important to do so.    First of all, taking a part-time job teaches us to be thrifty. As we can see, most of the college students tend to luxurious now. They buy clothes with famous brand which are quite expensive. I admit expensive clothes usually have good quality, but too expensive with famous brand ic unnecessary. While most of them seek for the famous brand rather than good quality . So itÅfs important to learn to be thrifty for us. Secondly, taking a part-time job can give us some good experience which will help us to get used to society. Though we have many activities in college, thatÅfs different from society after all . I took a part-time job as a waitress in a restaurant last term. I must be patient and considerate to all kinds of people. I also need to make the tables clean after they had meals. I learned hoe to hold dishes when I served them to the customs and many things else. I stopped the job because itÅfs a little tired and I was busy afterwards. But itÅfs a good experience. It taught me to be tolerant when getting along with people. Another thing is that taking a part-time job helps us earn some money. It can lighten the burden of our family, especially for the poor ones.       There are also many other advantages of part-time job, such as broadening our knowledge, strengthening our body and so on. So I think itÅfs important for college students to take a part-time job.  
In my opinion, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. If the college student can take the full use of the part time job, it can not only bring the salary but also can provide the chance of prove our social experience. College students are different from the high school or junior students. The aim we study in the college is to have a job, but not for enter the university as before. Social life has its own rule which is very different from the school, it is more complicate, more danger. So if we have no experience we will fell very puzzling when we graduated from university. Some people disagree with the idea who said that college students are easy to be tricked. But I think it is much better than be tricked when you graduated. On the other hand, be tricked is also an important course we have to learn before we enter the social, which is canÅft be learned from the courses we take in the school, but only can learn from the practice. Of course, all we talked is based on that your part time will not influence your normal studying. If you spend most time on part time job which make you canÅft educated, than except the money ,you can get nothing from the part time job and it just lost itÅfs real meaning. Balance is important for everything. 
As far as I am concerned, it is important for student to have a part-time job. My points are listed as follows. Firstly ,students in the school take classes in the campus everyday, so that they concentrate too much on the books in front of them ,leading to a fact that they do not know much about the society, which is by all means not good for them esp when they step into society .Having a part-time job help them to learn to work in a earlier time, to get along with people who have been working for some period of time and so on, all of which give them a closer view to society ,which is certainly a kind of good experience for them . Secondly, doing a part-time job make students have different points of views as they should deal with people from all walks of life .This can also gives them different respects to value things . Thirdly, they know better how to earn money and have a deeper understanding of how their parents brought them up, which also let them treasure the present life. So, it is important for student to have a part-time job.  
I donÅft think part-time job is important in college life.  First of all, as being a college student, we still have lots to learn and we have no idea what we are capable of. Because of this, we usually choose very simple and meaningless part-time jobs like waiters and cleansers. Truly we can earn some small pocket money through these jobs, but in the same time, the precious time that we lost just equals the value. In order to spare the time, I prefer to make a good use of the library which is definitely great treasure for us and we very likely wonÅft be able to have access to the large amount of knowledge any more. So why donÅft we treasure the time and the utilities now, so that we can arm ourselves with broad sight and knowledge.  About the working experience or the society experience, I think these are ought to be realized after graduation for we have plenty of time to deal with the society, like 5 decades or even more. IÅfm sure that at that moment, we must be very tired of work and always like to looking back to our campus life which should be pure, full of activities and enjoyment, maybe piles of books we have read which brings us wisdom, or maybe an unforgettable girlfriend or boyfriend. Whatever it is, it will never be the job.  Compared with the work time, school time is so short, I hope I can enjoy my school life to the largest extent and leave no regret! 
Is it important for college students to have a part-time job? ItÅfs becoming a controversial question recently as more and more college students do part-time job in their spare time.   Those people, who hold that having a part-time job is essential for college students, emphasize that through part-time jobs, students can learn professional knowledge better. For example, the student who is major in computer takes a part-time job in a computer company, he can learn the knowledge that doesnÅft exist in books and at the same time he can realize thereÅfs still a lot to learn so that he works harder and harder. WhatÅfs more, the part-time job provides them with experiences that canÅft be taught in a lecture hall. They think that the knowledge learn from schools is insufficient. So it is helpful to attend this kind of social life to get social knowledge. It seems that part-time jobs act as warm-up exercises for students to take full-time jobs after they graduate, and help them prepare for their future careers. The students who have the experiences in part-time jobs will be more competitive when they find job. Last but not least, the part-time job can offer the students whose families have financial problems enough money so that they can study until graduating from college.  Others, on the contrary, will of course opposite and, they believe that the most important thing for student is study. They argue that college students are too young to face up with the complex society and itÅfs also a waste of time. According to me, the benefits will certainly outdo the drawbacks. However, it depends on you .If you can deal the relationship between working and learning well, IÅfm sure that you can succeed in the end. 
 From my point of view, I partly agree with the point that college student should have a part?time job.   College is a very important step before enter the society. University and the society is very similar, you must learn some practical life skills in the university. But the fact is that you can`t learn such skills in the textbooks in the university.   I think in the university, we have more time to do something we really want to do, so why not try to seek for the chance, and do a part?time job? That will really benefit to us.   Though a part?time job is not a official wok, it still quite difficult for those unexperienced. You will learn how to treat people, how to deal with the problems, also some troubles we have never met before. For us, it means enter the society ahead of time. It is beneficial.   But everything has two sides, do a part?time job also has its disadvantage, if you can`t balance the relation between study and work, it will influence your studyÅBAfter all, I think the advantages are bigger than the disadvantages. So the college students should have a part?time job. 
Now many college students have part-time job .I think it is important for us because we can not only learn at school . We must go out of school to know other things that we can not learn from school . Part-time job is the good way to do this .From part-time job we can learn the way   to communicate with others ,not just with classmates . From part-time job we can know many people who maybe can help ourselves at other way .From part-time job we also can learn the difficult that happens in the future . Although part-time job maybe can costs our study time , it is worth to do this ,I think . What is more , Part-time job also can help the student whose family have not much money to support a student to go to college . Doing a part-time job can make some money to support the study . I did a part-time job last term and it helped me much, not for the money but the experience that can help me all the time between my college time so I think a part-time job is important for college students . All above is my opinion . That is all . 
Should students do a part-time job or not differs from different students in different countries. Of course ,doing a part-time job is good for students to build more abilities not only about the knowledge in the textbook. But for me, I donÅft think is good to do the part-time jobs. I have got a lot to do within my lessons, I really have no more time to spend on other jobs, even though I know it clearly that doing such a job is good to me. If I spend my time that should be spent doing my lessons, I think the result would be that neither I learn what I should learn in the textbook, and neither will I gin a ability that should be built by doing the part-time job, because I canÅft do the two things with my full heart.]   So if you have a lot of free time I suggest you to do a part-time job, selecting a job that fit to you is very important, in my opinion the best is the ones have confections with your subject in school. If you really have got a lot of works to deal with, itÅfs better to spend all your efforts in your own studying, not even thinking about searching a part-time job, for that you can learn most things in the shortest time in school,  at least I think so. 
Yes, I think so. Since we are now college students, it means not only studying hard, but also ÅgworkingÅh hard. After graduating from the college, we are to step into the society. If we donÅft have any experience about how to work well, how can we live on? Having a part-time job just means getting more experience about the job and the society. At the same time, we can make money for our everyday life, and save money from our parents. That will make our parents happy.  As is known for all, having a part-time job requires us to balance study and part-time job well. That can practice our management skill of time. Saving more time means living longer. If we can manage our time well, we can have a much more efficient life.  Moreover, we can practice our communication skill. Nowadays, the level of communication skill leads to the level of your success. If we can communicate with others well, we can make many friends, and they can help us when needed. With the help from our friends, we can succeed more easily than on our own.  So, I agree with college students having a part-time job. 
 When I was a high school student, I was always dreaming about my colorful college life. In my eyes, college students should make the best use of the time to experience different things. Of course, I cannot miss part-time job.  I do believe that we can benefit from doing a part-time job and my opinion is based on the following reasons.  Firstly, it is said that the campuses are much purer than the society and we college students lack society experience. According to this fact, the most important point of part-time job is gaining experience so that we can get ourselves prepared for the jobs in the future.      Besides, we learn to how to deal with others through doing part-time jobs. We will be aware of customsÅf need and learn to use what we have learnt to fulfillment their requirement.  The last but not the most least is that we can earn some pocket money to buy something we are longing for, to give our parents a surprise that we are no longer children. WhatÅfs more, as earning money is no easy, we will realize the importance of money and learn to use money more correctly. Do a part-time job to larger our vision, to improve ourselves, to make our college life more colorful. 
It is important for college students to have a part-time job I do agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Lack of money may be the most import reason for us college students to search for a part-time job as we knew. For some students it is the part-time job that provides them with the fundamental cost of living. And it will make it possible to start a life without parentsÅf financial aid although we should have been self-reliable in as an adult. It is true that thinking of the hardship we will consider fully before we spend the money made by ourselves. Moreover, as college students, aside from academic knowledge, we should gain more experience through those part-time job. I had a part-time job of teaching a high school student math one year ago. At weekends, I should wake up early to take the first bus while my roommates were enjoying the beautiful dreams. But being paid for 30 RMB per hour, I did obtain a sense of achievements through this part-time job. I think what we gain through part-time jobs is not only the money but also the particular experience after hard working. I think the college life will lack color if we live out four years in college without doing a part-time job.  
 This is a discussion about if it is right for college students to have a part-time job. Some students think that it is important for us have the chance to have a part-time job to broaden our view. However, there is still some students think that it is no need for us using time and energy to have a part-time job.  In my opinion, I think that it is very important for us college students to have a part-time job. Firstly, having a part-time job can help us make good use of our time. Because most of us use our time on playing computer games or playing with friends after class. Secondly ,having a part-time job can give us more experience. It will make us college students more confident and mature for future . Besides, having a part-time also can make some money, can't it ? We can use the money we make buy some things we need. For example , the professional books or tools . What's more, we can live easier with the money.  In one word, I agree with the students who think that it is important for college students to have a part-time . And it is the time for us to take a action!   
I thinkÅCas a university student ÅCif we have the chanceÅCwe should take a part-time jobÅBThe reasons are as followsÅB Firstly ÅCwe can earn some money so that parents` burden can be reduced ÅBThough it is not too much ÅCour parents can know that we understand their pressure and that we are trying our best to do all that we can ÅBour parents will feel happy to see thisÅB SecondlyÅCif we work as a teacher in your part-time job ÅCwe can review what we have learnedÅBOur students and we ourselves can promote at the same time ÅCwhich we may be not realize until we have made progress obviouslyÅB ThirdlyÅCwe can get the ability to communicate with people in societyÅCwhich is very important when we work in companies in future ÅBsince we are studentsÅCwe get along only with students every dayÅBAs a result ÅCwhen many graduates enter the society ÅCthey cannot adjust to the difficulties and challenges at the beginning ÅCbut if we have taken part-time jobs ÅCmaybe it can be avoidedÅB HoweverÅCmany students hold the opinion that taking a part-time job may waste our time ÅCAs a studentsÅCwhat is the most important is studyingÅCwe can earn money after we have graduatedÅBIn my opinionÅCtaking a part-time job does not mean that we are wasting our studying time ÅBBecause it depends on the way you arrange your time ÅBAs a college student ÅCwe should have the ability to make our time to be full usedÅB CertainlyÅCeveryone has their own opinion on the topicÅCjust do what you think is right. 
Many people think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job, because the students can not only earn money by themselves but also can learn something which they couldnÅft learn in the school. At the same time some other people insist that students should stay in the school to study the knowledge.  In my opinion, I agree that the students in college should have a part-time job. Because there is more knowledge which can not be learned from the textbooks. If a student wants to fail less, then what he needs is not only the knowledge which he learns from schools. Maybe study the knowledge from the books well is important, but the knowledge which can be learned from the society is necessary. Some people may think that it is a waste to have a part-time job for the college students. However, if a student only knows the knowledge that he learns from the books, he may lost more in the future. 
As far as a qualified modern college student is concerned, I approve of the opinion that It is important for college students to have a part time job. From my point of view, it can not only relief our parentsÅf burden but also enable us to make good preparation for our social life in the future. It is well known that the campus is called Ågivory towerÅh, and it is also very obvious that students should pay most of their attention on their professional knowledge. But on the other hand, college students in modern time should also have a good knowledge of the world outside. And a part-time job is just a good chance to contact the society and learn more practical things that canÅft be learned at school. For example, as for me, I am doing a part time job as a private teacher. I think it can offer me some money to do whatever I want without ask my mother. And whatÅfs more important is that through the part-time job, I have learned how to balance my study and other things batter. I also learned how to get well with different kinds of people. I also did other kinds of part-time before.        I learned much from my experience and these are all prepare for my future work.  There is no doubt that a part-time job can offer us the chance to know the world outside better which may awaken in us a high sense of duty and help us make greater achievement in the future. Therefore, I think it is important for college students to have a part time job. 
  As a matter of fact, IÅfm just doing a part time job as a fraulein now at weekends. I also get some money from it and feel very happy, because it is the first money I got by myself. As a fraulein, I must face with many kinds of people. I think it is the thing that is impossible to avoid.   But in China, there are very little part time jobs for our students. I know, in Japan, university students can do part time jobs not only as a fraulein but also as a waiter, a librarian, even a cook and so on. I think it is the reason why the students in Japan are morn self-support than our Chinese students. In China, many students donÅft want to do part time jobs because they think it can make them lose countenance. But I donÅft think so. I think do part time jobs can make our students step into the society, then we will know the importance of study. Knowledge can make us richer than only do jobs with our hands.   So I think do part time jobs are very necessary for our university students. I also want to do many kinds of part time jobs to make myself much stronger. 
In my opinion, it is not important for college students to have a part-time job. Firstly , Chinese students are always busy with their studies. Even though they have gone to college , they still have many lessons. A part-time job will take our time that should be used for studying. We may not do our homework well. So, it begins at the wrong end.  Secondly, a part-time job will cost the physical power. If we are tired, we may fall asleep easily on class. Over fatigue are not only bad for our study, but also bad for our health. Thirdly, if we have a part-time job, we may see many new people and many different things. All these will hold our mind. Even on class, our mind may sneak away. Of course many people think that part-time jobs can make college students become independent, strengthen our communication ability. But, whenever, the good score is the precondition for a good job. So if we really want to experience a part-time job, it is better to wait until we turn to grade four, when we are not busy with studying any more. 
I agree with that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. First,college is a place not only for us to learn our major,but also a place to learn how to make a life in the future.The experance of working is very important.Because it can let us know how to deal with kinds of troubles when we step into the society. Second,to have a part job means we can earn some money.Though it is not a large income,we can know the hardness to earn money.I suppose that many of the Chinese college stuents spent too much money on unnesscery things, just because they get money only from their parents. But in my opinion,not all the part-time job are fit for us.If we choose the job which take us too mach time,it will do bad to our studies.The most important thing for our college students,as all know,is studies.So I preffer the job take me two or three times a week,and every time one or two hours. Every coin has two sides.What we should do is to find a balance between studies and part-time job. 
I think it is not very important for college students to have a part-time job. First, the most important duty of students is to learn knowledge. We go to school for knowledge, isnÅft it? If we have a part-job, maybe it will have a bad influence on our study. Because part-time job will spend some pieces of time. Second, what can we get from a part-time job? I think most people will say ,money and experience. Yeah, we can get experience, but the studentsÅf work in school also can give us that. I think the only reason of a part-time job is money. If you are quite lack of money, youÅfd better to have one. If you just want to have a try, maybe one time is enough. To most of students, a part-time job is a tool to earn money, but I think in this time, the most important thing is to improve ourselves, to get knowledge and make friends with our schoolmates, but not to make ourselves rich. However, maybe this is different in different countries.  So, I think, it is not very important for college students to have a part-time job. 
I think it is important for a college-student to support a part-time job. Maybe someone will say Ågyou must do what student should to do, as a student, the only work you need to you is to study.Åh  But I think this opinion is not completely right, why? As a college-student, we have already been adults, we have the ability to keep ourselves, although we need to study, we donÅft have so much time for part-time job , but little is forever better than nothing . We can do some simple part-time jobs, although the salary is too poor to keep our life, with this money we can reduce pressure of our parents. And the most important reason is the part-time job can make us to know the society, nowadays collage-students have few chances to know the society , when they graduate from collage and enter in the society , they will feel anxious . Part-time job can make you know how to live in the society, and let you know how to make communications with other people. these are very important for us to live in the society.    Take a little time, and get you much advantage, go to search for a part-time job. 
Nowadays, more and more students are doing part-time work. But different people hold different opinion .I think students working part time usually have a positive effect on them. For instance, it helps him to realize that no success comes from nothing. It enables him to be independent and builds up his self-confidence. WhatÅfs more, part-time jobs can get the students out of the ivory tower and give them the opportunity to get along with different kinds of people ,get useful working experiences and learn the value of labor. Besides earning some money to support themselves, they can learn a lot which cannot be learned from textbooks. As everything has two sides, the disadvantages can't be ignored. Part-time jobs cut into students' study time; some even become so occupied with making money that they canÅft focus their attention on studying. In the end, these students may fall behind or fail in their studies.        In my opinion, students can choose to take up a job according to their own situation. The most important thing is for him to keep a good balance. 
I donÅft think it is very important for our college students to have a part-time job. Part-time job, in my opinion ,is just one of the small pieces in college life, maybe it helps us to know how difficult it is to make a life in modern life, and make us work hard. but it also waste a lot of our time, which should be used in studying.  Our parents live a hard life to offer tuition fee to us, so we have the duty to do our work well. ItÅfs true that college is the place for us to enjoy our lives, we canÅft spend all our youth to study, we can take part in many activities to make new friends, and take a job. But we should never forget that study should always come first. Without good results, nothing is meaningful.  I canÅft deny all the students who take part-time jobs. The students whose family havenÅft got the ability to offer the tuition had to work to continue his study. But the students whose families have enough money for you to use should focus your attention on study. Now even you go to find a job, without technology, you can only find a low income job, which have nothing to do with what you have learned.  
In my opinion, It is important for college students to have a part-time job. For college students there is much spare timeÅBIt is unreasonable for them to use all their spare time on playing games especially computer gamesÅB It is sensible to have a part time job for college studentsÅBFor one thingÅChaving a part time job can help us know more about our societyÅBWe can learn a lot from our part time jobÅCsuch as how to communicate with others well and what we need that can help us do the work wellÅBAll of thisÅCyou can not learn when you always stay at campus and read your booksÅBFor another thingÅChaving a part time job can keep us healthyÅBWhyÅHnow studentsÅf mental health is becoming a problemÅBStudents often feel lonely if they have nothing to do expect for studyingÅBThey will become ill in mental easily if they can not manage time wellÅBHaving a part time job is a good idea because it can enrich our spare timeÅBFinally having a part time job can help us make some money so that we will not have to depend on our parents for living expense .even we can pay tuition fee by ourselves . Having a part time can make our college live more brilliant.   
I agree with the point that it is important for college students to have part-time jobs. In China, there are quite a large number of students cannot afford their tuition. For the reason of attending college and daily life, sometimes they have to find one or more part-time jobs. Of course, there are still large numbers of students have no problem with money. But I think for them, taking a job doesnÅft mean to earn money but to earn more experience. College is just like a small society. Having a part-time job at college can help us enter the society easier. And I think only when we start to make money we realize the difficulty in it. We know for our parents making money is not that easy too. We are adults now and we should act as an adult. Even though having a part-time job can benefit us a lot, we still should pay attention to it. Firstly, itÅfs important to choose a job fit for us. Say we are now at collage and we canÅft spent all day at the work. WhatÅfs more, we mustnÅft forget our study. Make sure our study is developing smoothly and then we can spent sometime at the job. I think most collage students may have the experience of taking a part-time job, maybe long or short, maybe one kind or many kinds of. I indeed appreciate my part-time job as a family-teacher. Being a student for so many years, itÅfs cool to sometimes become a teacher! 
At present, more and more university students are doing part-time jobs, they work as family tutors, waiters, salesmen and so on. Like everything else, having a part-time have both favorable and unfavorable aspects. The advantages can be listed as follows. First, through have a part-time job the students can have the chance of earning pocket money and this can reduce their parentsÅf financial burden. In addition, they can put what they have experience and get to know the society. For example, they can learn to get along with people. ThatÅfs canÅft be learnt from books.    But every coin has two sides, the disadvantages of having a part-time job are also apparent. some students think that Part-time job may take up too much time and energy, and may influence their study.   As to me, I believe the positive aspects outweigh the negative ones, because when we are college students, we have much time which can be used by ourselves, I think have a part-time job will more useful then to use this time to sleep or play computer games. Also the experience which have through the part-time job will be very useful when we enter in the society. Therefore, students can benefit from their part-time job so long as they can keep a good balance between study and work. 
There is a general debate on the campus recently over the phenomenon of college students` doing a part-time job, which also has been widely concerned by the public. Without any doubt, engaging in a part-time job will goes a long way to college students who have been educated by Chinese style education and have narrow knowledge of the society. The majority of the students believe that by taking a part-time job they can not only improve their academic studies but also gain much experience such as interpersonal skills which may put them in a favorable position in the future job markets. And in my opinion a proper part-time job would not occupy students too much time. In the other hand spending all the time on study in the room is not a wise choice. The last but not the most important, college students should have the conscious of relieving the pressure of family .Of course doing a part-time job is the best way. Everything has both positive and negative aspects, and students` doing a part-time job is of no exception. There is some students canÅft manage time well and that will cause problems of filature in concentrating on study. Another serious resistance is that most parents think the society today is too complicated for the college students to adjust to and what is more, we may be cheated. So I suggest that the government should set out a series of laws to norm the part-time job markets and to protect students rights.  From what has been discussed above, I draw a conclusion that part-job ,which seems not the most proper and reasonable nowadays ,can product many benefits to college students and our future, should be encouraged. 
In my opinion, the part-time job is beneficial to a college student. Doing part-time job, they can earn money by themselves, know more about the difficulties of making money, gain some experience and become more independent.   While there are some problems. The first problem is time. As students of Japanese department, most of us get up at six, in order to read Japanese text and then study till midnight every day, even on Saturday and Sunday. So up to now, only two students take a part-time job in our class.   Though the part-time job is beneficial, the role it plays in our campus life is not very important. I even can't feel my sister's change after she did the part-time job when she was a college student. And now she is more pleased to see that I pay more attention to the Japanese and English than doing a part-time job. If someone want to lighten the economic burden by doing part-time jobs, it needs a lot of time .Because a little work doesn't work. Maybe work hard for the scholarship is more efficient.   Do you think my view is opposite to the first one? I just want to say in the theory, the part-time job is beneficial; in the fact, it doesn't make much difference and needs time.   For myself, If I won't be so busy in the second or third year in the college, I am glad to do a part-time job, but not must to. 
When it comes to college studentsÅf part-time jobs, people will hold different opinions on it. Although some people believe it is not necessary for college students to do part-time jobs, I think it helpful for us. There are some factors supporting my point. Doing part-time job is what can improve our ability including working ability and living ability. Besides, in this way we can step on the society earlier, touch different people and experience different things, which is contributed to open and enlarge our field and vision. In addition ,we can also earn money which allows us to do what we want. However, there are also some disadvantages in it. For example , it will take a lot of time which should be spent on study. So we must deal with the part-time job and the studyÅfs relation. WhatÅfs worse, we also may be taken in by some evildoers. So it is necessary for us to improve our alert. If We can do as this, we will gain many meaningful things from it Taking into account all these features, I believe deep that it is important for us colleges to do part-time job.  
I donÅft agree with the statement that itÅfs important for a college student to have a part-time job. It is not a matter of money, but a matter of ability. Being an 18 or 19-year-old student, the knowledge we have gained from their study already enables us to take in some kinds of work, such as being a private teacher, a waiter and so on. What we are lack of is the opportunities to develop or practice our potential. Only by having a try, can we really get more experiences that will assess us in the future job. , And a part-time job offers us such a valuable stage.  Since we have been a college student, study should not fill our life as usual, we have so much spare time that we should make full use of them to do some meaningful things, and a part-work is a good choice.   By making money by ourselves, will we value our parentsÅf endeavor more, and be confident and independent more, no matter we are in a rich family or poor. Also, though the social practice, what we get is not only money, but another fresh attitude towards the society and work, which we can never learn from any book. ThereÅfs no doubt that we will encounter a lot of difficulties in the part-time job, for example, how to balance the time between study and work, at the beginning maybe itÅfs a problem, but as time goes on, you can be a master of time, you will be more and more efficient, which is really important in our high-speed developing society. All in all, a part-time job is really of great importance. 
In my eyes, it is not important for collage students to have a part-time job.    First, we donÅft short of money. No matter wealth or poor, our parents are able to support us to go to university .Also; it is their responsibility to do this. So at this point, we have no reason to make money by ourselves. Having a part-time job, some students only want to buy present for their girlfriends or boyfriends, or just in order to have a new PSP.    Second, as we know, we are students, we have the severe competition and are admitted to the university which we like, and our aims are to get a good further education. It is also our relatives want us to do. But we waste our time on the part-time job, I think is not worthy. Though a little progress we will make, we are unable to take a big jump in the future. Putting into a lot of energy, the time we used to study is very short.    Last but not the least important is that we cannot make sure whether it is safe for a part-time job. A lot of newspapers have reported such news as like students are killed because of the part-time job.  
      I think the first professional is knowledge, social jobs and skills are the second point.      We are STUDENTS, not workers or so on. To have a good job, first of all, we should have good structure of the knowledge.       Students must have the basic skills of learning, so that we can plan our own future for our lives better .To take full advantage of opportunity, college students should study hard instead of working. Only to learn can we meet the greater challenges.       A famous philosopher once said: Giving fishing skills to someone is far more better than giving fish to him. Working in college can just earn money, but if you study well, you can earn more and more.     That is my opinion of this subject. 
There are still so many people discussing about this topic whether it is important for a collage student to find a part-job.     Because in some peopleÅfs opinion, the students who have find a fit job can alleviate the financial burden on the family. But the others think it is a waste of time to do so, because studentsÅf most important duty is study. They should care there expertise first. My view is that it free for the collage students whether they should do so. It depends on studentsÅf self-condition. At first time limit is a big problem in front of the part-job. Because some studentsÅf courses need a lot of time to study, such as languages. It is not reality for them to find a part-job. Then some of the studentsÅfs family conditions are not good enough to supply their live. So it is necessary for them to find a job so that they can live better and mitigate their parentÅfs pressure. The last point, there are still so many students who both have time and a good live condition and they also  want to improve themselves .so they could do a part-job to promote their ability and social experience.   Some people say that the times of university is the best in a personÅfs whole life. So we should plan well and enjoy the youth with the whole heart. 
I donÅft think so.To find a part-time job maybe helpful, howere, honestly speaking it is not helpful to many college students . First of all,taking part-time jobs may take much of our time which should have been used in study.To most of we students the most important thing is getting as much knowledge as possible before graduating .What an employer wants is the knowledge you have not how much you have earned in your part-time job. Second,in grade 4,colleges will provide us opportunities to take practice.We can learn experienses, money and all we need to prepare at that time.At that time we will be better prepared than before. Third,since we live in such a country that have a huge number of people,the amount of the work that is able to do is limited.If we all want to get a part-time job then how many chances will leave those who really need a job to survive. What can those people do? Then what will our country be like? In conclusion,I think it unnecessary for a college students to find a part-time job.It is not helpful for himself and also not good to other people, further more not good to the society. It is better to do the right thing at the right time. 
It is important for college students to have a part-time job    Being college students means we are not children any more and we already have the ability to support ourselves. However,  infact , almost everyone of us students in China  depends on our parents which leads to a phenomenon that parents work hard and children play hard.   In my opinion, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. not only can we enjoy the pleasure of earning money, but we can get to know the hardship of life so that we can hard work and appreciate it. Beside, having a part-job can provide us a chance to acquaint ourselves with society.   Nevertheless, there are also many persons standing for the idea that a part-time job is a waste of time because studying is the important  job for a student. For this ,I have to say they are wrong .Taking a job is not a waste of time ,on the contrary ,it can teach us how to use time in a proper way.   We may meet a lot of problem while doing the job .That is not the problem. For all pain helps to make us rise, however much we may hate it at the time What is more, we are young and we have the courage to conquer them. The job may bring us more pains than happiness, but it is really a treasure that will bring us more opportunities in the future. We have to pay the price if we want to win.   In a word, we can benefit a lot from a part-time job. Please remember the sentence: Knowledge comes from experience alone. 
I agree with the statement that itÅfs important for college students to have a part-time job.  First of all, in modern society, college students are facing bigger and bigger pressure on job hurting. Almost all the companies are tending to employ staffs with working experiences even for the new graduates. In order to find a job, college students need working experiences. During college, students are old enough to be hired; college study is not as busy as lower level education, too. This is really a good time to start working.  Meanwhile, college students get paid by part-time jobs; this will also lighten the financial pressure from the parents.  With the income students can spend more money on there interests, which may have positive effects to their lives.  At last, there must be a lot of differs between campus life and society. By part-time jobs, students will learn how to communicate with different people, how to face failure and challenges, which can never be taught in campuses. Students with part-time jobs will know the society earlier and better. This will make them brave, responsible and grown-up.  So I think itÅfs very important for college students to have a part-time job. And I hope the society and companies will provide more part-time positions. 
When asked about it id important for college students to have a part-time job.Å@Some people disagree this view. They think a part-time job waste many time for students to study at school.Å@Another people hold this view .     In my opinion, I believe it is important for college students to have a part-time job. This reasons for my choice are listed as follows. In the first place, with the development of society, company need a experienced employer. But college students lack a practice when they graduated from school. At college they learn acknowledge is not useful to future work..It is not link to work. They find it is very difficult to find a job. In the second place, college students have a pare-time job could get some money to reduce family pressure. They could learn the values of money when they get money by yourself. They will cherish money because of they find it is not easy to get money.     Though the above analysis. I think college students will be benefit from a part-time job. Whatever effects it has, one thing is certain, it have more positive effects than negative effects to college students. In a word, a part-time will help college students to have a chance to practice and have a better future. 
Some people maintain that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China. In their opinion, smoking is harmful not only to the smokers but also to the people around. WhatÅfs more, smoking is a waste of money, because of no advantage. When one smokes a cigarette, one is actually burning money. The smokers do not agree. They believe that smoking can helps to sharpen their mind and prevents one from sleeping, especially when they are working on a hard work. Also, the government gets lots of money from cigarette taxes, and these money can help us to make our country better. I am not a smoker, and I donÅft like smoking very much. But, I argue that the smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants. ItÅfs not realistic for preventing every smoker from smoking. As we all known, everyone has his right to choose the style of life by himself. And, of course, no one has the right to impose his way on other people. So, in my view, the smoking should be banned in all the restaurants but not completely. In other words, we should give multiple choices to persons. In some areas of restaurants smoking should be allowed, and if you are not a smoker or you donÅft like smoking, you can choose the no-smoke-area of restaurants.  
We do know that smoking does a lot of harm to our health. Every year, millions of people die of lung cancers due to smoking. Smoking is damaging people every day. Yet, smoking should not be banded completely at all the restaurants in China. My views are as follows.   Things that exist must have values. In ChinaÅfs long history, smoking dates back to centuries ago. There must be reasons why so many people smoke. Smoking can make people have a good break after exhausting physical work. Also, many women say that they feel safe when they smoke. Artists say that they have flash ideas when they smoke. Writers also say they can not write down any word without smoking. Many people also have the habit of smoking during meals. If people can not drop the habit, why not produce cigarettes with higher qualities? It will be harmless of they donÅft breathe in the toxic nicotine. Smoking should be reduced but not banned completely. Many people say they can not do anything without cigarettes. Thus, it will not be a good idea to ban smoking. People who smoke during meals will feel that nothing is tasty if they are banned smoking. It would be better that we accept that fact and think of ways to solve the problem.   In summary, banning smoking is not the only way to solve problems. Change an angle to think. Producing better and healthier cigarettes way be of vital importance. 
With the process of human's adventure, the cigarette walked into ours life. Smoking has become a habit that being discuss for a long time. As we all know, cigarette contends varies kinds of drugs that do harm to our health, and the man who addicts in smoking has a clear mind on how badly does the cigarette affect people's life. However, there is a discussion held by some people that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in china.   To my own point of view, I strongly hold the opinion that smoking should be banned in all the public place. For starters, cigarette does not only do harm to the smoker's body, the smoke when the cigarette burning contends nearly all the poisons that the cigarette has, if you smoke in the public area like restaurant, the smoke would affect other person's health who don't smoke at all! At the same time, the smell of the smoke may make the surrounding clients feel uncomfortable. Furthermore, teenagers do not have a formed standard, they do not have a clear thought on what is good or not. If they thought it is cool smoking outside, they may firm the habit that they could not easily get rid of it since they are children.   Therefore, I it is necessary for our country to banned smoking in the public like restaurant. And my suggestion is that smoking is a bad habit which do harm to both you and other surrounders, try to get rid of it.   
More and more people pick up smoking nowadays. People smoke for different reasons. Most of them smoke because of fierce competition. As far as I am concerned, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in China. As is known to all, smoking is really dangerous. It is toxic and does harm to peopleÅfs lung damagingly. It not only does harm to those who smoke but also does harm to people surrounding. Moreover, people who smoke will be addicted to it gradually and it is really difficult to drop the habit. If people smoke at the restaurants, we will not have a good atmosphere to have meals. We can not imagine how scary it would be that the air would not be clear any longer but full of smoke. We will feel that the food would not be tasty any more. That would only lead to cough. Thus, in order to have a better environment for the public, there should be no smoking at the restaurants.   To sum up, smoking is of no use. Those who are addicted to it would better kick it out as soon as possible just for you and for the public. 
In my opinion, all restaurants in China should not completely ban smoking. Instead, it is necessary for most restaurants to set a smoking area to serve smokers and other restaurants to completely ban smoking. Although the majority of people support the assertion that smoking is harmful to smokers and people near them, in reality, there are still great amount of people in China who are smokers. Once all restaurants begin to ban smoking, smokers cannot stand the period in restaurants without any cigarettes. As a result, it is possible that large groups of heavy smokers give up to eat in restaurants and instead begin to eat at home or buy fast food, which will course great reduction of restaurantsÅf profits. Thus to look round the corner, it is reasonable for restaurants to divide themselves into smoking area and non-smoking area, then smokers could enjoy their cigarettes after finishing their delicious dinner without complaint from non-smokers while non-smokers could appreciate their dinner without smoky air. As I know, the ÅgShow CoffeeÅh is among those restaurants which first begin to set smoking area and non-smoking area in China, which is largely welcomed by its customers. In addition, there are special restaurants with limited room for the division of different areas. Under this situation, all the customersÅf health is much more important that the smokersÅf addiction, so runners of those restaurants should completely ban smoking without any hesitation.
In my opinion, thereÅfs no necessary to ban smoking completely. It is known to all that it is not polite and appropriate to smoke in some public occasion. However, it is impossible to ban smoking completely at all the restaurants. Firstly, China has a long history of growing tobacco, so smoking also last for a long time in China. Smoking become a way of communication when people talk to each other, just as drinking, though both of them are not good to health. People have be accustomed to this way, and can not change the custom in a short time?a few years or tens of years. Secondly, restaurants are places for people to eat, and to smoke a cigarette after meal is most smokersÅf habit. We can not stop them doing this because that is their freedom. On the other hand, smoking may affect othersÅf health, and that is why many people object smoking at restaurants. At this time, what we could do is to persuade them not to smoke, but we don not have the right to ban them.  Thirdly, the solution of avoid smoking at restaurants may not be banning, it can be other ways. For example, the public dinning hall can be divided into two parts, one for smokers and the other for non-smokers. In that way, every one can enjoy his dinner. Anyway, I think smoking should not be banned completely at all the restaurants in China.Å@ 
As everyone knows, cigarette is not perfect goods for people's health. However, many people smoke in a few places, for example bars or restaurant, where they will have an effective communication. I do think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China. The most important reason is that it does make other people ill because they are breathing it in and smoking can deeply damage peopleÅfs health even if they donÅft smoke. Firstly, smoking is the main reason for cancers. The more people smoke the shorter the can live. It could say smoking is the chief criminal of goods which will kill people. Secondly, it is also damage people who donÅft smoke. Restaurants are public place where full of people who donÅft smoke such as children and the old. If someone smokes at the restaurant, it actually changes the atmosphere of those places. No doubt smoking is very danger to our body, and especially it is more harmful to them who donÅft smoke but breathing smoke in.    In a condition it is a must to completely ban smoking at all the restaurants in China for us and our next generation. 
 I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China.    As long as the Olympic Games was being holden in Beijing , smoking has been completely banned at all the restaurants in China. It is a truth that we all know that it is harmful for us if we smoke. And it is not only harmful for who smokes, it is also harmful for the people who are around the smoker. We go to restaurants to have dinner, not be like to let ourselves to be controlled in the harm of second smoking. Everyone have the right to let himself be in a good environment to enjoy dinner.    As we all know, such as England and France, many countries have been published the law that smoking should be banned in public place. I think the banned of smoking is one of a typical of the degree of a countryÅfs development. China is fast developing now, every one should have a good behave in the public place. As long as we know it is harmful to everyone if someone smokes in a public place, it is good to be completely banned in restaurants. 
 I agree with the statement that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China. Because I myself am one of the sufferers.   As we all know, smoking is not only harmful to the smoker but also the others around. So we have no-smoking coach on the train and no-smoking cabin on the plane. Why not the restaurants?   Someone maybe say ÅgYes, we have the no-smoking restaurants. DonÅft like the smoke? Please go there. It is not necessary to ban smoking at all the restaurants. Åh In my opinion, nobody has the right to harm other peopleÅfs health, but the law has the power to protect everyoneÅfs health. If you would like to smoke, please smoke outside or back to home, donÅft disturb others.  ThatÅfs why smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants.  
ItÅfs easily to see the scene that someone who smokes in the public places many years ago. And now we can also see it happens in some restaurants. I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. To be honest, I hate smoking. It makes the air hardly to breathe and hurt not only the smoker but also the people who are just nearby. It isnÅft healthy to smoke too much often. Many people who smoke so badly that even get a cancer.  Can you image a restaurant which is filled with the smoke when you just open the door? Do you want to have a meal at there any more? ItÅfs easily to see the answers .And if there is a baby who is taken there by his parents, how badly it is. Most women donÅft like smoke and they also donÅft like others smoke before them. If you want to have a good impression on them, smoke is the worst choice. TO ban the smoking is not just be good for the manÅfs healthy, but also for the environment. We will have a happy time as we are have the healthy air in the restaurants. How nice it is! 
Doctors suggest that smoking is definitely bad for human health, not only for the people who smoke, but also for someone who is beside them. Smoking has been banned in many places, but I donÅft think it should be banned at all the restaurants in China.       That is because I think itÅfs unnecessary to do so. Actually there is few people smoking in restaurants, and if they want to smoke, they will go outside. ItÅfs probably because they will feel uneasy if the taste of the dishes become strange or not delicious for their reasons. On the other hand, it is a little unfair to deprive their rights to smoke at all places. Most restaurants have separated rooms today. If people smoke in restaurants, they canÅft be in a hurry, and if so they would like to choose a separated room rather than to stay in the lobby. So they wonÅft pollute the whole air of the restaurant. As to the small room where they stay, there is likely someone who fond of smoking like them. It really doesnÅft matter that much. People who smoke just canÅft help to smoking sometimes. If we donÅft allow them to smoke they will feel very uncomfortable. Restaurant is different from any other public places. They can avoid or decrease the time to go to other public places. For example, smoking is banned at railway stations, they can go to the waiting room later so that they need not to smoke before they get on. But no one can avoid going to restaurants. Everybody need to have meals everyday. This kind of restrictions will trouble them a lot.        Above all, I donÅft think itÅfs necessary to ban smoking at all the restaurants in China. 
I donÅft think that smoking should be banned at all the restaurant in China. In my opinion, when we want to do something, first we should plan it and then do it step by step. The present situation of Chinese restaurant is that these even no smoking area or smoking banned area. And on the other hand, it doesnÅft necessary to banned smoking at all the restaurant if there has smoking section and smoking banned section. And chinaÅfs population is so large that among them the smoking people is not a small number. The amount of restaurant in china is unimagined. To ban smoking at all the restaurant is a real risk.  
As far as I am concerned, smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in China . Smoking produces bad smell .If smoking is allowed in the restaurants ,guests would feel disgusting and the wall in the room is easy to become yellowish ,which is bound to have a bad effect on the business because almost all the customers esp. the would prefer the non-smoking places to have a meal instead of where smoking smell are filled . Some may hold the view that the banning may be makes some people reluctant to enter the restaurants ,but I donÅft think it is true .Customers would not refuse to keep themselves from smoking just for so short time ,no one must smoke during their mealtime . Moreover, statistics show that majority of the customers say that they would come to have a meal as usual .And take the airports and the cinema for example, where smoking has been banned for more than 10 years, the number of the passengers wasnÅft declined due to the policy at all .On the contrary, some restaurants become more popular with customers after the banning has started . Ireland has already put this policy into use since 2004 throughout the whole country, followed by so many European countries, and British even use the strict punishment to make smoking banned, all which tells us that smoking are sincerely regarded to be unhealthy and the banning throughout the country is becoming a unavoidable trend .So why donÅft China follow the trend which could absolutely benefit us in the long run? Some countries even rule that smoking is only allowed in peopleÅfs home . All in all, I suppose smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in China. 
I suppose that smoking should be completely banned at any restaurant in china. Firstly, in terms of health, as is widely known to everybody, smoking is definitely very harmful to peopleÅfs health. And what is worse, people who are around smokers will get second-hand smoking which does even more serious damage to health than the smoker himself. I suppose we can put it as Åg harm set, harm get Åh. It is quite easy to imagine a picture that in a restaurant, which is quite limited space, customers are talking and eating happily, however, several smokers make the restaurant foggy here and there, and while the other customers are enjoying themselves, unconsciously, inhaling victim smoker all the time and very likely to be suffocated by the dirty air. Especially when children is in this restaurant, I can hardly imagine what effect will it do year by year, but no doubt, things will turn out terrible. WhatÅfs more, if the smoker uncarefully drops the cigarette on the carpet or doesnÅft stub the cigarette out completely, it will quite probably cause an accidental fire, which is apparently a very dangerous thing. From my point of view, smoking is really troublesome and has potential risks. I advocate that smoking should be completely banned in restaurants in china. 
Although some people hold the view that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China, others opposite it.   The people who support that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China think that smoking is not only bad for the smokerÅfs own health, but also has bad influence on other peopleÅfs health. Secondhand smoke clearly kills people and the only way to control it is to ban smoking. Banning smoking in the restaurants is very good news for non-smokers, so that they can go out of restaurants and return home without nasty smelling. WhatÅfs more, smoking kills thousands of people and this is the best way to discourage people from smoking.   Others, however, look at this question in a totally different way and they hold that itÅfs unnecessary to ban smoking at all the restaurants in China. First of all, everyone has the right to decide whether smoke or not, some people believe that smoking can make them feel relax. Furthermore, the taxation of the cigarette contributes a lot to the National finance income. If smoking is banned in all the restaurants in China, a large number of people will lose job. At the same time, the customer of the restaurants will definitely reduce.   As far as IÅfm concerned, smoking brings serious health consequence, and the pollution to other people's atmospheres also makes it an environmental issue. But I also think that people have the right to choose whether smoke or not. On the other handÅCitÅfs undeniable that selling cigarettes bring huge profits to our country and the people whose work related to it. So the best way to deal with this problem is to have the smoking area and non-smoking area in all the restaurants instead of banning smoking at all the restaurants. 
Should smoking be completely banned at all the restaurants in China? Many people think so, I think it is a very realistic problem. As we all know, smoking is bad to our health. WhatÅfs more, it`s influence people around you. Restaurants is a place that you should pay attention to your behavior and manner very well. So from this point, smoking should be banned in the restaurants. But in the other hand, however, don`t think so. Some people feel that smoking shouldn`t be banned at the restaurants. In fact, it is a complicated thing. We cannot lightly say ÅgshouldÅh or ÅgshouldnÅftÅh. It influenced by many factors, first of all, it is difficult for government to control smoking people`s quantity. And if there has supplies, there has needs. If smoking is not be allowed in the restaurants, what will the people who really want to smoking do? In case of myself, I think instead of smoking in our own seats, the restaurants should make some special places for us to smoking. It will not only good for smokers, but also the others. However, it`s easier said than done. Only in reality we van know whether it is good or bad. 
   I do not like smoking at all . Many my classmates smoke and more and more classmates smoke . In my opinion I think smoking should completely banned .Firstly smoking is bad to health not just for the smokers but also for others who beside those smokers, for instants children and classmates . Secondly smokers need money to smoke . Some people everyday smokes very much and has to takes much time to smoke. What is worse , no people like the man whose month is bad smell and if people who you know smokes you must be influenced badly. Smoking is the worst thing that human produced I think .Now it is difficult to completely ban smoking . In the world now many people is smoking and at the same time many people dead because smoking. Those people are not worth to die and many of them have skills have ability to contribute to the world ,but they dead .Why ? just because smoking ! Smoking should completely banned for our children for our health for our future. No smoking has called long time we must contribute to it .   All above is my opinion .That is all.
AGREE. I am quite with this statement. I donÅft want to talk about whether it is good or not to smoke . the result is so clear. And I can understand why so many people still keep smoking will themselves know ÅhSMOKING IS BAD TO HEALTHÅh clearly. ItÅfs their habit.    But smoking in public should be banned . public place is a place where everyday a mess of people gather at including children women with babies and old people. Smoking is a habit of who is smoking ,but these guys have no rights to do harm to the people without the bad habit.   So I am agree with the statement.     Maybe someone think itÅfs much better to divide the restaurants into two part ÅgSMOKING ALLOWED Åg ones and ÅgSMOKING BANNEDÅh ones.  But I donÅft think so. for the fact that it is clear that smoking is bad to our health.  So  we should try to get everyone  out  of  the bad habit, and making every restaurants and even every public places no-smoking is also a great way by making smokers fell that they are not accepted by the others with the bad habit, and I believe that between smoking and being accept by public ,most people will choose the last one. 
  I donÅft quite agree with this. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in China, customs who like smoking will go to the restaurants less often just because they are not allowed smoking, This will lead to the fact that the restaurants will make less money. It is not good for both the customs and the restaurants, I think.    Then smoking is allowed at all the restaurants? The answer is NO. If so maybe it is the turn for the customs who donÅft smoke not to go to the restaurants less often. So what shall we do? I think the restaurants maybe can set a smoking-room for the smokers. If they want to smoke, they can just go to the smoking-room and enjoy their time smoking. Just as usual as going to the toilet. And the smoking-room costs no money.    As is known to all, smoking has a bad effect on our health, but we canÅft force the people who smoke not to smoke. It depends on themselves but not us. To protect the people who donÅft smoke, what we can do is to separate them from the smokers. ThatÅfs my opinion.  
As the level of our lives becoming higher, we have more chances to patronize restaurants, cheap or expensive. At restaurants, itÅfs not difficult to find people having dinner during smoking. People just like me who disgusts with smoking   are always choked by the smoke. So I support that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China, if there are no special areas in restaurants for smokers.           Not only because that I dislike smoking but also because that this action may leave a bad memory on tourists form foreign countries. As china is becoming a international country, especially after we holding the Olympic games successfully, we should pay more attention to our activities not to lose face for our grand country. WhatÅfs more, itÅfs a bad habit to smoke over a dinner for it will has a bad effect on your somatic and nervous system.       All in all ,I believe that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China. 
 Personally, I totally agree with this statement. And I have two points here to support my opinion.    Firstly, smoking in public places, such as restaurants, is really harmful to the public health. It is widely acknowledged that the second-hand smoking could do significant harm to the people around you. WhatÅfs moreÅCbeing a decent person in this developing society requires every individual to take the responsibility to the whole community in every occasion. Therefore, banning smoking at all the restaurant is necessary and it can contribute to both the public health and showing our respect to others.    Secondly, banning smoking at restaurants can help to achieve a graceful environment for enjoying a tasty meal and communication. Apparently, in some cases, people go to restaurants for communication rather than food alone. And the stingy smell, such as smoke, can definitely disturb the atmosphere of talking. Anyway, banning smoking at all the restaurant does not indicate that it is inhuman or inconsiderate, having noticed in some restaurants that they provided the customers a rest room to handle their personal need for release themselves.    Based on those two points I have stressed, IÅfm in favor of the policy: Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China. 
 I donÅft quite agree with this. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in China, customs who like smoking will go to the restaurants less often just because they are not allowed smoking, This will lead to the fact that the restaurants will make less money. It is not good for both the customs and the restaurants, I think.    Then smoking is allowed at all the restaurants? The answer is NO. If so maybe it is the turn for the customs who donÅft smoke not to go to the restaurants less often. So what shall we do? I think the restaurants maybe can set a smoking-room for the smokers. If they want to smoke, they can just go to the smoking-room and enjoy their time smoking. Just as usual as going to the toilet. And the smoking-room costs no money.    As is known to all, smoking has a bad effect on our health, but we canÅft force the people who smoke not to smoke. It depends on themselves but not us. To protect the people who donÅft smoke, what we can do is to separate them from the smokers. ThatÅfs my opinion.  
In my opinion, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in China. Firstly, smoking is bad for our body, because it can damage many organs. It is known that many of people get ill because of it, and some of the diseases even cannot be cured , as a result ,what is waiting for them is death. Secondly, smoking is not only bad for smokers but for people around them. Scientists have shown that the most serious victims are people around you when you smoking ,because the most polluted air is smoked by them not you .Maybe many of people are surprise at the fact and cannot believe it ,but it is the truth. Thirdly, if we have realized the badness of smoking and have decided to ban smoking , the government should do a favour so that restaurants all over the country can ban it together .The reason is that if only a few restaurants did it , people who like smoking will think that it were strange or unfair. As a result, they may choose another restaurant that does not ban it , instead. After a long time , banning smoking restaurants may give up , because their customs are decreasing , and what they have done is in vain . In a word , smoking is bad for not only you but me . It is better to ban it not only in restaurants but in anywhere.      
We all know that smoking is harmful to our health. But at the same time somebody also canÅft get themselves out from the unforgettable feelings brought by smoking. For that I think no smoking is necessary for person. Long time ago, a Chinese who called Lin Zexu raised the first activity of no smoking. Because smoking is not only do harm to our bodies but also poison people's mindsÅCit makes people donÅft want to study, to work, even to play. Maybe nowadays smoking wonÅft cause such phenomenon, but it also do harm to the lungs of people who smoke. Every year a lot of people die of lung disease caused by smoking, and people who smoke also live a shorter life than people who not smoke.  So that I agree with no smoking. If people smoke less, they will live more happily, and so do their family and friends. Nothing is more important than having a good health. 
It is fairly well that smoking in the restaurant is a bad behave which harms both the health of the smoker and others in the restaurant. But from my point of view, forbid it completely is impossible.   Suppose smoking is completely banned at all in the restaurant people may smoke outside it and then get into. Then the provisions will with no meaning.   It is well known that even though the tax of cigarettes is very high, the number of people who smoke is still very high. Therefore, forbidding smoking in all the restaurant is not a fundamental method to make people away from cigarettes.   Moreover, the restaurants in china are of different levels. And people in china also have different level of education. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in China, there will be a lot of people who canÅft understand it and it will also have a bad influence on those small restaurants.   Considering the possible consequence above, I think it is reasonable to forbid smoking in high-grade restaurants, but forbidding smoking in all the restaurants at all is unrealistic and not feasible.  
 Now more and more people smoking in public,I think it doesnÅft only influence the smokers,but also have a strong impact on the other peopleÅfs healthy.So,I think smoking must be completely banned in China especially at all the restaurants.   Now let us have a conjecture,you are having dinner with your friends at a good restaurant.You are happily eating and chatting with each other.Then suddenly,you smell the unpleasant smell of cigarette,and then,when you eat your food,you will feel bad and canÅft swallow it only because the smoke is so strong.I think you must not be happy any more.So,I must tell the people who smoke at restaurants can you stop smoking at public for the purpose of themselves and others.    Think of this matter from the angle of the doctors,smoke have a very bad influence on peopleÅfs trachea,when human are eating,their tracheas are expanding,if breathe much smoke at this time,people are very easy to have tracheitis, bronchitis and other diseases like these.    In a word,smoking is bad for peopleÅfs healthy,smoking at restaurants is worse.Now,in China,this matter is very serious,so,we must help ourselves,when we see others smoking at restaurants,we should put a stop to them. 
Nowadays, more and more people in China get to contribute the habit of smoking. Not only the men, but also the women ,even some teenagers. As we all know, smoking does bad to our health especially when we have meals, so we should get away from it. Firstly, many fire disasters are resulted from smoking against regulations. If smoking can be completely banned at all the restaurants in China, we can avoid many tragedies.  Secondly , according to the scientists , it has the worst influence to our body if we inhalant the smoking gas while we are eating. So, we should not smoke at the eating time or in the restaurants.  WhatÅfs more , it does more harm to peopleÅfs health who indirectly inhalant the smoking gas than those who smokes directly. Just the restaurants always have many children there. For the health of the younger generation , adults should keep not smoking in the restaurants.  Last but not the least , in order to keep a good mood of enjoying the delicious food in restaurants , adults had better get away from smoking just a moment . 
I donÅft think banning smoking at all the restaurants in China is a good idea. ItÅfs no doubt that smoking do harm with our health.The best situation is that no one smokes any more,so smokers and those people around them can have a better life.But absolutely,it can never bu true.Since the fact is there are so many people smoking and canÅft keep away from it,such tough rule canÅft work well.We should also think of them. So in my opinion,the best way is set up smoking areas in the restaurants.Those smokers can smoking only in the areas.And of course,no-smoking areas is more than smoking areas.In this way,most of us can get rid of being affected with smog.Also smoker can have their space to Ågenjoy themselvesÅh. I hope maybe this way can reduce the number of smokers a little 
As everyone knows ,smoking isnÅft good to our health ,so dose smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants ? It is said that smoking is harmful not only to our health but also to the air. Smoking can lead to many diseases, such as lung cancer. Smoking affects non smokers more than it does smokers. According to a survey, the rate of passive smokers getting ill is higher than that of smokers. So, many nonsmokers are against smoking.      In restaurants, the harm of smoking is greater. ItÅfs not only bad to themselves and worse to others but also it pollutes environment by giving much poisonous gas off  into the air.     Therefore, that the government ban smoking is very necessary and important to us. It is a measure to protect our health and environment. So many people, especially nonsmokers are for the policy. Some people may say that it takes away some of their freedom. I think it is a one-sided view. If one wants to smoke, he may smoke in private, not in the restaurants. In fact, smokers still have the freedom of smoking.      But, I think, smokers had better give up smoking, not only in private places, but also everywhere. It will be beneficial to all of us. 
I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China. Restaurant is the place for us to have meals and relax. ItÅfs really hard for a man who never smoke to stand a people nearby smoke during meals.  Most of us wonÅft like a restaurant with strange smell, but itÅfs hard for them to clean up the smell, and provide the next consumer with a clean environment to have meals. As all of us know, smoking is harmful to our health, which is banned in most of the public place, but why it canÅft be banned in the restaurants? This is because the managers of the restaurants afraid that they will lose many consumers if other restaurants donÅft do the same thing. Their fears come from that most of the people go to the restaurants are adults, and in China, many of the men smoke when they grow up. If they ban it, it means keep lots of people out of the door, but they should also think that if smoking is allowed in the restaurants, they will lose many consumers who hate smoking, too. I think, the one who should take measures is our country, not the restaurants. Like the plastic bags, its just a small case. ItÅfs the best way, I think. 
As we know , smoking is harmful not only to our health but also to the environment. Smoking can lead to many diseases, such as lung cancer. smoking affects non-smokers more than it dose smoker. Ratio of passive smokers getting ill is higher than that of smoker. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. As far as I am concerned, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in china.  Restaurants are also public place. There are many non-smokers. at restaurants, the harm of smoking is greater. Smoking can affect customersÅf mind if smokers are around. And smoking do great harm to non-smokers. It is unfair for them. I think it is laughable if there is some one who is smoking at a clean restaurant. Smoking pollutes environment by giving much poisonous vapour off into the air. the government ban smoking at restaurant  is very necessary and important to us.  It is a measure to protect our health and environment.  Some people say that it takes away some of our freedom. I think it is a one-sided view. If one wants to smoke, he may smoke in private, not in the public places include restaurants. In fact, smokers still have the freedom of smoking. But, I think, smokers had better give up smoking, not only in private places, but also in the public places, everywhere. It will be beneficial to all of us. 
We all know that itÅfs harmful for people to smoke whether in his 20s or his 50s.Å@It seems that smokers are becoming younger and the number larger.Å@And people pay more attention to smoking.Å@But I donÅft think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China and itÅfs impossible to do that too.Å@There may be some people are strongly against smoking and they just canÅft stand the smell.Å@We can just open up some restaurants that ban smoking or make a part of the restaurants named no-smoking areas.     When we entire the society,Å@smoking is not just a form of entertainment, but a way of communication. Of course, smoking a lot is absolutely not allowed. IÅfm non-smoker and I donÅft know how beautiful the cigarette is that so many people are addicted to it. I donÅft want to smoke in the future either. Since smoking canÅft be banned at once we should make up our mind to do something. Not to ban it at all the restaurants but to let people know how harmful it is. And let more and more people experience the happiness of clear air and clear mouth. At that time we neednÅft to ban it and people just donÅft want to smoke neither in the restaurants nor somewhere else.  
People smoke for many things,some for fatigue,some just for the wonderful feelings.There seems to be good to the smokers,and however, their bodies have been always remonstrating.   At present, so many public places have signs say, No smoking. This is because people are gradually aware of the harm of smoking. LetÅfs try to have a scene: when you are sitting in a beautiful restaurant, having some delicious food that is your favorite. At that time, smokers are around you which makes you hard to breath, let along eat food.You must want a waiter to keep the smoker away or out of the restaurant so that you could continue your dinner.   There actually exist another scene: when you are off work, you are tired, so tired that you donÅft want to go home to do the supper yourself. Suddenly there appears a restaurant. Dragging yourself in, sitting in the soft sofa. you light a cigarette. you would think that°Øs the most wonderful things in your life. There comes the waiter, who are keeping you away from your beautiful  dream, this time you are so much wanting there isnÅft a rule that smoking isnÅft banned.   That is the fact, different people have different ideas around one thing. Generally speaking, smoking to the smoker as not a bed thing. but when happens in a public place like a restaurant where there are some propel dislike smoking,it should be banned. 
As ChineseÅfs conscious of public manner and healthy problems greatly developed, there has been a general discussion over smoking, one of the questions under debate is whether smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China.  In my point of view, smoking in public is so bad a thing that should not only be banned at restaurants but also all the public places such as hospitals and shopping malls for following reasons.  First and foremost, no one can deny that smoking does harm to peopleÅfs body. According to a recent survey, about four million people die each year from diseases linked to smoking. I have seen a short movie online ? an experiment which shows the extreme horrible results of having been smoked 400 cigarettes. The chemical substance contained in cigarettes can be left in blood vein for many years just like poison. Moreover, when smokers ease their nerves and pressures by smoking, they themselves only breathe in 30% of the tobacco, whereas people nearby breathe in the rest through the second-hand smoking.  Besides, there comes the statistics showing that many of fire accidents occur each year due to the thrown cigarettes ends.  Last but not least, restaurants are places for people to enjoy delicious food , not to bear tobacco. Most female and children canÅft have a comfortable environment while someone are smoking, let along being forced to breathe the unpleasant smell.  In the end ,IÅfm in favor of the discussion of banning smoking at all restaurants in China completely .  
I must say smoking in the restaurant is very impolite.Å@It may destroy other's appetite and do harm to the health of others.   As a non-smoke person, I hate the smoke which is made by smokers in every place at every time. So if someone advice banning smoking at restaurant, I will put up two hands to show my agreement. And I believe that it will must be banned someday.   However, as a big country with a large amount of smokers, banning all of them smoking in the restaurant is not easy. Most of them will be against it and may say that it harms their rights. The host of the restaurant will hate the rule more than the smokers, because it will have a bad effect on their making money. The unwillingness of the most important two roles--the smokers and host will delay the process of banning the smokers smoke in the restaurant and become a big problem when the government perform the rule.   But the rule that banning smokers smoke in the restaurant is good to the majority and have much more supporters. What's more, it have to do with a nation's image. So the government should ban smoking in restaurant to meet the most people's requirement. 
I agree with the statement that the smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China.I have some  reasons and specific details to support my answer.   In my opinion, smoking at restaurants is doing more harm than good. On the one hand, smoking is bad for our health. Moreover, if you smoking at the restaurants, it not only does harm to your body,but also has bad effects on other's health. On another hands, smoking will give off a large amount of poisonous gas which will pollute the fresh air. Especially, at the restaurants is impossible for the gas to get through. So smoking at the restaurants causes more harms than at outside. In addition, smoking is a waste of money that we can use for some meaningful things.    I also think that carrying out the statement is of benefit to us. It is helpful to build up our bodies, so that we can live a healthy life. Besides,it is also contributed to improve quality the of the restaurant' air, which will bring a refreshing environment for people who have dinner at restaurants. What's more, it helps us to develop good and healthy habits.    In one word,the statement that smoking should be completely banned at restaurants in China is necessary for us. If it will be carried out ,I will do my best to support it. That' all. 
I donÅft agree with the statement that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in China. First, I want to say, one kind functions of smoking is relaxing oneself. And for a lot of restaurants in China, the slogan is Ågcustomer is the God, we will do whatever to fill GodÅfs needs.Åh So if their God want to relax himself by smoking, how can they stop him? Then, we have to face a reality, that in China, especially for Chinese businessmen, cigarette and wine are the most common way to make their relations closer, which means that they are helpful to their cooperation. How such a useful way should be banned? Maybe in one way, it can influent our economy development.  I think the reason why people want to ban smoking at the restaurant is it make the air terrible. In fact, many restaurants have thought about it, they set the non-smoking rooms and smoking rooms, which is really convenient for all the people.   Everyone has his right to enjoy himself at the restaurants, so itÅfs really not a good rule to ban people to smoke.   
 I totally support the statement.    Smoking is harmful not only to smokers but also to the people around, not to say in the restaurants. No one has the right to harm others. But as we know some people canÅft help smoking in the restaurants, so government should do something to ban it.    What is restaurant? Restaurant is not only the place we have lunch and dinner, it is also the place we have rest and lighten ourselves. Imagine that you are in a restaurant which is full of smoke, what you want to do now? The first thing I will do is run away from the lousy place.  In fact, I think it is very rude to smoke in the restaurant. I the restaurant, we often meet some foreigners. No matter what we say or what we do represent our country, our China. The famous newspaper <<New York Times >> has said that china is the most civilized ancient country in the world. But in the daily life, what we Chinese do not show this. Smoking in the restaurants will let the foreigners feel down about us.  Also, if the restaurants are small, smoking will easily cause a fire. As for the reasons above, smoking should be banned in all of chinaÅfs restaurants. 
Ancients believed that tobacco is a harmful for human-beings.In modern times,it also may cause dyspnea, cough, sputum and wheezing, and so on.    Smoking can be a hobby ,but if harms other health ,a hobby may change to a killer.especially in public places.   If pregnant women smoking,it may have bad effect to a new-born baby.Morever,enviornment are seriously polluted.   Once, an advertisement said ,in order that there is no hole in the carpet,and there is no hole in your lung,please not smoke in public.That is really true. Government is really think carefully for our lives ,our earth.   So ,Stop  smoking in the restaurant is really necessary!  
It is widely known by people in the world that smoking is bad for our health. Many people die for the lung cancer which caused by smoke. And it is more dangerous for the people who don not smoke themselves but their friends, relatives or colleagues smoke a lot. It is said that it does two times harm to others and to themselves. So to smoke in the public is irresponsible.   As above says, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in china. But this needs time and rules. Because china has a large population, the number of smokers is deserved large. Now many people have realized that there are only harms to smoke without benefit. And a lot of smokers choose to quit smoking. But this need a good condition, in some restaurants in china the smell of cigarettes is so strong that many people especially woman and children  
We all know that itÅfs harmful for people to smoke whether in his 20s or his 50s.It seems that smokers are becoming younger and the number larger.And people pay more attention to smoking.But I donÅft think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China and itÅfs impossible to do that too.There may be some people are strongly against smoking and they just canÅft stand the smell.We can just open up some restaurants that ban smoking or make a part of the restaurants named no-smoking areas.     When we entre the society,smoking is not just a form of entertainment,but a way of communication.Of course,smoking a lot is absolutely not allowed.IÅfm non-smoker and I donÅft know how beautiful the cigeratte is that so many people are addicted to it.I donÅft want to smoke in the future either.Since smoking canÅft be banned at once we should make up our mind to do something.Not to ban it at all the restaurants but to let people know how harmful it is.And let more and more people expierence the happiness of clear air and clear mouth.At that time we neednÅft to ban it and people just donÅft want to smoke neither in the restaurants nor somewhere else.  
 It is universally acknowledged that smoking has a great influence on our health However, the trend of smoking has gone from bad to worse.  Wherever it is,we can see people are smoking.For smoking has a long history ,it is impossible to forbid all men to smoke at once, but it is possible to ban it at the restaurants in China.It is time the authorities concerned took proper steps to solve the smoking problem.  In fact ,on no account can we ignore the harm of smoking .The recent statistics show that a great many people get cancer because of cigarette.What is more every year thousands of people are killed by smoking either directly or indirectly .  Restaurants are crowded with people ,when people smoke in it, it will be drowned in smoke.Then all the people become smokes weather they like it or not.  Moreover,many people are similar to the smoke,when they are in such a smoky world,they may feel uncomfortable and have no appetite.Becides,if they  pregnant women, it can affect their babies directly.Therefor,cigarette is threatening our health in its way.  So precious is life that we can not afford to destroy it,and nothing is more important than to ban smoking. 
 I donÅft agree the statement that smoking should be completely banned at the restaurants in China.  IÅfm not a smoker, and I donÅft like people smoking around me. But I still donÅft think it is not a good idea to completely forbid people smoking at the restaurants in China.  On one hand, smoking is not forbidden by the whole society. All the countries have no such laws that completely forbidding smoking. Though nicotine makes people get addicted, making people die earlier. This is quite similar as drugs. The reason that tobacco has never been banned is that great amount of taxes are paid by the smokers and tobacco companies. This has been a important part of all the tax income to the governments.  So rights are given to the people. Smoking is not about affecting people nearby, itÅfs more like a right of freedom and fairness. Since governments never banned smoking, in my opinion, dividing guests into smoking area and non-smoking area at the restaurants would be a great idea for now.  But I am looking forward to the day that all tobacco is forbidden all over the world, not only in Chinese restaurants. 
At recently, there is a heated view whether smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in China. With the development of the society, Smoking has became a world problem. there are more and more people to smoke. Many people think pressure of family, work, life lead to smoke. Though smoker have many reasons to smoke. they think smoking is own thing. But in my opinion ,Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China. On the one hand, Smoking will be effect peopleÅfs health and life. People will have a bad effects. Some people start to smoke when they are young. When they stop to smoke they feel terrible. They will feel headache. Whatever they do, they donÅft have no action. On the other hand, when you smoke in restaurants, you will be effect other peopleÅfs  health. It have worse effects. it will destroy restaurants environment. And non-smoker will be terrible. So smoker effect another .They maybe do not find their action will hurt anther people. Though analysis of above, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China. The government could make law to forbid smoking in restaurants. And it warn smoking will effect yourself and another peopleÅfs health. It will many good aspects to life. In a word, Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China.  
Now more and more people are smoking, especially in some public places, such as restaurant. So smoking is becoming a problem for us.    As we all know, smoking is bad for our health, our organ?lungs. But since the cigarette has been as a kind of social customs which widely used in our society, the ÅgNo SmokingÅh seems to be difficult.    In my opinion, I think smoking should be banned in the restaurant. The first reason, smoking will lead to the disaster?fire. When people go to the restaurant, they enjoy themselves very much, so that they may forget the consciousness of fire prevention. Especially when some men drink a lot and become unconscious, some accident will happen. ItÅfs terrible, and the consequence is unimagined. The second, I think the smoking is worse for the other people around the smokers. It is said that smoking indirectly is worse for health than smoking directly. The third, cigarette not only costs money but also ruins our body. I canÅft find any advantages from it. Last, if someone is addicted to it, he canÅft drop it easily. 
 I donÅft agree with the statement.   Firstly, I think it is impossible to make everyone not smoke at all the restaurants in China. Because there were too many restaurants in China.   Secondly, I think it is not necessary to ban people to smoke at all the restaurants.    If we donÅft want to make others smoke the second-hand smoke, we can make no-smoking place for them to go.    As there are so many people in China, it is difficult to practice the rule.    But I think we can change the rule into another way. We can ask people to smoke at smoking rooms.    Comparing with banning smoking at restaurants, I think it is better to tell smokers how bad it is to smoke and make themselves stop smoking.   So I donÅft agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China.    
I disagree with this statement for several reasons.  While it can be argued that having a part-time job is valuable preparation for a full-time job that the student will acquire upon graduation, this is often not the case. In many cases, any part-time employment obtained by a student will be in a field, and of a nature that is completely unrelated to that of their chosen course of study. For example, a student studying engineering has very little valuable experience to gain from working as a waiter in a restaurant.   Moreover, there is ample reason for students to not engage in part-time employment. Such a job can often mean a considerable amount of additional stress on top of that created by their studies. The stress of studying can also be increased, as there is less time available to accomplish it. Additionally, many part-time jobs can leave one tired, and thus unable to focus effectively on their studies?resulting in a lower quality of school work being produced.  Therefore, if a part-time job related to the studentsÅf field of study can be found (such as an internship), then it may be worth pursuing, but otherwise part-time employment should only be sought if it is necessary for financial reasons (i.e., to pay tuition fees). 
Yes, I agree that college students should have part-time jobs. Time is money as they say. And if you have a little extra time, then making some extra money is not so bad for the following reasons:-  To begin with, today's job market has become highly competitive and in most of the cases a college degree does not guarantee a job or a job that pays well. Most of the advertisements that appear in the newspapers or on on-line portals, the preferred candidates even for entry level positions are with some experience. As a college student, there are several ways to acquire experience that are career oriented such as internships, practical experiences. Another option is a part-time job.  Part-time jobs offer several benefits to the college students. Primarily, the financial benefit. Apart from this, part time employment lays the foundation of the work history for the future. For this reason, students should carefully consider and select their part-time positions in order to acquire valuable work skill. By carefully selecting job, the gaps in the academic qualification can be minimized; also experience makes the candidate more attractive to the potential employers. Part-time employment helps to gain a better understanding of the chosen career field.  Part-time employment, whether in a corporate organization or hotel industry helps to evolve skills important to a potential employer. These skills may include leadership skills, commitment, team spirit and interpersonal skills, time management and taking criticism positively. Besides the knowledge gained through the educational experiences, employers today are pursuing candidates who are productive with well developed overall personality and are able to assimilate themselves into the environment of the organization. The skills that are learnt through part-time position will expand and increase skills and abilities at the same time benefiting financially. 
    I agree with the statement that college students should have part-time jobs. There are two reasons for this.     The first reason is the money issue. Many college students complain that they donÅft have enough money to spend even on food at times. Having a part-time job gives students that extra money they may need in such an emergency. Saving the money earned through work a little at a time is also a good idea. The alternative is asking others, like parents or friends, for money. However, doing so again and again may put some strains on the relationships with the people you borrowed from. They may eventually see you as a ÅevampireÅf. This is especially true with friends. College students need to show that theyÅfre putting the effort into keeping themselves financially stable. People are more willing to help when you need money, if they see that you are trying to do something on your part to earn money.     The other reason for having a part-time job while in college is work experience. Of course, having a part-time job that is related to your major is an advantage. For example, if your major is teaching and you take a part-time job tutoring high school students, you will have a chance to put into use some of the theories and practices you learned in the classes you are taking. By doing this, youÅfll know what works well and what doesnÅft. Having a part-time job unrelated to your major could also benefit you by expanding your horizons thus increasing your job opportunities after college.     In conclusion, I encourage all students to take part-time jobs because it is a good opportunity for them to do something productive not only for their present situations but also their futures.  
Japanese college students should not have part-time jobs. They have enough distractions as it is. Moreover, part-time jobs are not real jobs, and therefore will not provide useful experience.   Japanese society is highly specialized. Workers are not expected to function well in a broad range of contexts. They are expected to do one job and do it well. Evaluations are all important. Workers must be familiar with what others have done in their area of specialty. If they don't know what others have done, whatever they might produce will not fit in. Neither they, nor what they produce, will be valuable to society. Learning what others have done is a full-time job by itself.   Because it's external to their subject, part-time work will interfere with their grades, and with specialization. It's usually menial work, not fit for a specialist, not real work at all. Such experience is useless when they get their jobs in their chosen fields.  Internships are not part-time jobs. They are obtained in the field of specialty, and thus provide relevant experience. And the money they provide is not enough to be another source of temptation. Internships are all they need.  Japanese colleges provide club activities to help students socialize. These activities are sufficient to teach them how to behave in society. Part-time jobs will only take them away from club activities and give them unstructured social experiences with unpredictable results. They become unwilling and unable to fit in with their fellow students and teachers.  Part-time work that is available to college students is unworthy of the finely honed workers Japanese society demands.
I strongly believe that itÅfs important for all students to have a part-time job. The main reason for this is that I believe students can gain a lot of valuable life experience and preparation for life after graduation through entering the workforce prior to their graduation. Many recently-graduated students are woefully unprepared for the realities and responsibilities of full-time employment. This can be particularly true for university students. The nature of university life is such that one can become used to staying up late at night, sleeping in late, neglecting their commitments (i.e., classes), with little or no immediate repercussions. As a result, it can often be difficult for students to make the necessary lifestyle adjustment upon graduation and subsequent employment. A part-time job, undertaken while still pursuing one's studies, can be quite helpful in this regard. Maintaining a part-time job while studying can also be a valuable exercise in personal financial management. Many recent graduates similarly have difficulty in managing their finances responsibly. In many western countries, this unfortunate reality often combines with high levels of debt (on credit cards, student loans, etc.) to leave many recent graduates in grave financial peril. A part-time job can help by not only providing experience in managing personal cash flow, but also provide at least a small amount of income with which to counter such debts. A part-time job is a very good idea for students. 
For several reasons, I largely agree with this statement.  Firstly, having been a college student myself, I am aware of the financial pressures generated as a result of college tuition fees and living expenses. Often, these expenses are met through a combination of loans, grants or family savings, and they usually restrict the student's lifestyle during a crucial period in their adult development. For college students, earning a little extra money is a constructive way of easing these financial pressures and allowing them to lead a more independent and adult lifestyle.  Secondly, with regards to employment prospects, the level of qualification obtained by the student is rarely the only factor that employers will consider. For the majority of graduate jobs, professional and transferable skills, such as the ability to communicate with customers and to be responsible with their time, are almost as important as academic achievement. Not only is a part-time job a valuable way of demonstrating these attributes, but it also gives students an idea of what aspects of employment they enjoy and what to expect of working life once they graduate.  Thirdly, on a wider scale, part-time jobs are a necessity in an economical sense. Many businesses require a work force that is flexible and students are very valuable in this regard, as they are able to fill part-time positions that would otherwise be difficult to fill with a full-time member of staff.    In contrast to these arguments however, it must also be argued that the ability of a student to cope with a job and their academic commitments depends strongly on the student's personal situation. This is largely determined by their financial condition, their year of study and the type of course they are pursuing.  
I believe that working during school builds valuable skills, encourages students to have a financial stake in their education, and prepares them for the real world they will encounter after college.  ThereÅfre countless skills that can be acquired from any part-time job. The most readily apparent skills have to do with balancing school work and the responsibilities of one's job. Skills like prioritization, multitasking, and balancing responsibilities are all important to finding success as an adult, and working while going to college provides the perfect training ground to improve these skills.  Too often the financial burden of a college education is supported entirely by a student's parents, with the consequence that students have little concept of the actual cost of their education. Without a financial "stake" in the true cost of their education, students often don't place the importance in their studies that they would were the fees for classes coming out of their own pockets. That is where a part-time job can help, by allowing students to contribute more to the cost of their education, and by giving them a better understanding of the value of money by having to earn it themselves.  Many students find it difficult to transition from the world of the college campus to the work world following graduation. College campuses are unique environments where the passion for learning and discovery are cultivated. ItÅfs very important that colleges continue to maintain this environment where one can explore talents and interests to the full extent of one's abilities without worrying about whether course work can translate directly into a salable product. However, part-time jobs, particularly ones directly related to one's field of study, are very important to expose students, even if only partially, to the work world that awaits them after graduation. 
Should all students have a part-time job? The answer to this question is subjective?it depends on the student. A blanket, yes-or-no answer would overlook the various relevant factors in a studentÅfs life that are different from case to case. These factors include, but are not limited to: the need for income (for tuition, school supplies, living expenses, etc.), the probable impact on the studentÅfs available time and energy level (and the resulting reduction of their effectiveness in studying and completing assignments), as well as the relevance of the job in question to their field of study. Considerations pertaining to the first of these factors are fairly straightforward?the student either requires additional income to support their education, or they do not. The importance of a job rises and falls in relation to the level of this need. The second factor, by nature, would never increase the importance of having a job, but could increase the importance of not having one. If the demands of a job are too great (relative to the ability of the student to cope with them in addition to their scholastic responsibilities), then they should not keep the job. The last factor is the most complicated. It requires a determination on the part of the student as to whether or not they stand to gain any professional benefit from a particular job. For example, working in a convenience store would be of little use to an engineering student, but may be of some educational value to someone studying business management. Each student must weigh these factors and decide whether a part-time job is important or not based on the particulars of their own situation. 
I believe it is important for college students to have part-time jobs.  The main reason I feel this way is that it allows students to start building a strong work ethic.  It is a difficult transition entering the work force as an adult after college.  And part-time jobs provide valuable experience to help ease this transition.  Young people must study not only academic subjects but also must learn social and financial lessons to be successful in life. Having a part-time job also helps students to become financially independent of their parents.  They can use the extra money to start saving and also to enjoy their free time more. Having a job also provides students with structure so they can learn how to divide their time to be successful in all areas of life. While working, students can make valuable business contacts to help them get a full-time job after they graduate.  The best part-time job then would be one in a field in which the student intends to pursue a career. However, the demands of a job, even a part-time one, can be exhausting.  So students must not let their jobs interfere with their academic studies.  If a part-time job becomes time-consuming or stressful they must keep their priorities straight.  If necessary they should quit their jobs rather than sacrifice their academic success. Despite the risks though, I believe having a part-time job as a college student is beneficial and important. 
To say, that it is important for college students to have a part-time job, is to imply that it is important for them all to work. Many students need to support themselves through college by working, but for some it just to earn a little extra pocket money. Some students should have as little distractions as possible, for example those studying their final years of medicine.    For three reasons it can however be a useful life lesson. Firstly it gives students a chance to experience the world of work before they enter into it. They can get a taste of what is to come, or what might be if they don't manage to secure a graduate position.  They also learn what it means to earn money for themselves rather than relying on their parents or support from organisations.  Perhaps this may teach some the true value of money and working. Lastly, it allows them to explore the world lying beyond the college gates. They get to work with people outside of their immediate social circles and meet new people and friends.   The opportunities that work offers should also be considered against the student's college work load. Too much work may hinder their performance. Not having enough money for books would also be a hindrance.   I myself worked my way through university. It didn't really get in the way until the last weeks of my final year, when my workload was huge and having to leave it to go and work was not productive. Therefore I conclude now, as I did then, that the student needs to weigh up the benefits and costs of taking on extra work.   
To a certain extent I agree with the idea of college students having part-time jobs. I understand that for some of them it is a matter of necessity. Not every family can afford maintaining their son or daughter to entirely dedicate him or herself to the studies; moreover, the costs of studying in a college are getting higher and higher by the year. Nevertheless, this period is extreme important for maturing the future professional and a part-time job not directly related to the course could consume part of the momentum and energy that could preciously be used for their graduation.  There are innumerous cases of students working so hard during their so-called part-time jobs that once they are back to their classrooms they lack the necessary power to concentrate and take an active role on the learning process. The extra time (when thereÅfs some!) is used only for resting, and the students see themselves acquiring knowledge exclusively from their poor participation on their colleges, with no time dedicated to their books.  A solution could be more scholarships from the government or at least a system that would allow students get only part-time jobs that could help them put the theories they are learning from their books and classrooms into practice. 
In comparison to those who do not go to college, young adults tend to, but not always of course, work in jobs that do not require as much education or specialisation than those of their college counterparts. Generally, non college students have to adapt from school life to work in a relatively short time but this is less of a problem, since this change is more manageable as the work concerned is usually less sophisticated.  This is not the case with college or university students. By working part time whilst furthering their studies, they are able to gain a valuable insight about assimilation into the workforce. This bridging effect better enables them to adapt quickly in their leap from education to the workforce.   Working part time teaches them valuable practical lessons about life and employment that theory based universities and colleges cannot be expected to. College and university graduatesÅf jobs are likely to be more sophisticated and as such, I believe working part time is a valuable experience for such students. It teaches them about budgeting, work ethics, workplace relationships, time management, productivity and so on in a practical manner and can help universities and colleges focus less on these issues and instead concentrate on the core course material for their respective field. 
We hope that students always have their studies as their principle concern. But, of course that's not always the case. If you are a full-time college student, then by definition you are not a full-time worker. So it follows that many may have money problems. Some are perhaps fully supported by organisations or by their families and have no need of extra income. Others, perhaps older, have saved money before their courses began. But many will fall somewhere in between and need to earn a little bit of book or pocket money.   So, some students need money and so they get a part time job. However, what other benefits does working hold for students? It allows them to escape from the confines of the campus. To explore new worlds beyond the hard study that has brought them so far. They are young adults now and can explore all the adult world has to offer. Working part-time allows them to dip their toes into the unfathomable waters that hold the world of work, before they become fully immersed. Thereby preparing them for a world they will have to traverse for the rest of their lives.   Wages from gainful employment hold another benefit. They offer the ability to sample the delights of the adult world. We may want students to study hard, but they want to try out things that were previously unavailable to them.  The experiences that part-time work offers are going to help young people to become fully rounded people. They will know more of life outside the academic world and they will know a little of what money can get you and what it takes to earn it. They will hopefully appreciate it if they are paying for the next round of drinks. 
Students should very definitely work while in college, the harder the job the better. They should learn to suffer. Suffering is important. And it won't kill them.  Part time jobs are often really hard work. But too many college students don't know that hard work can be fun.  Jobs available to students are mostly basic jobs, doing simple tasks. Learning to do basic and simple tasks is an important part of education.  And it's important to have the experience, to know that hard work and suffering and doing menial labor isn't fatal.  But timing is important, too.   Students who work in Japan are different from students who work in America. Most students in Japan don't pay their own tuition, books, rent, food, or fees, and they don't usually get married while in school. So, where students in America work their way through school, students in Japan generally work to get money for a little more freedom.  In the sophomore year, studying is more important. So most sophomores should focus on studying, and not work at part time jobs. But by the 4th year, it's important to work, to round out an education. If not a part time job, then participation in a service organization can also teach these important lessons.  It is very important for students to work.  
I disagree with this statement for the following three reasons. The first reason is that a college studentÅfs prime purpose in life is to study.  They should spend all their available time learning new things.  This is the best use of their time. Cleaning toilets or serving burgers is a real waste of a college education.  Secondly, I also think that they donÅft really learn anything that useful from working a part time job.  Some people argue that they learn a lot from working while studying.  I disagree. Maybe they learn how to serve someone in a restaurant or clean some dishes but that pales in comparison with learning international law or advanced mechanical engineering. Students should be focused on learning difficult things that they canÅft teach themselves.  Thirdly, I truly believe that the only reason why some students have to have part time jobs is that the cost of education is too high. If it was made more affordable then poor students who are smart, hard working or gifted could get a full and proper education. It would be better for the colleges to reduce their fees and allow the students to spend more time studying rather than working.  I am against the statement because I firmly believe that students should be encouraged to study hard and reach their full potential rather than waste their time doing meaningless, unchallenging and pointless part time jobs. 
College is an important opportunity for anyone fortunate enough to be able to attend.  Not everyone is able to go to college and college students must use the time they have wisely to learn as much as they can before moving on in life.  It is for this reason that students should refrain from working a part-time job while in school. There are many benefits to having a part-time job, earning your own money, expanding your circle of friends, etc.  But more than that, having a job takes time.  And as any college student knows, time is their most precious commodity. Consider an average part-time job, working 20 hours, 5 days a week.  Getting ready for work and driving there and back can easily take an extra hour each day.  That's 25 hours of study time lost per week. There is also a high risk a part-time job will cause stress.  College is stressful enough without the added frustration of a job.  Maintaining friendly relationships with coworkers is bound to take up even more time. So while it may be tempting to take a part-time job for the extra money it offers, students should be urged to focus on their studies instead.  They will have to enter the work force soon enough after they graduate. 
I believe it is very important for college students to get a part-time job.  First of all, during oneÅfs college years, the transition from being a dependent child to an independent adult is rapidly underway.  Quite often, the students have moved away from home and must take responsibility for many aspects of their lives, ranging from getting up and going to bed, to making sure their homework is completed on time.  And for those living outside of university dormitories, preparing breakfast, lunch and dinner is also entirely up to them.  And, even if the students are still living with their parents while in college, they never-the-less are trying to build an identity for themselves and taking on many of the responsibilities IÅfve mentioned.  I admit this may seem like a lot to handle for a person in their late teens or early twenties.  And I also understand that adding a part-time job on top of all of this may appear to provide an unnecessary burden, but the contrary is true.  By adding a job to the aforementioned list of responsibilities, the students gain the added benefit of remuneration.  As such, the personal satisfaction of gaining financial independence in life is enormous, and the added self-esteem can manifest itself in improved performance in school and a growing sense of securing their place in the world.  And of course, it makes dating much easier, since they donÅft have to ask their parents for money. 
I completely agree with this statement for the following reasons. Firstly, so many university students do not study in Japan. They view university as one big party and completely waste their time going out, drinking and joining social clubs and the like. So I think that if they are not going to study then at the least they should work. Maybe they will appreciate their educational opportunity more when they are washing dishes in a restaurant.  My second reason is that working while studying can create great learning experiences. In Australia I studied a business degree at the University of Technology Sydney. There were 8,000 students. 75% were studying part time while working full time. They learned so much more because they knew how the real world really worked. In Australia many big companies hire university students part time also, in order to test out their character. It is a positive thing. My final point is that if Japanese students have part time jobs then they help pay for the cost of their education. This indirectly makes it cheaper on taxpayers and their parents. It makes the student better appreciate the cost of their education. This will make them study harder.   So in summary I agree with the idea that Japanese students should have part time jobs. Overall I believe that it is very positive for both the student and the economy.  
I think I agree that it is important for college students to have part time jobs. College students often find it all too easy to hide from the real world, and part time work should help them stay attached. Moreover, part time jobs can provide a backdrop of experience against which the knowledge of lots of bare facts which they obtain at school can be converted into a level of wisdom, preparing them to function in the broader society.  There are some classes in some departments where students need to focus strictly on their subjects, but such classes are not very common. More often, part time jobs give students a break from their studies -- a chance to let their subconscious processes work on the information they get in class. Part time jobs will usually help concentration more than hinder it.  Part time jobs can provide students with social connections they can't get from pure class work and association with fellow students and faculty. Such connections can enrich the lives of those whose career will ultimately remain with one company, and can provide a network to help those who end up needing to change companies. Student jobs can also provide a work record and references to help them get their first job after school.  A part time job related to the individual student's coursework can help the student see practical applications of the course material. Practical background helps the student obtain a real foundation for understanding the principles he or she is studying.  But even when a particular part time job is not related to the specific subject being studied, or the field the student eventually wants to enter, it still provides more background of actual experience. Real-world jobs help students mature into functioning adult members of society. 
I agree that itÅfs important for college students to have a part-time job. First, it instils a better sense of discipline and responsibility because it requires students to fulfill the expectations of their job and abide by the rules of the workplace. For example, the simple job of filing correspondence will teach the student the importance of being organized and attentive to details. It will help them realize that co-workers rely on the efficient performance of even small tasks, and this will motivate the student to be diligent and to take responsibility for the quality of their work. Part-time working students will also learn the value of financial discipline at an earlier age. Second, a part-time job broadens interest and opens a wider array of career possibilities for students who have yet a clear idea of what they want to do after college. Actual work experience will help the student determine what kind of job he likes or dislikes and which managerial skills he can build on (finance or human resources?). For example, a student who interns at an advertising agency may discover that he has an aptitude for graphic design or copywriting. Such hands-on experience provides a richer basis for planning a career than waiting around for any available job offer after graduation. Lastly, a part-time job during college is good preparation for the rigors and dynamics of the workplace. Usually, most of the new graduates enter their first jobs with little confidence and are too ÅggreenÅh to understand workplace relationships. Part-time work experience will familiarize the student of how office hierarchies work and where they can situate themselves as a newcomer. TheyÅfll have a better idea of where to put their skills to good use, and what kind of people they can go to for guidance and mentoring.
   I believe it is a bad idea for college students to have part-time jobs. There are two reasons why I believe this.    The first reason is college students have many responsibilities just as students. Attending classes, doing homework, writing essays and reports are just some of the demands that they have to meet. Having a part-time job on the side takes away the studentÅfs time to focus on what they should be doing which is studying. This can lead to less study time, because the time the student would normally use to study would be taken up by the time needed at the part-time job. This could, in turn, lead to lack of sleep essential for learning, since he or she would have to make up the time to study later when they should actually be sleeping.    Along with studying, what is also important is participation in clubs since many of the clubs in college are career-oriented. By choosing the club that is related to their major, they can get the experience they need later in their field when they graduate and get a job in that field of study. All clubs have secretary, manager, and treasurer positions found in many jobs as well. Taking the manager position, for instance, will give them the leadership skills they would need later if they plan to become a manager of a company or a branch. Working as a treasurer, gives them experience working with money as well as experience planning their clubÅfs budget for the year.      IÅfd like to conclude by saying that rather than getting part-time jobs outside of college, students should focus on their lives inside college by joining clubs and concentrating on their studies. 
I agree with the fact that young students should get a part time job so they can learn the value of money at an early age, on the other hand working from a young age can lead to loss of interest in other genuine activities that young people should be engaging in . Such as learning to play an instrument, sports or simply hang out with a good friend and developing crucial relationships. There is also the danger of ending up with a materialistic inclined personality and with diminished possibilities of understating our true nature as human beings. Having a part time job "which means " to start working " for the first time...it is something that we all eventually will have to  do sooner or later so in my personal opinion it is best not to rush it .  All our lives are concentrated and focused around our work since its our source of income which allow us be a part of the system.   and it is also one of the main causes of human unhappiness working for earning instead of working for the love of doing something . Working for the sole purpose of making a few bucks can be a distraction and further cloud one's understanding of the tricky monetary enslavement system we live under. That is why that short span between childhood and working life should be increased in order to assure more mental stability to the individual  
I really believe that thereÅfs time for studying and thereÅfs time for working. Every student should be able to dedicate him or herself entirely to his or her graduation. No deviation should be allowed. For this reason, I am absolutely against any part-time job executed by any student under any conditions.  Studying is the most important time in anyoneÅfs life. The result of this period can influence and sometimes determine someoneÅfs fate. Depending on the quality of the studies and the effort made by the student, the result can easily change the destiny of the entire future family and, in some cases, for generations. The damage can be irreversible.  A bad qualified professional can also mean poor quality and productivity causing lost for companies and, in the end, for the entire nation. Even the environment can suffer; result direct from possible wastes during the production.  For all the reasons above mentioned, the government and the institutions responsible for the education should make it first priority on their agendas. No excuses for any delay or lack of action on this area can be accepted. Every student should have the right for a good quality education and be assured the necessary conditions for a perfect self-improvement.  
Part-time job has done more good things for college students in Japan. It is a worthwhile experience that most college students must go through. It serves as an important element during the preparatory stage ? college education ? for the young Japanese to become productive members of the society.  Japan is perhaps one country in Asia whereby college students ? generally ? feel obliged to become financially self-supporting. They engage in part-time job to earn, save and augment their financial needs. This whole practice of having a part-time job instils discipline, responsibility, and independence among the youth.  On the one hand, having a part-time job enables students to earn money, support his/her needs, and save for the future; and, it promotes value for money among college students. On the other hand, the tasks and duties assigned to them teach important virtues such as hard-work, teamwork, and respect for authority and even the value for customers.  Although part-time job is important for college students, the parents and authorities ? schools and local governments ? must be proactive in providing guidance and setting up the appropriate policy measures to avoid some pitfalls including exploitation and abuse of the students, excessive working hours, and absenteeism and gross negligence of their schooling.  The main purposes of college students are to: i) attain the right competency ? knowledge, skills and attitude ? of their desired expertise; and, ii) finish their college education. However, let us also not lose sight of the potential gains that can be learned outside the four corners of the classroom. Thus, what is necessary is for students to find the right balance between their studies and part-time work. They should make the most out of their college life. 
In my opinion, it is not necessarily important for college students to have a part job but it may be beneficial. There are many points that that could be made for either side of the argument, but in the end unless finances are a major concern, then the decision of whether a college student takes on a part time job or not is up to the individual. Some benefits that may come from a part time job are the attainment of work experience and the development of organizational and social skills. Such skills are necessary for success both in the future workplace of the students and socially.   While the range of part time jobs available to current students may consist mainly of fast food or manual labor positions, finding a job related to oneÅfs area of study would provide invaluable experience and insight into a studentÅfs targeted career.  Even if they are unable to obtain a job related to their area of study or to their desired future career, any type of job should help in the development of the studentÅfs organizational and social skills. Balancing work schedules with class schedules, managing their income and arranging time for studying and social activities should help improve a studentÅfs time management, financial planning and effective study skills. Such skills will show immediate benefits as they should assist the individual in becoming a more productive student.   In conclusion, working a part time job may not be financially necessary for many students, but the opportunity to obtain skills and experience that will assist them in their daily lives both presently and in the future, as well as help prepare them for car post graduation careers is one that should not be passed up. 
I strongly agree that it is important for college students to have a part time job.   Firstly, part time work related to their field of study can be extremely useful to the student in gaining work experience that will be very useful to the student after they finish college. Potential employers will be impressed at interviews and the students will have more knowledge of their work before they start post college full time jobs.  Secondly, students who come to cities from country areas to study at college, and those from lower socio-economic backgrounds often need to partly or fully support their living expenses and tuition while at college. It is far better that they work part time, complete their college education, than if they do not, as they will be able to contribute more to their society professionally and financially as an educated professional. They will also be contributing further to the society through their productive employment and the money they will be able to spend as necessary in the local economy.  Thirdly, part time jobs will give young people useful experience of the responsibilities, work ethic and people skills necessary to build successful workplace relationships once they enter full time employment. People who have experience in the workplace while at college will be much better prepared for the challenges of full time work after college ends.   For these reasons, I believe having a part time job while at college very important for college students.  
    I believe it is important for college students to have a part-time job because it teaches responsibility and it helps students to develop stronger social skills.       When a student has a part time job, she must learn to be on time, appropriately dressed, and ready to work hard to do the job right.  If she is not able to do these things, there are real consequences to her actions.  She may lose some of her pay, or even lose her job.  It is better for her to practice these skills in a part-time job during college than to wait until after graduation to make naive mistakes  in a job that is critical for her future career.      Another important point in favor of part-time jobs is that they give students an opportunity to meet a  wider variety of people.  Most young people only really know other young people from their school and their family.  For many college students, the situation is the same.  They know  their classmates, teachers, and family, but maybe not too many others.  Having a part-time job in college may be  the  first chance for students to learn to work together as a team with people who are very different from them in age, ability, or way of thinking about the world.  This environment is much closer to what they will experience as adults.      All people when they enter the work force need to be able to manage themselves and to  get along with their co-workers.  It is my belief that part-time jobs give students valuable training in how to do this well. 
I agree with this statement. I believe that parents and universities should recognize this need for the good of society as a whole.   For some college students it is necessary to have a part time job for financial reasons. It is important that universities consider this fact when setting course work, and should try to be flexible with lectures, meetings and such. Otherwise students from poorer families will be at a disadvantage compared to those whose parents can support them through university.  I believe, however, that it is important not only for poor college students, but for all college students to work. It is common for people from wealthy families to pass through school, then university, and into high positions in society without ever experiencing regular work. Such people do not have empathy for the majority of workers because they have never been in such positions themselves. This situation is common in modern society, not only in companies, but also in politics, medicine, law and the academic world.   In the interests of social balance and justice I believe all college students should spend some time working in regular jobs. Universities could award credits to students who do volunteer work, or who have part time jobs in areas relevant to their subject of study. These things are important to the all-round development of the students, and therefore should count towards their degrees.  
 I agree that college students should have a part time job in college.  School is expensive, food is costly and there are many other things that students need money for.  There are many students that have a part time job while in college.  The jobs that students are doing are jobs like working in a convenience store, working in a restaurant, or other jobs assisting busy professionals.    There are some students that donÅft need a part time job during college because they have ways of getting money from either their parents or other sources.  The students who donÅft have a part time job might have an advantage because they have more time to spend on their studies however I doubt they use all their extra time studying.  There is a lot of time in college spent on developing a personÅfs many interests as a way of growing up and figuring out what is personally important.  Although the usual part time jobs are good, there should also be more available jobs in the form of internships in the studentÅfs related field of study.  The actual experience of the job provides a very valuable form of education and students can also gain first hand experience to decide if that profession is truly right for them, while also earning money.  Time is valuable and it would be nice if college education was more aware that the only reason students are studying is so they can get a job.  Jobs can also serve as a way to speed up the process of education so that people can get certified and receive their degree faster.  People can also then have means to raise their children and get an education instead of having to choose between having a family or a successful career.   
I agree it is important for college students to have a part-time job.    In Australia, most students have their first part-time job when they are high school students.  This is mainly for two reasons.  Firstly, a part time job allows them to save money, and gain a small amount of independence from their parents.  Secondly, it allows them to interact with their local community and teaches them various Åepeople-skillsÅf that will useful in later life, both personally and in their careers.  I had my first part-time job when I was 14 years old, working for a few hours a week at a local pharmacy.  I think college students are more than capable of managing a part-time job.  It teaches them many valuable things from an early age such as: an appreciation of the effort required to earn a living; building social skills outside the home and school by interacting with the public on an individual basis; building their individual personality, confidence and independence; and learning how to juggle both working and doing study at the same time.     I was very surprised to discover when I first came to Japan how few students had part-time jobs while they were studying.  Many people also believe that a student can bring more maturity and experience to their studies if they are currently working part-time while at college.  Otherwise, their study is just purely academic.  Hence, it is my opinion that it is not only important for college students to have a part-time job, but beneficial as well.    
I think it is important for college students to have part-time jobs.  The following are my list of reasons.  1. Students learn many interesting things when they are in college.  This is well and good.  However, there is no replacement for real world job experience.  Even if students only work a few hours per week they are gaining invaluable knowledge about business.  2. Even if parents are wealthy, it is a good idea for their children to learn about making money.  If everything is given to a student and they only study during college they will get out with little idea of what the real world is like.    3. If possible students should find a part time job that relates to their field of study.  Sometimes these part time jobs may not have a salary but having such a job on a resume is very helpful.  4. A part time job can help students to make money and gain confidence in their abilities.  Many of the skills they learn in their part jobs will be useful for future employment.  5. Having a part time job can be a great way for students to meet new friends and mentors while they are making money.  These are my reasons that support my belief that students in college should have part time jobs.    Thank you.   
I strongly agree with this statement, I will explain in these following three reasons.  Reason one,  I believe a part time job is necessary to be able to survive in this day and age. With the cost of living as expensive as it is. ItÅfs often a struggle for many students with the continual increase of being a student. Reason two, As a college student it is an excellent time to enjoy the college life with the long length of vacation. This time can be well used to work to save money to enjoy daily life. Which could be greatly wasted and I think some students perhaps become very lazy and unproductive during the long vacation times. Or on the other hand work a few nights a week to help pay for travel which I think is an important part of a young persons growth and becoming a well rounded person in todayÅfs society and often multicultural cities. Reason three, In some cases well off students may not have the need to work a part time job to survive. But, I strongly believe that working a part time job while studying is necessary for development of time management skills. Balancing going to classes, study, social life and work will benefit students in the future. In conclusion the benefits and life skills that students get from working far out ways that of not working. 
I agree with the statement ÅeIt is important for college students to have a part-time job.Åf  By working part time, college students develop their personal and employability skills.   If students find work in the same field/industry that they are studying they will be able to experience first hand how their studies will help with their future employment.  Having a part-time job will give the student a sample of what it is like in the ÅerealÅf workplace.  Some students may even find they are not suited to the industry they have chosen to study.  This gives them a chance to look at a different career path. The workplace may be able to assist students with their homework/assignments.  At the same time, students may be able to have valuable input into their workplace, based on what they have learned at college.   In the workplace the students will be able to develop a variety of workplace skills such as using their initiative, problem solving, communication, teamwork, customer service and interpersonal skills.  All these skills are invaluable on a resume.   Students working part-time also develop their personal skills.  They will have the responsibly of getting to work on time, being organized with their uniforms etc.  Being in a workplace will help young people to mature and become responsible adults.  Of course working part-time brings financial independence.  Being financially independent, students are not relying on their parents.  Students also learn to budget, an essential life skill. It should be pointed out that students should not have so much part-time work that they do not have time to complete their studies.  There must be a balance. 
It is important for college students to have a part-time job.  Part-time jobs provide real-world experience which can complement one's studies.  This experience may translate to job opportunities after graduation or not; however, the experience of working itself and the added insight into the reality of the working world will always be personally beneficial.  Also, all jobs will provide some extra spending money which will certainly be welcome.  The best choice would be to look for work which complements one's studies.  Often times, looking for work within a lab or as a research assistant to a professor can lead to a well-paying and conveniently located part-time job.  Such a job would also greatly enrich the content of lectures, giving a student the chance to put into practice some of the theory learned in class.  However, it is not always possible to find such a position.  A research job may not even be desirable if a student is not that interested in his studies (although, this scenario leads to certain existentially themed questions).  Regardless, one can still profit from any other form of part-time work.  For example, learning to manage time and prioritize tasks effectively are invaluable skills which can be developed simply by taking on some extra work after school.  
The opinion, that it is important for college student to have a part-time job, has some merit. There are several reasons why this is a good idea.    Firstly, a college education is a significant expense for a college student and their family. Many families do not have the capital to pay the full cost of a college education and thereby have to cover the tuition by taking out a bank loan and in some cases even mortgaging their house or business. This puts a significant amount of strain on the family finances. Therefore, if college students can assist their families with financing, they should. Even if they donÅft earn enough to help with college tuition, a part-time job can help them pay for all personal expenses or study materials, thereby, reducing the pressure on their parents and encouraging them to become independent, mature adults.    Secondly, a significant reason for all young people, including college students, to have part-time jobs is because it is great for the economy. In many countries, including Japan, a large percentage of shoppers are young people. They are the first to take notice of changes in fashion and technology and they often want to buy the latest products, thereby reviving the economy.   In addition, when college student are working at local shops their labor cost is low, so shop owners can pass these savings onto the customer. This final point is most important to me.  
College students are usually at a stage in their lives where they have the ability to learn many things. It seems like these days work ethics is a big issue. If college students had part time jobs and could understand how to work with others and carry out various task to accomplish a goal at work, this could be rewarding for their character and personal growth not to mention learning or understanding something new. Basic work ethics are learned through part time jobs. Having a part time job in college will teach the student discipline and give them an understanding of money and how it is earned. Looking to the future and seeing more college students with credit cards gives more reasons to be concerned. If parents of the students pay for everything the students will not have a sense to payback what they have borrowed from the credit cards. This will carry over into everyday life and will show irresponsible students and eventually breakdown the economic system which is happing today. Students must learn the value of money and how it is earned, to do this they must spend time working and not spend more than they have earned. Using credit cards is a false sense of money and the credit card companies are constantly pushing students to use cards, therefore, students spend more than they earn without having to get a part time job and rely on their parents to take care of the bill. If credit cards were banned from campus more students would understand the value of money and have to get part time jobs.
I agree with the above statement for a number of reasons. The most important reason however, is that I believe that anyone who goes to work, even part time, will better learn the value and responsibility of money and how hard people have to work to get it. By working a part time job, students will better understand and appreciate what a good education costs these days. Many students I knew in University didnÅft pay a dime of their University tuitions and only worked during their summer vacations. I myself had to work full time in the summers and part time through the rest of the school year in order to save enough for my tuition and daily living expenses. Furthermore, that experience of having to balance my studies, work schedule, finances and social life all at the same time, has benefit me every day since. I strongly believe that it allowed to do better in the job I got after graduating as IÅfd already experienced a lot of the requirements of actually having a job while still a student. Some of my co-workers who had not did not do so wellÅc A part time job, a full time job or any job for that matter can only be seen as a positive life experience for any young college student. 
I think it is important for college students to work while they are in school.  The reasons are 1) young people will get a sense of the real world, 2) employers look for extra-curricular activities before hiring and 3) students do better in school when they are busy. First, on the issue of the real world; students are in a bubble when going to school. They have no expectations, no one is managing their time or assignments and when and if they get a job after leaving college, they will have a head start in creating a career without some of the failures of people that have never worked.   A students that has realistic expectations, will have a much easier time adjusting to his future life of work / life balance, which is essential for companies to have employees that wont burn out early in their career. Secondly, if students work while in college, many employers especially in Japan realize that the best way to gauge a studentÅfs effectiveness is by assessing their ability to multi-task.  Many employers know, grade point averages are not on the concern of most students, so employers have devised a kind of formula based on seeing a student outside of his school environment.  The employer feels that if a student is focused on only school, and excels, they may be a poor candidate for employment.  A well rounded student is much preferred over someone that can complete an assignment.  A student must be able to work with others and a job in college is the perfect test.   Finally, students and people in general do better when their time is limited.  Idle minds can lead to unproductive students.  If someone can work and pass their classes, the student deserves a job in real life.   
It is very important for college students to have part-time jobs. Part-time jobs provide much needed income for needy students and families who face financial difficulties. Incomes from such jobs help students not only buy food and basic necessities, they also help students purchase books and educational materials they would otherwise not be able to afford.  Part-time jobs also help students  appreciate the value of money; students come to realize that earning money demands hard work, dedication and discipline. This will change their attitude towards spending, and especially towards unreasonable spending. Additionally, part- time jobs assist  students to recognize the inherent social hierarchies in the work force. These structures that exist in the work force are very different from what students experience at school. Early appreciation of the levels and hierarchies will help students understand the work environment much better when they start formal full-time jobs, and thereby adjust to the expectations faster and easier.  Finally, part-time jobs demand involvement in society; they provide effective preparation for transition from the academic world to the real world.  There is no doubt that part-time jobs provide students with invaluable experiences. Both private and public companies should do their utmost to offer part-time jobs to students. 
I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. When I think back on my days as a college student in New Zealand, it would have been difficult to  do several things without money.  I had several part-time jobs that enabled me to have continued with my tertiary studies, to pay my monthly rent for housing and to enjoy various social activities.  In New Zealand, it is common for teenagers after graduating from high school and then going onto university to move out of the family home and to spread their wings and become independent. Ultimately, the main reasons are, freedom to do whatever you wanted, hang out with friends and to prove to your parents that you were able to take care of yourself. Naturally, we need money to cover university fees, rent and daily living expenses including entertainment.    I was fortunate to receive a government sponsored student loan for the next 3 years, which covered all my tertiary fees and educational materials.  However, there wasnÅft enough money left to pay for rent or living expenses.  During my time at university, I worked part-time as a gas station attendant, kitchen hand, video rental clerk, parking attendant, several times as a waiter and finally as a hotel porter.  Working through a variety of jobs provided me with skills that are important for life.  I developed better communicative social skills working with different people, how to organize my finances more efficiently with living expenses and a sense of responsibility related to either work or my private life. 
I agree with this opinion. I have three opinions. First, a part-time job in their field of study would be beneficial. Students would be able to gain hands on experience in the industry. This experience can contribute student opinions outside of the textbook. Working in the industry could help determine if the student selected the appropriate field. All study programs do not offer internships where students have the opportunity to obtain hands on experience. Therefore,  seeking a part-time job related to their studies could be very rewarding. Second, many students are unsure and undecided of their future. The opportunity to experience working in their field of study could be quite helpful in choosing the direction of their future. A part-time job in an unrelated field of study could discover new interests and offer more options for a brighter future. Third, an appropriate part-time job could inspire students to excel in their current field of studies. Most students are not diligent until their senior years. Work experience could offer a point of view from the real world which is often difficult to comprehend from a textbook. Based on the above reasons, I support the opinion. This is to encourage students to not waste time in discovering the direction of their future. 
I agree that it is important for college students to have a part time job. There are many reasons why. IÅfll give three.  Firstly, the experience gained from working to earn money and learning to manage the money one has made is a lesson that will last a lifetime.  Even if their parents are helping with the tuition and they are only working to make their own spending money, they will learn to use their money more wisely since they had to spend time and effort to receive the money they are using. Students that are taken care of by their parents too much may lead to unmotivated workers that quit easily. There is no sadder story than that of a student that has finished 16 years of education without ever working a day in their life, only to run back home to their parents and live at home after college because of difficulties on their first job. Secondly, working part time may lead a student to finding skills they are good at but had never used before. A part time job may lead to a change in their major or it may change the studentÅfs idea of what they want to do for the rest of their life. A part time job can challenge a student to do something that they would not have tried just taking classes on campus.  Finally, the people skills developed will help in any job, especially dealing with a boss and coworkers. Those people skills may also be good references or contacts for future work. 
I agree with this statement for various reasons. The first reason is because studying costs a lot of money and it should not just be the job of the parents to pay for all of our education. Parents work very hard and pay for education right through until we leave university. Doing a part-time job also shows our parents that we are mature and responsible. Also, when we enter college, we are no longer children and so we should take it upon ourselves to find part-time work in order to help with the costs. I also believe that when we reach college age we should be taught the value of money and doing a part time job helps us realize this. College should be a special time in our lives when we learn not only from books but from the people around us. Learning from people and colleagues where we work enables college students to grow up quicker and learn about Åglife.Åh Finally, doing a part-time job helps us realize what job we might want to do when we graduate. Those experiences could also show us what jobs we donÅft want to do when we leave college. I think it is important to have a part time job that you can learn many things while doing it. Parents should encourage their kids to get jobs as soon as they reach the correct age.
There are a number of reasons why I believe college students should have a part-time job. Firstly, students need to learn the value of money. Throughout their time at school they are fully dependent on their parents and grandparents for all their financial needs.  Many youngsters growing up in todayÅfs consumerist society may have little concept of the real value of money. They are given their own cell phones funded by their parents and are always in possession of the latest games and clothes. When they want something new, in most cases they only have to ask. Having a part-time job, and earning a wage allows students a degree of financial independence and the chance to learn to both save money, and spend wisely. Secondly, having a part-time job allows students to develop practical skills, for example communicating with a variety of age groups, teamwork, dealing with problems, business etiquette, and using formal spoken language. These are skills which students may have studied about, but not had a chance to put into practice. Thirdly, students in a part-time job can gain valuable experience in their chosen (future) field of employment. For example, if they wish to become a teacher, they can work part-time in a nursery school, or cram school. If they wish to work in tourism, they can work at hotels or as local tour guides at weekends. The current employment market for graduates is very challenging, with many companies receiving thousands of applications for each position. Having prior work experience may be the key to securing a good job. In addition, students can develop professional contacts, leading to opportunities of full-time employment in the same organization upon graduation. For these reasons, I believe that having a part-time job is very important for students.
All college students should have a part-time job. There are many excellent reasons to join the work force while still attending school. For some students, the extra money will assist them in obtaining needed books and materials for study. Others will benefit from the discipline and time-management skills gained in balancing a study schedule with a semi-regular work regimen. Students who spend time away from the oppressive, thought-controlling atmosphere of most large universities will meet people accustomed to living and thinking in freedom. It can come as a welcome shock to the cloistered student to learn such a fascinating world exists, where the recommended norms of contemporary university thought patterns not only do not apply, they are mocked as absurd.  As well, occupying oneself with an outside activity such as work restricts the amount of time available to fall in with bad company or develop social habits deleterious to academic achievement. Said activities include extended periods of video game playing during school hours, lounging on oneÅfs sofa watching daytime television, indulging in repeated bouts of binge drinking with equally dissolute friends, and an obsessive devotion to online fleshpots promising sexual release in exchange for money. The individual whose day is split between class and workplace has no opportunity to sample temptation. It therefore behooves all students to arrange for part-time employment as soon as possible. The alternative does not bear mentioning. 
I do support the idea of college students working part-time, or even full-time for that matter for the following reasons. To begin, I believe by working it teaches students many valuable lessons about life that will also be a part of his/her educational process. One of those lessons to learn is about the value of money. Most kids of college age do not fully understand the value of money, as they have been given almost everything they have, without any REAL knowledge of the costs. Nor do they understand all the efforts someone had to make to pay for those things.   Another good life-lesson that working provides is having a better understanding of responsibility. Being responsible for some, or all of the costs of oneÅfs education will hopefully tie-in with understanding the value of money; in addition, for having responsibility for oneÅfs own success, as well as failure. Depending on our own disciplines to achieve success is one of the greatest assets a person can have to obtain control of oneÅfs desires. Too often young people depend on others to see to it that their lives are on the right track.   This, in my opinion is unfortunate because if we are so spoiled and have things done for us, or have everything paid for us without any effort, I believe we do not acquire the much-needed respect for people, time, money, or responsibility, not to mention many other aspects of being responsible for oneÅfs self that were not mentioned in these opinions. 
College is a transitional time from dependence to independence for most people in modern society. I think it is important for college students to have a part time job, and I shall support my claim with three points. Firstly, on the domestic front, a young person generally leaves the security of the family unit at this time in his life and begins to strike out on his own. Part time work during a course-load at college will begin to encourage thoughts of pecuniary insight and financial responsibility. Secondly, a college student needs to be able to afford school supplies, and to be able to support his changing interests, be they hobbies, extra-curricular activities, or simply entertainment. Finally, as he begins to assert his independence, a college student will likely begin to explore thoughts of starting his own family. Whether or not he will actually go so far as to do so of course will vary from person to person. However, dating, courting and generally meeting viable people with whom to explore these possibilities will likely manifest themselves during this transitional time. Independent means of supporting these activities is essential in order to become a responsible, contributing member of society. For the reasons stated above, I believe that a college student needs the experience of part-time work.
I agree with this opinion. College students are generally fresh out of high school and in most cases have had no direct experience in the work force. Taking a part-time job will give them the opportunity to learn important responsibilities for life, things that they would not be able to learn in their schools or at home from their family. Such skills as keeping to a firm work schedule, managing their finances as well as working for superiors are all good life-skill enhancements. Searching for a job is also a valuable skill that will benefit them for life. Such things as filling out a resume, going to a job interview, experiencing the joys of finding a job as well as the pain of being rejected are all useful and beneficial lessons. Another important factor to consider is learning to work in cooperation with others. Having to take a low and humble position until youÅfve put in your time is an experience all workers must go through and getting it early in life will only serve to make one stronger. In addition, the added income will perhaps help relieve their parents of the very high expense of funding their college education. ItÅfs good for everyone involved.
Yes, I emphatically support this life style and for several reasons. Firstly, these are individuals who are entering into adulthood and if they do not understand that giving back to society, in some form of work, is an indispensable part of what it means to be a (valuable) member of this society, then I would highly recommend that they start to learn.  The college years provide an opportune time for the young men or women to learn to balance their social, work and school worlds in to what will make up THEIR interpretation of life. In summary, school is a wonderful opportunity for one to build their academic skills and yet what meaning have these if they are not applied to the real world? Some would say that a part-time job is not a place where too many skills are learned or applied (what skills exactly does one get for working at Dairy Queens on the weekends?). Well, skills such as money handling, balancing their own accounts, the management of time, dealing with people all add up to becoming a responsible individual.  With freedom comes responsibility and this is something which cannot be taught in school. And so, this is why I firmly support college students working. 
I agree that is indeed important for college students to have a part-time job, for several reasons.  First, having a part-time job helps teach students how to use their time wisely.  20 hours per week working, by definition, reduces study time by 20 hours.  Thus, students begin to learn the value of using time wisely.  On a personal note, I worked on and off throughout college.  Interestingly, I got better grades when I had a part-time job.  I focused better, exercised greater discipline and worked harder in the available study time that I had.    Secondly, having a part-time helps defray the ever-increasing tuition costs.  Many college students rely on loans to help afford college.  After college debt creates stress and burdens that newly minted graduates could well live without.  Reducing (or in some cases eliminating) loans reduce debt, leaving the graduates in a better financial and mental state.  Finally, part-time jobs often expose students to the greater population at large.  Working in a restaurant, for instance, brings students in contact from those of all walks of life.  Whether learning from fellow employees or the myriad of customers, learning takes placeÅcwhich is why students go to college in the first place, isnÅft it? 
I couldnÅft agree more! I look around me today and I am really quite shocked at how easy college students have it. Most people now in college have never really wanted for anything and are used to everything being done for them. They all seem to have perfected one skill in particular: going to their parents and begging for, if not outright demanding, that they shell out outrageous amounts of cash for whatever it is that these spoiled students want to spend it on. ThereÅfs really nothing wrong with going on ski trips, traveling to see the world and enjoying your hobbies as a student. If anything, I wish I could of done these things in my student days. My point is that youÅfre far less likely to appreciate these things for their real value if you didnÅft have to earn money to pay your own way first, and second, youÅfll also probably not be able to appreciate the efforts of those who are earning those dollars, namely your parents. By the time students are old enough to go to college, itÅfs my opinion that theyÅfre also old enough to understand the value of money, and consequently, learn to respect work and the work of others though getting their own part-time job. 
I agree with this statement for two reasons.  Firstly there is the issue of finance.  Attending tertiary educational institutes puts a large expense on the cost of the student household if they are staying at home and even more if they choose to live outside of parental accommodation, the rent of which is largely financed by parents or guardians.  The cost of education, support, materials, and general living expenses is an enormous sum which in most cases needs to be subsidized by a third party, namely the government and loan institutes.  Even then, the income is rarely adequate enough and therefore students should look to part-time jobs in order to balance expenditure and ease the pressure on their parents or guardians.  The income may be low for the students, yet it yields a double bonus with respect to the money they actually earn, and the money they save from not spending while working. Secondly, it is important to consider the character-building aspect that part-time work influences on students.  In order to prepare for the Åereal worldÅf is it necessary for younger adults to engage in the same activities as household earners.  Doing this prepares them for their future professions in terms of commitment, diligence, and hard work.  It can be said that the balance of part-time work and full-time study causes stress, however upon leaving their studies and beginning their chosen career they may experience a great relief due to a lower workload.  This relief can help ease the transition to their professional life which has been shown to be traumatizing for some. 
I totally agree with this statement for the following two reasons: First, getting a part-time job is part of learning how to become independent and second, working part-time gives young students their first taste of freedom. My first reason is pretty straightforward, itÅfs when you have your first job that you first experience dealing with a boss (even though dealing with a teacher has similarities to this), dealing with co-workers (though there again classmates are kind of the same thing) but also, dealing with money and handling customers. To do well in school we essentially need to show up, sit quietly and study. In most jobs we have to think on our feet and get immediate and spontaneous feedback form the customers if we are not doing well or arenÅft moving fast enough. This dimension, having to perform tasks well in a limited time, is somewhat lacking from our schooling, so is the training in interpersonal relationships that is so important in the workplace. My second reason has to do with the fact that students will for probably the first time be earning their own money, that they can spend anyway they want. I still remember my first paycheck and the impression of power that it gave me: I could spend, and spend it on whatever I whatever I wanted! It also seemed that choosing what I what I spent my money on, that peculiar sort of freedom, also made me a lot more cautious and less apt to waste moneyÅc Yet another good reason for getting a part-time job I guess! 
It is not important for college students to have a part-time job.  The primary goal of any student should be to study.  Anything beyond study, whether club membership, community service, or a part-time job, is supplementary to a student's education.  There can be several benefits to having a part-time job.  The principle benefits being that the student is able to earn some extra money and gain work experience.  Extra money is always welcome and work experience may be helpful in finding a full-time job upon graduation.  Although, if one works part-time at the local fast-food restaurant and hopes to secure a position as a computer programmer upon graduation, then burger flipping experience might not be very helpful.  On the other hand, a part-time job can also have a decidedly negative impact on studies.  For example, if a student, particularly a first-year student, is already stretched thin by the requirements of college-level courses, then in no way is a part-time job beneficial.  Students must be able to focus on their studies and they should weigh carefully the impact of extra-curricular activities on their academic performance.  If there is negligible negative impact, then a part-time job or any other extra-curricular activity should be fine.  In the end, working a part-time job while studying full-time can be a positive or negative factor and the decision to take-up part-time work should be left solely at students' discretion.  
There is merit to the opinion that college students should have part-time jobs. However it is important not to overlook the main purpose of a college education. The main purpose is for them to sharpen their skills for the job market and put as much focus as possible on learning about their chosen field. In many cases of higher education; such as law, medicine and engineering the in-class time is supplemented by internships which are related to coursework. In this case, a large number of hours are required for lab experiments or casework. This makes it virtually impossible to consider any type of part-time job. Those who try to balance a job and a heavy course load, often do it to the detriment of their grades and their physical health. Everyone knows it is difficult to work and study at the same time. This applies to young people as well as adults. If young people must have extracurricular activities, it should be related to their studies or club or community activities. WhatÅfs more, picking up a few healthy habits, such as devoting enough time to exercising and recreational activities, is something that college life should be all about. This will improve their resumes and give them a well-rounded lifestyle before they are introduced to the tedious working world.
College is a time for most students when their mind is at its most curious stage. They are entering a new phase of life and going to a place where they will be encountering new things. At college people make life long friends and to do this they share many of the same activities, such as swimming class or chemistry experiments or even creating a new light bulb. To work a part time job would take the student away from these activities which they have already paid for. The students should spend most of their time on campus; college is not just getting a degree and moving on. It is a period in a personÅfs life that should be cherished. If a student is always going to their part time job they will miss the social ideas of college will only be able to attend classes. Being able to communicate socially as well as understanding the academics is an important stage when attending college. I feel students should live in the dormitory and take part in activities offered by the school. This is a time when the students will learn most by being exposed to group activities with their peers. Living together and sharing ideas by being part of the same dorm gives you a permanent bond for life. The student who goes to the part time job will be left behind because they won`t be able to participate in many of the college activities offered by the dorm and social groups on campus. This is a time for awareness and creating new ideas. If a student is worried about getting to the part time job and doing work there it will take away from the main ideas of college life.
Personally, I donÅft think that itÅfs terribly important for a college student to have a part time job. If he or she really needs the money in order to pay tuition or to get by without starving, then I would deem it important to find some kind of work. However, if finances are not an issue, I donÅft believe that itÅfs important or necessary. Perhaps there are a lot of people who think that working is a great life experience and that by working a part time job, college students will better understand the value of a dollar and the value of hard work. DonÅft you think that the 40 to 45 years of having to work after graduating is enough time to get that experience? I do. The youth of today have so many pressures as it is. I donÅft think that adding to that, the pressure of a part time job while they are trying to prepare for the rest of their lives, pass exams, fit into social clicks, avoid drugs and social rejection will make them a better person. If it is at all possible, I believe we should let the youth of today focus on their studies and let them enjoy a less complicated life before they are thrown to the working dogs for the remainder of their working lives. 
College students should not work while they are in school for several reasons.  First, it is difficult to focus, second, it takes time away from studies, and third, sometimes a part-time job can lead to other paths which are distracting to the path of a degree which was original goal. If a student decides to work part time, the student will have additional responsibilities that will deter a student from the focus.  If a student is to excel, he/she will need to put all energies into creating an environment that is conducive to a good study.  It is the first time in a young students life, the student makes decisions as open as going to class or doing homework.  Failure is a much larger possibility than in high school because at this point in a students life, the administration is treating them as an adult. Consequently, a job poses a threat.  Money is quite a distracter Secondly, time from studies is the most important element in success at school.  If a student takes on a heavy load the true determination of a students boils down to time management. Every hour is either spend studying, sleeping, going to class and having fun.  The college experience is about networking, meeting people, learning and essentially getting good grades and landing a good job in his/her field.   Finally, if a student is ideal for a position in a part time job, the employer might want to give the student additional responsibilities.  If given a choice between money and classes, many people especially early on in oneÅfs life would choose money. It is after all, the reason we are in school; to earn a degree and ultimately get a job.  College should be a time for studies not for distracting part time jobs. 
. I disagree because training is needed to do any jobs properly. Training requires time and is costly in terms of economic resources. To spend time and other resources to train a worker who is doing it on a temporary basis with no guarantee on his pursuit of the same job later in his life is a complete waste of time and resources.  Any part time job creates a distraction for the student. Students should focus on their studies. University studies lay the foundation for a successful career later in life. In certain cases a part time job may force a student to forgo a class or it may make him physically tired. Any forms of exhaustion interferes with the academic ability and ultimately the success of students. Furthermore, the concept of offering jobs to students should be weighed very carefully especially in this economic crisis, against job possibilities for other people in the general economy. There are many full time workers, middle aged people, married couples and even elderly people who are heavily in debt, severely short of any income and out of  jobs who need some income just to meet the very basic needs and to cover expenses of the daily life. Jobs should be offered to the groups who are more in need rather than students who may not be so disparate for an income.
I think it is not important for students to have a part-time job while they are in college. There are two main reasons for my opinion. They are concentration on studies and spending more time with family.  College students should concentrate more on their studies that interest them for the future.  Currently in Japan, I believe a large majority of students study and major in subjects that they will not be interested in at all after their graduation.  They tend to find employment in completely different fields or industry that are not at all related to their four years of study.  Why waste several years studying something that you are not interested in?    There are some students that have part-time jobs who eventually do dropout of college due to losing interest in their studies and having more interest in making money.  They become trapped with the image of material goods and an exciting social life with the money that they have earned versus the boring life of uninteresting study and having little money to do anything.  Communication is now an important social issue in Japan.  There have been reports in the media that the amount of time communicating together within a typical Japanese family is getting smaller and smaller. If college students have part-time jobs that are likely to be on the weekends, certainly this would have an effect.  The weekends are an opportunity when all members of a family can possibly gather together and spend time together.  
I disagree with this opinion. I have three opinions. First, most students often seek part-time jobs at entertainment establishments such as bars or nightclubs as an escape from school life. These part-time jobs could be an obvious distraction in their daily studies. Students would be more attracted to the lucrative tips instead of attending classes or study groups. Second, in extreme cases, when students are exposed to very lucrative part-time jobs such as dealing at a Las Vegas casino, they would most likely quit school. For example, students would be mesmerized at the cash potential of winning at the tables in Las Vegas. Currently, there is a nationwide boom with Texas Hold ÅeEm Poker in North America. Recently, students have been learning to become professional poker players rather than pursuing a diploma or degree. Third, Texas Hold ÅeEm Poker has become so popular that many young players have evolved from learning online. If you are skilled, with some luck, the prize money is quite rewarding. This new trend has swept North America and continues to grow larger. Playing online poker has become the new addictive drug. You have access to play 24 hours and a chance to win substantial cash prizes. This part-time job is fast becoming a full-time job for many young students. The goal is to enter a poker tournament and ultimately win the grand prize money. Based on the above reasons, I am against the opinion. This allows students an opportunity for an incomplete education.
I disagree that it is important for college students to have a part time job. Assuming that the student is diligent and studying for a career job, having to worry about finances would be added stress. If their parents are willing to invest the money to help pay the studentÅfs living expenses, hopefully the student will respond by studying hard to make his/her parents proud. It can be plainly seen that students that work part time will have less time to study as well and their focus will always be divided between the classroom and the part time job. Troubles at the part time job may cause the student to miss class or perhaps even lose complete sight of the goals that were once established when applying for college. My brother dropped out of Northeastern University in Massachusetts after double majoring in physics and history only to continue working at Disney world following a summer breakÅfs working holiday. Money is often wasted and it can take more time to graduate since taking a full load of classes and working part time can be often difficult. Also the chances for the student doing part time jobs to use their money to enjoy college life more such as partying and drinking can lead to other more serious problems. A budgeted amount of money from the studentÅfs parents could stem much of the partying funds.
I disagree with this statement because I think that college students should spend all of their time studying and not worrying about other things. When we graduate from College we will be able to work for around 40 years so I think we should concentrate 100% on school. Too many College students spend their time working and then this distracts them from doing homework or going home at a reasonable time. If we do part-time jobs then we will start to earn money. When we earn money we can buy things and go out to restaurants with our friends whenever we want. This could easily turn into a vicious circle and before we know it, the part-time work has become more important than college and studying. Students should postpone entering the Ågreal worldÅh until they graduate fully from College. There are too many distractions when we start to work part-time jobs. These experiences can only have a negative influence on young people. I think that any free time that college students may have after they have finished studying should be spent with their families. College students should be taught how to do housework and chores so when they leave home and live by themselves it wonÅft be a problem. Governments should place a ban on employers who employ people who are still in further education. 
 Advising college students to sacrifice what little available time they possess away from their studies in the pursuit of MammonÅfs glittering bounty is both wrong-headed and short-sighted. Anyone who has ever known a university or college student appreciates the focus and dedication they bring to the acquisition of a diploma. Interrupting this headlong charge for enlightenment is the work of demons, for what does it profit a man to gain extra pocket money only to lose his bursary? (Beware those who extol the virtues of labour! Their day of reckoning shall come, and that right soon!) The modern student should spend every waking hour digesting the great dollops of nourishing scholarship fed them by active and concerned teaching assistants. Without concentrated thought, how is newly coined wisdom to be dispensed and mastered. If dollar signs are dancing in the studentÅfs head, if raw cupidity corrupts his soul, if contemplating materialist purchases disturbs the studentÅfs mental growth, what point learning anything? Disrupting this evolving relationship with academic study by saddling the questing student with some menial, minimum wage drudgery, by interfering with the ceaseless cogitation that is a studentÅfs meet and proper burden within all institutions of higher learning, one embraces an obscene perversion of all that is holy and right about advanced education. Never! Again, I say never! To the carrels, where we shall make our stand for undivided attention to our studies across these, our new barricades. And let the so-called ÅgGreat WorksÅhÅ\rightly unread due to their relentless racism and misogynyÅ\be our cobblestones. Students of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your loans!
I do not think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are three reasons for this. Firstly, the years spent at university are of utmost importance. In these four years students should focus on studying. At university, students learn skills that will essentially shape their future, and assist them for the rest of their working lives. For busy students, it is important to focus all their energy and concentration on studying for and passing examinations, Many students these days work, for example at convenience stores or restaurants until late into the night, and are then often late for classes the following day, or find it difficult to stay awake in lectures. This may cause them to fall behind in their studies, or may ultimately lead to them failing courses or even being asked to quit by their professor. As Japanese society is heavily focused on academic success, anything that obstructs such should be discouraged. Secondly, not only is tertiary education a tool for success in life, it is very expensive. All parents want the best for their children, and most families save money for years to be able to put their sons or daughters through college. In some cases, only to have their dreams dashed by the lack of effort on behalf of their children. By not concentrating on their studies, students are not only hurting themselves, but also destroying what their parents have worked very hard for. Thirdly, a large percentage of Japanese college students these days work part-time in low-skilled jobs in restaurants. Being able to flip a burger is of no importance whatsoever when it comes to getting a full-time job in, for example an office.  For these reasons I do not think having a part-time job while studying is important.
Even though this idea may not pertain to Japanese college students as much as it does for students in the U.S. I will voice my opinion anyway. In most U.S. universities once a student is admitted to that particular school that is when the difficulties begin. Conversely speaking, entering most Japanese universities much of the challenges exists prior to entering any particular school. With that said, my opinion is purely based on my knowledge of attending school in the United States.  For many students taking a full-time class schedule is in itself quite time consuming. However, the time spent in classes in addition to the time commuting to and from all the classes is merely the beginning of the day. For many students, probably the majority of students the real schedule begins once they get home.  The real challenge is having ample time to fulfill even the obligatory things one has to accomplish in order to sustain a healthy existence. Yes, we spend time going to and from school, as we spend time actually in class, but there is also so much time spent doing homework that it is sometimes difficult to find time to get proper rest, or time to eat properly because so much time is required to fulfill our class assignments. For these reasons I am opposed to the idea of students taking on additional responsibilities. If too much is taken-on then everything we do may be compromised and not properly completed. I believe we should only take on what we can actually complete with excellence in mind rather than merely finishing for finishing sake.  
I believe that a college student should not be burdened with the responsibility of fiscal independence, and that none should assume that he should hold a part-time job during the course of his studies. I have three reasons to support my claim. Firstly, college is an essential part of the academically minded individualÅfs growth and development. A high-school student generally focuses his academic attention of mastering basic skills, the foremost of which is learning how to think. In college, however, he begins to explore concepts in much greater detail and depth, engaging in activities of critical thought and analysis. Balancing the mundane realities of holding a part-time job will simply distract this level of focus, and hamstring the overall efficacy of his college experience. Secondly, College is an important time in the social and sexual growth an individual, and his time not spent studying is best taken up with developing himself in these ways in order to become a stable, confident and contributing member of society in later years. Finally, part-time work generally pays very little, so the actual financial gain from such work is almost negligible. His time is much better spent in academic and social activities in order to prepare him for his future social responsibilities. Besides, there will be plenty of time after college is finished to learn how to hold down a job and manage his finances. 
I disagree with this opinion and feel that holding a part-time job during oneÅfs college days will negatively impact long term goals. In todayÅfs world obtaining a college education has become much more competitive than in times past. In our fatherÅfs and grandfatherÅfs generations a man could have less than a high school education and still find sufficient work to supply a modest income supporting a family of five, purchase a home, and allow his wife the freedom of staying home and carrying for his children. Those days are long past and with the entrance of more women into the work-force coupled with the ever increasing costs of living it has become near impossible to adequately support a small family without obtaining a minimum of a four-year degree. Should a young man or woman have to spend time during their college days holding down a part-time job this will only distract from their efforts of fully dedicating themselves to study. Achieving high marks in their courses should be the primary goal during this critical period of their education. Therefore, time devoted purely to study should be safe-guarded to the maximum and not diluted with worries or schedules associated with having to obtain and hold-down a part-time job.
LetÅfs ask ourselves, what is the ultimate purpose:  To make money? or to improve our academic skills?  I believe that the college student must concentrate on their studies.  For this reason I am against anybody working during their college days.  This is a very short 4 years in which the student can make great advances in their specialized field of research.  There will be plenty of time after graduation to work but there will never be such an opportunity to make such an in depth study free from mundane worries. The problem with working while going to school is that they will become distracted, tired and eventually lose their concentration, finally their studies will falter.  It is too much to worry about in addition to their schoolwork.  They will have long hours, late nights, standing all day with the burden of responsibilities which can wait until after college. I understand that young students are in a hurry to grow up, I feel itÅfs our social responsibility to make sure they take the time to enjoy life too. They may even be pressured into after hour meetings where drinking is involved. For these reasons I am completely against the college student taking on too much during these precious years and running the risk of becoming overwhelmed.  This is where they should be concentrating on their studies. 
Students, indeed all people, have different needs and desires.  A financially strapped student, for example, could reduce his/her reliance upon tuition loans.  I think it would behoove such a student to therefore work part-time.  That said, this same student may offer the following, valid counter-argument:  Working part-time, by its very nature, reduces my study time, and puts me at a disadvantage versus my fellow students who do not have a part-time job.  Getting high grades is of paramount importance to my future, as I wish to become a doctor.  I can tolerate future debt and will have the means to repay it.  If I work part-time now, I seriously jeopardize my future.  To coin a currently in vogue expression, ÅgI am robbing Peter to pay PaulÅh.  Thus, the importance of a part-time job during college rests with the individual student.  The onus is therefore upon this student to determine its importance.  This choice, as innumerable others, is indeed part of the learning experience. 
I donÅft really see why so many people feel it is so important for students to actually get a job. When I was growing up my parents were good enough (and enlightened enough) to pay for my education and cover all my living expenses. Perhaps I did not have a car when I was 18, nor could I really afford to go out drinking with my friends as often as I would have liked, it is nonetheless the case that because I never worked while in college I was able to truly enjoy taking my classes and focus on my studies. This approach paid off as I graduated near the top of my class and was then able to get the job I wanted (as opposed to a job that would simply allow me to pay the bills) and make a smooth start to my career. Others were not so fortunate: one of my friends from college had to pay his way (his parents could not afford to support him) and he was only able to stay in school for a little over a year before he finally dropped, suffering from exhaustion. I feel there is a lesson to be learned here and I have already started putting some money aside to put my own kids through college one day.
I disagree with this statement.  The main problem here is that of ÅetimeÅf which most students would argue they have not enough of, particularly towards the final years of their study when workloads become extremely high in volume.  There are simply not enough hours in the day for a student to attend lessons, complete all of their assignments, and then work a shift afterwards.  The expression Åehealthy body, healthy mindÅf rings true here ? how can a student be expected to perform at the necessary level required by tertiary education when they are fatigued from over-exertion, or in some cases unable to engage in physical activity because they have no time?  Generally, most students have 2 free days at the weekend in which they have availability for part-time work but this negates the entire purpose of a 5-day week which is to rest.  For those with a 6 day study week the problem is compounded and that single free day is absolutely required for relaxation purposes.    Furthermore, student life is the last chance a person may have to experience freedom in terms of responsibility.  While there is certainly responsibility to be held with regards to their study, they are rarely relied upon by anyone else as people are in professional careers.  The last few years before entering their careers is their best chance to have fun so they should be able to utilize any free time they have pursuing their recreational habits with the limited time they have.  Obliging a student to spend their free time working instead of enjoying life can have a detrimental effect on their outlook,  and may lead to feelings of frustration, depression, or even pessimism. 
I worked a part-time job throughout my college days and to be honest, I wish I hadnÅft. There are two main reasons I feel students should not have a part-time job in college: they get distracted and they develop bad habits. Indeed, students who have a part-time job (like I did) quickly change their perspective. Time becomes money and once you have money, you want more. Before long, these students end up working 30 or 40 hours a week and hardly have the time to make it to their classes, much less to study for their exams. Of my college days, I really only remember being tired all the time, I was always either working, trying to catch up on my class work (something which I ended up doing less and less), or out spending my money. And thatÅfs where I get to the part about the bad habits! First, poor sleeping habits: I was always working, studying or partying. But because I was so tired, I could never really enjoy any of it or get anything done properly! And then thereÅfs the spending: Some people say that part-time jobs teach you how to spend and budget: wrong! My friends and I spent on cars, fancy clothes, cigarettes, beer and nightclubs. When I finally did drop out of college and had to look for a real job, it seems that none of the employers I interviewed with cared much about my experience as a bartender, nor did my fancy clothes impress them. The lack of a degree certainly did not help either.
I partially disagree with this statement. To be sure, anti-smoking efforts in Japan currently lag significantly behind those of many other developed nations, and further progress in this area is to be desired. Yet a total ban on smoking in restaurants is a rather extreme solution, and would undoubtedly meet considerable resistance among the population. Currently, there are virtually no restrictions on restaurant smoking policy in Japan. Implementing a total ban on smoking at restaurants would represent the complete opposite approach to the issue. Between these polar extremes, it is, however, possible to find a middle route.  Although it is certainly advisable to urge people not to smoke, it is nonetheless their right to do so, regardless of concern for their personal health and well-being. Therefore, in considering the appropriate policy, one must balance the right of those who wish to smoke against the rights and health concerns of those who donÅft.   In many places around the world, partial restrictions on smoking (without completely banning it) have been implemented with considerable success. Restaurants and bars can be legally compelled to provide a separate, ventilated room for their smoking patrons, or alternatively (if they cannot afford such renovations), become a fully non-smoking establishment. Indeed, many establishments in Japan have already built such facilities purely on their own initiative.  Therefore, it is quite possible to find a middle ground between the current lax standards, and an outright ban on smoking in restaurants. 
I strongly believe that smoking should be banned at all restaurants. Restaurants are places where families take time to have a nice meal without exposing themselves to the risk of getting cancer, asthma and other respiratory problems. The children are the worst sufferers of the ill effects of smoking. Smoking alone kills thousands of people every year and makes hundreds of them sick. It should be banned because nowadays it seems like everywhere you go someone is always smoking. Inside the restaurants, breathing smoke causes loss of appetite and it smells bad too.  In a free society like Japan every individual has a right to choose to do what they want even if it means some harm to their own health. Nothing can justify interference in personal choice but is it justified enough that the right of an individual to smoke can affect other people's lives? However there is a moral justification to the interference of theÅ@society -to make people aware  and guide them to make the right choices, therefore the warnings and the campaigns to ban smoking are perfectly justified.  Another reason to ban smoking is passive smoking which is like inhaling a second hand smoke- breathing smoke does affect a person's health. People, who smoke, unknowingly are affecting the health of the people they even don't know. Banning smoking within the premise is a rational approach since the health of the employee is more important relative to the rights (or choices) of customers.   Many countries like UK and parts of US have already banned smoking so why not Japan, which is a health conscious country and definitely wants healthy citizens. In conclusion, I think there is a reasonable justification for banning smoking in all restaurants despite of the fact that it means infringement of the rights people. 
    I believe smoking should be banned from all restaurants. I have two reasons for this.     The first and most obvious reason is the effect that second-hand smoke has on non-smokers. Family members of those who smoke are more prone to health problems than the smokers themselves are. Keeping this in mind, non-smokers who want to go the restaurant should be allowed to enjoy a smoke-free environment without having to worry about any health problems that will occur from it. Putting aside the problem of the customers, letÅfs also keep in my mind the workers who have to work at the restaurants and potentially work there everyday. That would come to five days or more a week of unwanted exposure to smoke. They should be allowed to have a smoke-free working environment as well.     Another reason to ban smoking is that tobacco in the air has a definite effect on the food that is served there. One of the main reasons to go to a restaurant is to appreciate the food. It is hard to really enjoy the taste of food when you are inhaling smoke at the same time. The smell of the smoke becomes entangled with the food to the point where it becomes hard to tell what the food really tastes like. This canÅft be good for the customer nor can it be good for the restaurant.     For these two reasons, I believe that smoking should be banned in all restaurants. This is not to say that smoking is banned altogether. Smokers can still smoke. ItÅfs just that we have to consider the welfare and health of non-smokers in public places and that includes restaurants. 
Of course smoking tobacco should be banned in all restaurants in Japan. Tobacco smoke is a poison and has no reason being anywhere close to food, and no reason being anywhere close to where people eat or work.  Tobacco smoke permeates foods and makes it taste bad. Also, when people breathe smoke, it alters the taste of food, making it taste bad. Tobacco smoke is a habit-forming poison, and a stimulant. Many people react violently to it and become quite ill when exposed to even small amounts of smoke.   Customers can't always choose where they will eat. Maybe they have heard that a restaurant is good and decide to try it at lunch. But if the restaurant is too smoky for them to eat at, they may not have time to find another place to eat lunch that day. That's not fair.  Restaurant workers have the right to work in a healthy environment, too. If customers are allowed to smoke, someone has to go serve them. Regular exposure to second-hand smoke is as bad for the health as regular smoking. Often, a person who has to work in a smoky environment goes through withdrawal pains when his or her work environment changes. They become addicted, even if they are not themselves smoking. And working in a smoky environment makes it that much harder to quit when they decide to quit.  Exposing restaurant customers to tobacco smoke is an insult to the customer. It's also also a safety issue for the employees. If it's against the law, selfish customers won't be able to demand a place to smoke. So it should be against the law everywhere. 
I believe that smoking should be banned in all restaurants. There are so many good arguments for implementing such a policy that they cannot all be examined here.  The first, and most obvious, is that concerning the health of restaurant patrons. Principally, we must consider the potential negative health effects of second-hand smoke for those restaurant patrons who are non-smokers. They have made the wise choice to refrain from taking up smoking, and should not be forced to compromise their potential health and well-being simply because others have not made similarly wise choices regarding their own lifestyles. At the same time, we would do well to consider the effects of a smoking ban on the health of smokers, as well. These individuals cannot, of course, be forced to quit smoking entirely--as they are within their rights to smoke, if they wish to do so--but it is, nonetheless, the responsibility of the government to discourage smoking. Therefore, a smoking ban in restaurants would be good for smokers as well. It would force them to smoke less, and possibly even encourage them to give up smoking entirely. Perhaps most importantly, there is also the health of restaurant employees to be taken into account. These employees may or may not be smokers themselves, but regardless, their health is, perhaps, the most at risk of all (due to the relatively large amount of time they spend in a smoke-filled environment).   The potential benefits of this policy for the public at large cannot be ignored. In addition to the health factor itself, there would be an additional, long-term, beneficial impact on the national healthcare system as less and less people are forced to seek treatment for tobacco-related illnesses. In all, there are far more reasons for banning smoking in restaurants than there against. 
I disagree with this statement, however it's context must first be made clear. The statement can be divided into two separate arguments; firstly, is the purpose of banning smoking in restaurants to promote the comfort and health of non-smoking diners, or is it second, to reduce the total number of smokers in Japan?  Despite proven health risks, smoking is still very popular amongst all ages because it is a highly social pastime and over time, has become deeply integrated into social etiquette. With regard to both arguments, banning smoking in all restaurants will improve the comfort of non-smoking customers and may help reduce the chance of passively contracting a smoking related illness later in life, but it is perhaps too severe on customers who choose to smoke and on restaurants' business. The immediate effect of banning smoking would significantly reduce the total number of customers at restaurants and consequently damage their profits heavily. A better approach, would be to introduce smoking and non-smoking sections in restaurants, or to segregate smoking and non-smoking restaurants altogether. This would give customers the freedom to choose an environment which suits them, whilst allowing businesses to succeed financially. Finally, with regard to the second argument, reducing the number of smokers in Japan needs to be brought about gradually, by improving health education and changing social pressures, not solely by banning smoking in all restaurants.   
Smoking should be banned in all public places because of the clearly harmful effects of secondhand smoke.  Smokers often like to claim that their right to smoke is an individual right as important as the right to vote or the right to free speech, as if the act of smoking were something to be championed, as if their ancestors had endured long, violent, and bloody rebellions against oppressive rulers with the sole aim of gaining the right to light up a cigarette. No such battles took place, and anyone attempting to claim as an individual right the act of inhaling a drug with unquestionably harmful consequences to one's body has a strange conception of the rights of human beings.  Furthermore, due to its harmful effects on society as a whole, smoking doesnÅft qualify as an individual right. Friends talking and laughing over cigarettes in restaurants share smiles while they spread increased risk to cancer to all those in range of the smoke pouring from their mouths. Air filtering machines can do little to prevent the immediate risk of inhaling a nearby diner's second-hand smoke. Partitions serve as mere window dressing.  Even if all of the risks to those other than the smoker could be removed, society still carries financial responsibility for the smoker's health. If the smoker is enrolled in a national or group health plan, the smoker's increased rate of sickness and risk of acquiring serious diseases like cancer lead to an enormous financial consequence for society as a whole. Society also shares the responsibility for providing financial support for any dependents of a smoker, or for the disposal of the smoker's corpse once the smoker succumbs to disease. For this reason society has every right to limit the rights of individuals that adversely affect society as a whole. 
Smoking should not be banned in all restaurants in Japan. This would be an infringement on the freedoms of both Japanese citizens and restaurant proprietors. It is true that smoking cigarettes is bad for a personÅfs health, yet this point is irrelevant from a business perspective. Citizens are free to make their own decision about whether or not to smoke, and likewise, are free to choose which restaurants they wish to dine at. Restaurant owners are not obligated to allow their patrons to smoke in their establishments, and should not be so. By the same token, they should not be obliged to forbid smoking, either.  As long as both citizens and firms are given the freedom to make their own decisions regarding smoking policy (whether it be personal policy or business policy), then both smokers and non-smokers alike can obtain a dining experience that is suitable to them. Inevitably, while many restaurants will choose to provide a smoking section, many will also opt not to. Market forces will dictate the number of firms choosing each course of action. Indeed, this is already true in Japan today? not all restaurants are uniformly smoking or non-smoking. Rather, they choose the policy that best suits their market. This way, all customers can be satisfied simply by choosing a restaurant that has the policy of their choice. If the government wishes to reduce the number of smokers in Japan, it has many policy options available to it. Raising tobacco taxes, for example, would be a far more effective way of discouraging Japanese citizens from smoking. If policies such as this were utilized, and the number of smokers thereby decreased, then market forces would, in turn, push firms to adopt non-smoking policies in their establishments, without the need for direct government interference.  
I support the banning of smoking in all restaurants.  This is a difficult issue since both banning and allowing smoking infringe upon people's rights to an extent.  Banning smoking prevents people from engaging in an activity that is legal in other locations.  But allowing smoking poses a health risk to the general public. The current situation in many restaurants is a compromise.  Smoking is allowed, but only in specially designated areas.  This compromise, while well-intentioned, simply doesn't work.  Even with an air-tight barrier between sections, opening the door to the smoking section releases large amounts of smoke into the non-smoking section.  A restaurant would have to go to great lengths, using large, expensive fans, for example, to provide a smoking room that truly keeps the smoke in.  In reality the vast majority of restaurants make no attempt to provide such a barrier and couldn't afford to if they wanted to.  At worst a low wall or nothing at all separates the sections.  Obviously being seated on the edge of the non-smoking section next to a concentrated group of smokers would be completely unacceptable to someone with a respiratory condition, for example, or a pregnant woman. To a non-smoker having to smell and breathe smoke can be anything from mildly annoying to dangerous.  And since a compromise involving separate sections isn't really feasible, I support the banning of smoking in all restaurants. 
Smoking will be banned in all eating and drinking establishments in Japan. ItÅfs just a matter of time.   The tide of change started along time ago. Admittedly that tide started as a ripple on the other side of the mighty Pacific Ocean. But itÅfs building into a tsunami that will sweep the whole world. I remember reading about those crazy California health freaks banning smoking in public places at least ten years ago. I sighed when I read it, thinking to myself that people should be allowed to do as they please.  Brash loud Americans going on about their right to breath, or rather not breathe second hand smoke. It seemed so extreme. Rude and inconsiderate to the smokers.   Years passed.   I stopped smoking and it felt normal to be surrounded by smoke whenever I went to the pub or sat too near the smoking section in restaurants. It was however, not exactly a flavour enhancer.   Then, three years ago, Ireland, the land that is sold around the world as a land of smoke filled pubs, banned smoking in restaurants and pubs! Scotland then the rest of the UK. Now even Holland has followed. The tide has changed and the anti smoke tsunami is now rolling across Europe towards Asia,  What effect did this have? Not much pubs are just as busy, but much more pleasant. Special covered smoking areas are located outside, with heaters for the cold winter months. Smokers have got used to it and admit that the environment is a lot more pleasant and the food tastes a lot better. So smokers have learned to adjust, businesses are not affected and they are a nicer place.  This tsunami is not bringing destruction but sweeping away the dirty, unhealthy habits of old. Eventually it will reach Japan. 
I entirely agree with this point of view; furthermore, I support the idea of a complete ban of smoking at any public space.  It is scientifically proved the harm smoking can cause not only to smokers but also to second-hand smokers. For a long period, it was thought that the governments would benefit from all the taxes collected from its sales. On the contrary, after all the cancer and stroke cases revealed through innumerous researches, itÅfs proved that, in the long term, such benefits are eclipsed by the cost over the public health system.  The ban should be enforced specially on the restaurants for one simple reason: it also disturbs one of the most important senses used while eating ? the smell. ItÅfs easy to see how much more pleasure one can enjoy from a more colorful and tasty meal without the horrible interference of the tobacco.  It is notorious how the exposure to the chemicals contained in the smoke can risk our health. Therefore, a total ban of smoking in public spaces should not only be limited to the restaurants. Why restrict the benefits to one place? LetÅfs not forget all the parks, town squares, streets, stations and so on. In addition, this measure would help smokers to quit and discourage others from starting this deadly habit.  
Despite what we now know about smoking and that it is still one of the leading causes of death in Japan, many people still smoke and begin smoking which seems strange in this day and age.  Smoking has and is currently being phased out in many western nations for the following reasons. It is known that passive smoking can injuriously affect and contribute to those people who donÅft smoke but are surrounded by those that do, such as restaurant, bar and nightclub staff. This is reason enough to enforce such a ban. The effect of second hand smoking is amplified if you are a child, pregnant woman or elderly citizen. In addition to the obvious health affects, second hand smoke can irritate eyes and introduce an unfavourable smell to the premises.  Should someone wish to smoke whilst enjoying a meal, there could be an arrangement whereby the restaurant provides a smoking room or cubicle such as those seen at large public buildings and airports. In other scenarios, the smoker could go outside for a quick cigarette when he or she feels the need. From my own personal experience, restaurants and bars that have brought in substantial smoking bans in my own country, the air quality drastically improves, creating a much more pleasant atmosphere. The absence of smoke felt like an energy boost as breathing was much easier. Until this, I had never realised how energy sapping having a haze of cigarette smoke could be.  By gradually reducing the choice of places where smokers can light up, it may also assist in subconsciously persuading the smoker to finally beat this dangerous habit. I believe that smoking should be completely banned in restaurants.  
Japan has been embroiled in a bitter sweet love affair with tobacco for centuries. Despite the bitter after-taste the country doesn't look ready to allow the evil weed to loosen its grip. A grip which often seems tightest in the smoke filled atmosphere of the countries famous eateries and izakaya's.   Calls to ban smoking from these places seem ridiculous when examined against the apparent universal acceptance of smokers indulging their mistress in such establishments. It could be argued, that some of these places even appear to favour the smokers over non-smokers. I have never been in an izakaya that had a non-smoking section. I have, however, been in restaurants where you can sit Ågsmoke freeÅh. These places are often right beside the smoking areas, understandable in a country of limited space and high property prices. But, there is often no attempt to stop the smoke from drifting wherever it pleases. If the owners were more concerned about pleasing the rest of us smoke ventilation would be much more prevalent.   Perhaps change may be on the horizon, thanks to another force that Japan has a love hate relationship with, America. Although major US chains have been allowed to embrace the Japanese for far less time than cigarettes their influence is strong and all persuasive. Take Starbucks, for example, a new boy on the block, who successfully operates hundreds of shops across Japan while telling their customers to take their smoking outside. McDonald's, while not banning smoking, has started to introduce little glass boxes which imprison smokers and their fumes for all to see.   It may take sometime for Japanese owned establishments to follow suit. Not while they view pleasing smokers as more important than pleasing everyone else.  
People who smoke in restaurants should get the death penalty.   Okay, maybe not the death penalty, but this is not a little thing. It's really quite a big problem, and it's a problem of manners.  Smoking may be important to some people, but, before they smoke, they should ask permission of the people around them. And if people don't want them to smoke around them, they shouldn't smoke there.   This is especially true in public restaurants, where people eat. We want people to take things into their bodies that will be nutritive, and we want them to enjoy eating nutritious food. It's hard to enjoy food when the flavor is mixed with tobacco smoke, and it's harder for the body to get the nutrition from the food when breathing smoke.  Mothers, in particular, should be careful not to take too much sugar or too much that is spicy. And they should definitely not take poisons into their bodies. Things like tobacco, coffee, and alcohol contain poisons. Poisons aren't good for anyone.  I want people to remember when they were infants. They were dependent on their mothers for their nutrition. Their mothers made great sacrifices to give them their bodies, so they should treat their bodies with great respect.  Also they should not want to cause other people to dirty up their bodies. They should not want to pollute the environment and cause other people to take poisons and unclean things into their bodies.  There should be no reason for people to want to smoke in restaurants. Making it against the law would help people realize this.  
I completely and absolutely agree with this statement. Firstly, second hand smoke kills.  I personally am extremely angry when someone selfishly smokes next to me in a restaurant.  I want to ask them why they are trying to kill me with their smoke.  If you want to kill yourself then smoke at home and do it in private.  Restaurant staff should not have to die from second hand smoke while working nor should customers having a meal. People who smoke in restaurants should be arrested for attempted murder, especially if there are young children around. Secondly, you cannot enjoy your meal.  It is a known fact that smell and taste go together.  If you cannot smell then you cannot taste.  It is also known that smoke deadens your sense of smell.  I like nothing better than smelling a hot plate of Carbonara or a sizzling t-bone steak before I eat it.  Smelling my food is sometimes better than eating it. When someone smokes next to you in a restaurant they spoil your eating experience. Lastly, smoking in restaurants makes the place stink.  I like my restaurants to be spotlessly clean.  No one likes to eat food prepared in a dirty place.  What is dirtier than smoke and ash? Nothing.  Smoking is one of the dirtiest things on earth.  It has no place in a restaurant. Smoking is dirty and restaurants should be clean and that is why they should be banned. So for these three reasons I am completely for totally banning smoking in every restaurant in Japan, sooner rather than later. 
Smoking is a tough issue for most businesses and the government to deal with.  There are strong opinions on both sides of the matter.  But the government has made its decision.  Smoking tobacco is legal.  And while many people may not like it, everyone needs to learn to live with things they don't like in order to be a part of society.  Therefore I would not support a ban of smoking in all restaurants. I may not like hearing the conversation of two people next to me in a train car, or even walking down the street, but I can't ban them from talking. Tobacco smoke can be more than just an annoyance though.  To people with breathing problems or certain respiratory conditions, it can be quite harmful to breathe large amounts of any kind of smoke.  So restaurants and other public gathering places should provide separate special smoking areas. As long as the government requires separate smoking and non-smoking areas in restaurants, everyone should be satisfied.  Some restaurants may complain or have trouble affording to build separate areas, but this is no different than requiring them to adhere to other food quality and hygiene standards, which can also be costly. So as long as restaurants are able to provide separate smoking and non-smoking areas, there is no reason to ban smoking in all restaurants. 
There is no doubt in my mind that smoking should be banned entirely in all restaurants in Japan.  Honestly, I almost find it difficult that people are still asking this question because the hazards of cigarette smoke have been well known for many years, not only by consumers and doctors, but most especially, the tobacco companies themselves.  The toxicity of second-hand tobacco smoke is said to be almost as high as a carÅfs exhaust.  Is it reasonable to ask people to eat their breakfast, lunch or dinner in a parking garage with a car revving its engine?  Of course not, and it should be very much the same with restaurants not allowing their paying customers to be subjected to the equally toxic and stinky fumes from cigarettes.    Certainly I recognize that smokers will feel bad about not being able to enjoy a cigarette while dining out with friends, but I also donÅft see how any reasonable person can try to compare a smokerÅfs Åghurt feelingsÅh with the clinically verifiable hazards associated with second-hand tobacco smoke.  Since it is absolutely ridiculous to equate a smoker feeling discriminated against, with their imposing a statistically quantifiable increase in a number of health problems upon other non-smoking patrons, smoking patrons and of course, the staff, I will pull no punches when I say, smoking should be banned in all restaurants in Japan!  
I totally disagree with this statement because I am a smoker.  I think there should be a balance. Smokers and non-smokers can live in harmony. There should be smoking and non-smoking restaurants. Why can't there be both? It makes perfect sense to me. Non smokers don't have to go to restaurants that allow smoking.  My second point is that most restaurants have separate sections for smokers and non smokers, often on different floors! For a long time smokers and non smokers have been living in harmony. So why change anything? If the current segregation of restaurants is working and people are happy then let's keep it that way.  Lastly, my question is what will all the smokers do if they can't smoke in restaurants? All that will happen is that the smokers will stand out the front of the restaurants and smoke. This will make the sidewalks dirtier and more crowded. Tokyo sidewalks are already too crowded. Imagine what they would be like if millions of smokers were standing outside all the restaurants. It would be terrible. So let the smokers stay inside.  So in conclusion I believe that smokers should be allowed to stay in restaurants. It makes perfect sense to me. 
I would like to be able to agree with this because tobacco is poisonous to everyone. But, even though it is particularly poisonous to me, I can't fully agree.   I like to hang out after work with my co-workers, but someone invariably starts smoking. Breathing the smoke for a long time makes it  difficult for me to work the next day, and sometimes much longer.   Speaking of work, I have had to give up a few jobs because of  smoking in the workplace. It was hard for me to ask my employers to ban smoking because I knew that some of my co-workers were addicted. I knew that, until they could learn to adjust, it was going to be difficult for them to work effectively without the regular hit. For this reason, even now, I try to put up with the occasional whiff of smoke from the smoking area at work.  I don't think people should be forced to do what is good for them. Fighting an addiction under the threat of force makes it very difficult for the addicted person to fully overcome the addiction. People who are forced to quit often resort to compensating behaviors that turn into even worse addictions.  I do appreciate completely smoke-free trains, stores, and restaurants. But some eating establishments should be allowed to cater to those people who still think they need a place to relax with a cigarette.   I also think it would ultimately be more effective to instead raise the tax on tobacco enough to encourage smokers to cut back or quit without making them feel forced to do so.  
I agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in Japan.  The primary reason for this is consideration for non-smokers and their health, especially those with asthma or allergies.  These are people who are more susceptible to the harmful effects of inhaling secondary smoke, which exacerbates asthma and allergy symptoms. They should not be involuntarily subjected to conditions where smokers pollute the environment, particularly in public places where you have to pay to be served.  The secondary reason is consideration for children and the elderly who dine at restaurants.  They, too, should not have to eat their meals in such conditions because their health is more fragile.  Also, the smell of cigarette smoke sticks to oneÅfs clothing and belongings ? whether he smokes or not ? and is difficult to remove.  This may be a minor issue but it is unfair that one has to suffer from such inconvenience just because a public place freely accommodates smokers.  Smokers have the right to enjoy their cigarettes, as it is a personal choice.  But they have to acknowledge that by smoking in a public place like restaurants, they not only make the air unclean, but also encroach on the rights of others; namely, that of enjoying their meal in a public space which presents no hazard to their health.  Even if smokers are aware of the negative effects of smoking on their own health, they should be considerate of their surroundings and the hazards they present when other people inhale secondary smoke.  
There are three reasons why smoking should be allowed in restaurants and bars.     The first reason is the atmosphere of the restaurant. Many people go to bars and restaurants to have fun, relax. For a lot of people, smoking is one of the ways they can do this. By banning smoking, smokers wouldnÅft be able to enjoy being in the restaurant. They would have to leave every once in a while to smoke. I believe that smokers would be less inclined to go to bars and restaurants. This would lead to the second reason being business.     Many, I would say half, of the customers who go to restaurants are smokers. By banning smoking, the restaurant would in effect be cutting out half of their business. This would mean less money coming in which would then lead to lower wages for the workers there. The consequence of lowering the workerÅfs pay would be lower morale. The workers would be less inclined to create great meals. The third reason is that restaurants do not have to resort to pushing away smokers. They can easily accommodate smokers as well as non-smokers. In fact, many restaurants have done this by splitting the restaurant into a smoking and a non-smoking section. In the US, this is very common and may be so in other countries. This is a win-win situation. Non-smokers can feel comfortable smoking and non-smokers can enjoy a smoke-free environment. Restaurants would profit as well by welcoming all people to come and enjoy, regardless of whether they smoke or not. In conclusion, I think that banning smoking in restaurants would be a very bad idea. It is not the question of whether we should accommodate smokers or not, but rather a question of how we should accommodate them. 
Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Do you agree or disagree. Use reasons and specific details to support your answer I have many times found myself in uncomfortable situations where I didnÅft wish to smoke but I had to breathe the smoke coming from smoking areas in restaurants and bars. That is why I completely agree with the statement above.  Smoking should be banned in the proximity of all public areas not just restaurants.  In Europe there is already a law that prohibits smoker from smoking in clubs as well as restaurant and it is normal to see smokers step outside to smoke.  Unfortunately this is not yet a reality in Japan and every year an increasing amount of people  suffer from the diseases caused by second hand smoke .  Studies about second hand smoke speak for themselves In addition, in Japan, the tobacco industry is in part responsible for not making aware the public of the dangers of second hand smoke so that makes it even harder to have smoke free areas. Smoke free areas, it s something that I would like to see and it is something that in my opinion is necessary but is something  that is not likely to happen any time soon seeing and considering several factors like the one I discussed above  
I strongly support the idea of banning smoking not only in restaurants but also in any closed and open spaces. I donÅft really care about what people do with their own health, but once their choices interferes directly with other peopleÅfs lives, thereÅfs something wrong. AnyoneÅfs rights always finishes where the otherÅfs right begins. Therefore, one personÅfs right to enjoy him or herself in any activity must finish once it enters other peopleÅfs spaces.  You canÅft just drop garbage wherever you want. You must consider other peopleÅfs lives. It doesnÅft matter if it is in a restaurant, park or street: you just canÅft dump it! You must find a proper place. Some people misunderstand that if something is public (and they say they are part of this concept ÅgpublicÅh), they can do whatever they want. This is a common mistake. The concept of ÅgpublicÅh also implies the idea that everyone has the same rights, with the condition of respecting everyone elseÅfs rights.  Tobacco is proved to cause cancer and other serious diseases. For this reason, any person smoking not on private places is putting others peopleÅfs lives at risk. More than a simple fine, the government should consider the total prohibition of consuming tobacco. For the fact it threatens peoples lives, it should receive the status of any other drug, such as cocaine or heroin.   People canÅft continue disposing their Ågtoxic trashÅh into other peopleÅfs lungs in the name of a misused liberty and continue not considering future consequences. 
Should we endanger the life of others just to attain our personal satisfaction and happiness? Should we endanger the lives of the elderly who built the social institutions of the present and the young who are the future of Japan?   Let us completely ban smoking in restaurants so everyone can enjoy the food that we eat, the beverages that we drink, and the air that we breathe. Restaurants are public places where individuals, friends, couples, and families ? smokers and non-smokers, young and elderly, healthy and sickly ? go to take pleasure in their favourite food and drinks.  Medical science tells us that cigarette smoking is a source of health hazards not only to the smoker, but more gravely to the non-smoker inhaling second hand smokes. And smoking in restaurants exposes non-smokers to an unhealthy environment and to serious health risks ? particularly the young children, the elderly, and those with respiratory ailment whose health systems are weak.  We recognize that everyone has a right to smoke cigarettes as it is a source of oneÅfs personal satisfaction and happiness. However, this right should not infringe on the more basic human rights of others ? the right to life and a healthy environment. Non-smokers have more basic human rights to a clean air, smoke-free restaurants and public places.  Right to life is the most basic human right of humanity.  Perhaps the second basic human right is the right to a healthy environment where one can develop his/her potentials to the fullest ? intellectual, physical and spiritual.  
The topic of banning smoking in restaurants in Japan is a controversial one. However, I believe it is a necessary step in order to protect the rights of all those living in Japan, as well as relieving an unnecessary financial burden from the shoulders of Japanese tax payers.  It is a proven fact that smoking is harmful to oneÅfs health whether they are smokers themselves or just happen to be in the close vicinity of smokers. Second hand smoke is damaging and potentially deadly to those who are exposed to it. It can thus be considered an act of harmful negligence for one to smoke in the presence of others. It is because of this that the government must take appropriate measures to insure the safety of all by protecting them from second hand smoke in public venues.  In Japan the financial health burdens of one are shared partially by the many by way of the national health care system. However, when it comes to health problems that are caused directly or indirectly by smoking it becomes a question of responsibility.  This is a luxury the common tax payer and the federal government cannot afford nor should they be made to. Smokers who continue to smoke despite adequate public knowledge of the risks should be made to foot the bill for their health care. By banning public smoking in places such as restaurants the government is sending a message that smoking is no longer socially acceptable and should help encourage smokers to quit.  In conclusion banning public smoking is a necessary step not only to protect the right to venture out risk free in public of its citizens, but also to discourage smoking and therefore also protect their wallets. 
I agree that smoking should absolutely be banned at all restaurants in our country.   Firstly, the evidence is clear. There is no safe level of exposure to tobacco smoke, either through directly smoking or chewing a tobacco product, or by breathing second hand tobacco smoke exhaled by a smoker. No safe level of exposure. None. Period. The danger to the health of restaurant clients and staff is too high. Not to mention the unsuspecting children of tobacco smokers who are too young to be protected by their own educated choice. All these people should be protected from this potentially deadly risk in our restaurants.   Secondly, the counterargument that banning smoking in restaurants completely will affect the hospitality industry negatively is simply false. Such rules have been put in place in countries and major cities around the world and no downturn in restaurant revenues has been reported. In fact, increased numbers of customers have been reported in some economies.   Thirdly, the benefits of less people being exposed to tobacco smoke, especially considering JapanÅfs aging population are clear. Smoking causes cancer and heart disease. With an aging population in Japan, and medical costs expected to rise a lot in the coming years, doesnÅft it make sense to reduce exposure to such a great health risk to one hundred percent of restaurant customers? So many people will be at less risk of preventable disease. The government and the medical sector of the economy will save millions of yen and the population will be healthier and more productive physically, and economically.   For these reasons, I believe that smoking should definitely be banned in all restaurants in our country.  
Although I dislike tobacco use in all its forms and fully recognize the dangers of both first and second-hand smoking to the health of all members of society, I simply cannot support a complete smoking ban in all restaurants within this country.   Unlike a hospital or a school where people for one reason or another are compelled to be in a specific location, entering a restaurant is entirely the choice of the individual.  If the restaurant is a smoking establishment and this is not acceptable, a person has only to choose to eat elsewhere.  Tobacco is still a legal product in Japan and therefore smokers as well  as non-smokers should have the right to go to certain places where they can relax and enjoy a meal without judgment.   Furthermore, for many smokers tobacco is not a nasty habit, but rather an addiction.  Banning smoking from all restaurants will not cause people who need help to stop smoking, It will simply hide the problem further from public sight.  Such a ban has the potential to cause people to feel isolated and humiliated because of their addiction.  Successful programs like Alcoholics Anonymous show us that it is not this kind of shaming, but rather connection to others and positive support that are the keys to recovery for people struggling with overcoming addiction.  Since this ban would infringe upon personal freedoms and run counter to current beliefs on how to treat addiction, I strongly disagree with implementation of such an idea. 
I disagree with this statement. As a non-smoker who dislikes inhaling smoke, especially when I am eating, it is very tempting to support the statement. However, I recognize that by supporting the statement I would be putting my personal preferences ahead of the rights of others.   There are two groups of people who's rights would be violated by such a rule, smokers and restaurant proprietors.  Smokers have rights. I don't believe that they have the right to poison the air of non-smokers, but they do have the right to enjoy a cigarette in a restaurant If the proprietor decides to allow smoking in that restaurant. Non-smokers have the right to not enter such restaurants, therefore there should be no need for such a ban on smoking in all restaurants.  The proprietors of restaurants have the right to set the rules for their own business. This right should not violated by such an overall ban on smoking.   In the past, smoking was so popular in Japan that it was very difficult to eat a meal in a restaurant without inhaling other peoples' smoke. Now, however, smoking is becoming less popular and it is easier to find restaurants that ban smoking, or where the smoking area is well removed from the non-smoking area. This is the market at work, and it should be allowed to work without introducing such overreaching laws as the one being proposed here. 
 I agree a smoking ban is necessary in Japan.  I understand that smokers feel they have the right to smoke because they enjoy themselves, however people who do not smoke do not enjoy breathing toxic smoke and making their clothes smell bad.   I believe the decision for the government to impose a smoking bad has done a lot to improve the lives of people by helping them cut back on smoking.  The debate is very big now because the law is new and smokers who remember life before the law preferred the way things were             Public places need to protect the well-being of non-smokers however bars and restaurants should also be able to be able to offer sections to allow smokers to smoke and attract the customers who prefer places to smoke.  These sections need to be small and enclosed in an out of the way place with machines that can ventilate the smoke.   These enclosed areas need to be able to protect any smoke that might escape and drift into the realm of non-smokers.    I applaud our government in trying to protect people, however we are also live in a capitalistic society and business is also an important concern for the well being of our people.      Governments have done a noble thing in enacting the smoking ban.  The government does also need to offer alternatives that can help to accommodate smokers for the sake of business and revenue.  Business and revenue must come second to the first priority, which is the health of the innocent who do not choose to smoke.  The government must also be consistent with its laws, or else people will not take the law seriously. 
I agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in Japan.    Smoking affects the health of not only the smoker through direct inhalation, but also those around them through `passive smoking`.  Hence, smoking is harmful to both the smokers themselves, and the other customers in the restaurant who choose not to smoke.  Many restaurants have a smoking section and a non-smoking section, but in my opinion, based on what I have read in recent years, this practice is very ineffective.  From my own experience of growing up in a family where both my parents smoked from a young age, my own health as a child was severely affected by their smoking habit.  My mother smoked when she was pregnant with me, and because of that I suffered from a variety of respiratory problems; sinus, bronchitis, and whooping cough for example.  It is a vicious cycle.  My younger sister also took up smoking and while pregnant, and now her daughter suffers from asthma as well.    Whether people choose to smoke around their children and others in their own home is their prerogative.  However I believe when smokers are smoking in public, especially in restaurants, that they should be mindful to those around them and the impact that their smoking has on the health of others.  It is selfish for smokers to disregard the health of those around them in restaurants when they smoke.  For this reason, smoking has been banned in restaurants in other countries already.  I would be very happy if smoking was banned at all restaurants in Japan.   
I think that smoking should be banned in all restaurants.  The following are my list of reasons.  1. When people go to a restaurant they want a pleasant dining experience.  Even if you set aside a section for smokers everyone can still smell the bad odor.  Most restaurants do not have a special ventilation system to keep smoke in designated areas.     2. Second hand smoke is very dangerous but impossible to avoid if others are smoking.  Of course people can just go to a non-smoking restaurant but then their choices are rather limited.     3. If you go to a restaurant and there is smoking when you get home you smell like smoke.  Patrons of a restaurant should not have to change clothes and take a shower to freshen up just because someone wanted to smoke.  4. People that have quit smoking may be tempted to start again when they see other people smoking.  5. If children see adults they admire smoking in a restaurant they may think that smoking is a good thing.  Then the first chance they get they will start smoking themselves.  So I think that smoking should be banned in all restaurants as soon as possible.  Thank you. 
I strongly agree with this statement, I will explain in these following three reasons.   Reason one, with the scientific proof that smoking causes harm to those who smoke and even more so to those around them I donÅft believe smoking should even be legal. In todayÅfs society and the lengths people go to keep fit and healthy it is beyond me why some people continue to smoke.  Reason two, because of the health effects smoking has on people I think it should be the choice of each individual person to whether or not they wish to inhale. As with todayÅfs current laws they often do not. There has been an improvement in the seating arrangements in restaurants with the separation of smokers and non-smokers. Still the smell often travels around the restaurant as the ventilation is not always one hundred percent perfect. Or if for example customers must walk through the smoking area to get to the bathroom. The popular drinks bar may be situated in or right next to the designated smoking area. Reason three, the enjoyment of a restaurant experience can be greatly affected by just one smoker lighting up. Some Japanese smokers light up even before they have finished their meal. If a person is sitting at the same table or counter seating the smell while they are trying to take in the full flavor, sites and smells maybe put them off their meal. So in conclusion the health benefits and enjoyment value of not smoking at all in Japanese restaurants people would be much better off.    
I agree with the statement ÅeSmoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in JapanÅf.   It is well documented that smoking and passive smoking causes premature death.  In Japan smoking causes more deaths than all non-medical causes put together.  Diners who do not smoke should not be exposed to passive cigarette smoke.  Smokers should be encouraged to quit, as smoking related illnesses cost the health system (Japanese Government) millions of yen each year.  It has been found that Åesmoke freeÅf workplaces have reduced the consumption of cigarettes by 21%.  Banning smoking in restaurants would help to reduce the number of cigarettes a person smokes, thus taking pressure off the health system and saving the government a lot of money. Restaurant owners may argue they will lose business if they become Åenon-smokingÅf.  The Australian government banned smoking in all restaurants, cafes and other places where food is purchased some years ago.  At the time smokers and restaurant owners were opposed to this legislation.  However surveys conducted some time after the legislation was introduced found the number of diners actually increased.  Diners who had previously avoided restaurants due to a dislike of cigarette smoke began to enjoy dining out.  Both staff and diners welcomed the new legislation.  Smokers in Australia are now required to go outside to have a cigarette.  Banning smoking will create a more pleasant and safe environment for staff and as more non-smoking diners begin to dine out, restaurant owners will enjoy increased profits. 
Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country.  Second-hand smoke is a known carcinogen and detrimental to the health of all who inhale it.  To allow smoking in restaurants, or in any public space for that matter, is to wilfully allow harm to come to all those within that space - smokers and non-smokers alike.  Citizens must have the right to a safe environment in which to enjoy a meal or to work or to live.  Smoking in restaurants cannot stand if Japan is to respect the rights of its citizens.  This does not mean that Japan is to ban smoking wholesale; it remains a right in liberal societies for individuals to choose to expose themselves to risk within limits.  However, this individual right to expose oneself to risk cannot supersede the collective right to safety of all citizens within a given public space.  The freedom of individuals or groups of individuals to smoke within a non-public space, say on privately owned property, is not affected or contested.  Although some workarounds have been proposed, one cannot assume that only smokers will be present within a given public space.  Even if Japan were to mandate the use of separately ventilated smoking-rooms in order to segregate smokers and non-smokers, this would only potentially protect patrons of the restaurant.  Staff who service the smoking-rooms would still be harmed by exposure to the smoke.  To hire only smokers to service the rooms would be tantamount to promoting discriminatory hiring policies.  Asking for employee consent to work in a smoking-room would be equally unacceptable as it leads to a choice between livelihood or health.  A complete ban on smoking at all restaurants is the only way to avoid these pitfalls. 
ÅgSmoking should be banned in all restaurants in the countryÅh, is a strong but true statement. This statement shows that the government is taking an active role in the health and welfare of the community. Restaurants where smoking is allowed create a toxic environment for their customers, as well as staff members who inhale the fumes all day. It is commonly known that cigarettes cause cancer and it is well known that the damage to the lungs of secondhand smokers is often severe, if not fatal. This law will encourage smokers to smoke outside in open areas or reduce their smoking.  The average time spent in a restaurant is one hour. This is a reasonable amount of time for a smoker to smoke beforehand and refrain from smoking while in the restaurant. However If they choose to leave earlier, there will be more seats available to other customers, thus increasing the chances of profit for the restaurant owner. Smoking restrictions are one way for the government to protect itself from future lawsuits due to secondhand smoke. However, the best way to reduce the number of deaths due to smoking is a serious campaign to educate people on the direct impact cigarette smoke has on their lives and the lives of their families. This is especially true for families with children.
I realize that smoking is an unhealthy habit. I smoked for two years and quit smoking about six years ago. My body and mind became much healthier in all ways. Some of the best times to enjoy a cigarette were after a nice dinner at a restaurant and enjoying a cup of coffee. For many people smoking is a pleasure of life. I still go to my favorite restaurants but no longer crave cigarettes after a meal and I really don`t like the smell of them but to ban cigarettes in all restaurants would be extreme. Some city governments in the USA have banned smoking in their cities and I`m strongly against this. I believe it should be left up to the restaurant owner to make this decision if the owner wants to have a non smoking area or not. People should have the right to choose, no one is forcing them to go to a smoking restaurant. Banning smoking on airplanes was a good idea because the second hand smoke could linger and it is a necessity for people to travel. You donÅft have to go to a restaurant. Often, modern ventilation systems are very good. Recently I sat in the smoking area with a smoker and I didn`t notice the smoke because of the ventilation system. Giving governments more control and owners less control is the main concern I have. I believe the government should make sure restaurants serve clean food so we don`t get sick, yet this is something the consumer should be able to judge. If you see an unclean restaurant do you really want to eat there even though the government says it is alright? Some things are better left up to the consumers to decide on.
I strongly agree with the above statement for a number of obvious reasons. By now we all know the facts regarding second hand smoke and the health risk that it causes to others, especially children and babies. Smokers can no longer ignore the fact that by smoking around others, smokers or non-smokers alike, they are endangering everyoneÅfs health in that enclosed PUBLIC space. Restaurants and other enclosed public places should be accessible to anyone. By allowing people to smoke there, restaurant owners and smokers themselves are taking the rights of non smokers away. I believe that all people have the right to smoke and have no problem with that. Smokers can still smoke outside (though I do wish they were more careful about where they decided to throw out their cigarette butts!), in their homes, in their cars and in many other public areas. Many restaurants have smoking sections, but they are rarely adequately sectioned off from other areas in the restaurant and the smoke inevitably bothers other patrons. Smokers are becoming a minority with the trend for a healthier public environment on the rise, and itÅfs about time that they realized, or rather that our government made them realize, that they can no longer put other peopleÅfs health at risk for their own selfish pleasure. 
I think smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in Japan. The reasons are quite simple.  First and most important smoking is dangerous to health, secondly, second-had smoke is unfair to non-smokers and finally, smoking, particularly in restaurants is bad for the taste of food.  To talk about the biggest reason, is almost obvious, smoking is well known to cause a variety of dangerous ailments. Smoking is a habit that has caused millions of deaths over the years, and unlike other vices; even in moderation had no health benefits.  Smoking is of course a choice which leads me to my second argument.  Yes, smoking is legal and people do want to smoke but it shouldnÅft be forced on non-smokers.  Heavy smoking populated countries like Ireland, Spain and many states in the US have banned smoking in not only restaurants but all buildings. This means non-smokers, get a relief. Second-hand smoke is unhealthy and non-smokers shouldnÅft be subjected to the ill effects of smokerÅfs bad habits.  Also children entering a family friendly restaurant have no choice where their parents take them. Inhaling smoke in young lungs should never be an option.  Finally smoking is bad for food.  The taste of food is directly linked to taste and smell. If the environment is filled with smoke, food doesnÅft taste good. This is not the strongest of arguments for banning smoking in restaurants but ultimately why do people go out to eat?  To sample foods to eat in a environment that is safe, and enjoyable. Japan should ban smoking in all restaurants and soon! 
There should be total ban on smoking in all public places, including restaurants. Going to restaurants is both a pleasure and a necessary activity for many people. Why should non-smokers be subjected to second-hand smoking, to its negative effects or to its bad smell if they are in a restaurant enjoying their meals? Why should we allow their pleasure to be spoiled by the selfishness of a smoker puffing smoke into the air? Non-smokers have the same basic rights as smokers. These rights should be upheld and respected. It is a proven fact that smoking can cause various maladies; these maladies range from simple problems such as tooth cavities to a far more complicated malady such as lung cancer. We should therefore protect the right and the health of non- smokers. Protecting the non-smokers from the dangers of second-hand smoke has noticeable financial implications as well. Second- hand smoke exposes the victim to a wide range of diseases resulting from nicotine. A major part of governments' health budget is dedicated to curing smoking related diseases. Once the dangers of second hand smoking are totally abolished, there would be a noticeable decrease in diseases as well as a huge saving in governments' health budgets. It is beyond doubt that there should be a ban on smoking in restaurants.
I completely agree with the statement that smoking should be banned from all restaurants in the country. The reasons for my opinion are as follows: second hand smoke, distinctiveness of Japanese food and social etiquette. I donÅft smoke but get very irritated when someone at the next table smokes near me while IÅfm trying to enjoy my meal in a restaurant.  Alot of smokers have the habit of blowing the smoke above other peoples heads thinking that it is okay and that it wonÅft affect us. There is nothing worse than inhaling smoke and breath mixed together. The dangers of secondhand smoke have widely been covered by the media around the world.  In fact, in many countries, smoking has been completely banned in restaurants, due to the health risks associated with it.  Japan has a lot of food that is well known for its distinctiveness, foods such as sushi, tempura, sukiyaki, okonomiyaki and so on.  A lot of these foods have a unique taste and are served with a distinct sauce mainly for that particular dish.  After smoking a cigarette and then enjoying a carefully prepared dish, I personally donÅft think that you would be able to taste the full flavor of the meal.  I find smokers also tend to have bad manners when I go out with them socially.  While walking to a restaurant or bar, they tend to smoke at the same time, and just before we enter they think it is okay to throw the cigarette on the ground or the closest sewer. Some of them also smoke in front of me without asking if it is okay even while IÅfm still eating. For the above reasons, I agree 100% with the statement. 
I agree with this opinion. I have three reasons. First, all non smokers are paying customers and have the right to enjoy their meal in a smoke free environment. It is still unfair to non smokers in restaurants offering a smoking section. If the restaurant is small, you can still smell the smoke. Customers would have a hard time to enjoy the flavour and aroma of the food they are trying to eat. Second, servers could enjoy working without the dangerous effects of second hand smoke. Apparently, if a server worked ten years in a smoking environment, the probability of developing cancer is much higher than a smoker. It would be a shame to leave a workplace with a chronic disease while you were only trying to make a living. Third, restaurateurs could enjoy lower insurance premiums due to less liability from no smoking in the establishments. The probability of a fire due to a customerÅfs negligence is eliminated. Therefore, restaurateurs could have more available funds to operate or promote the establishment. This may begin a trend in other establishments such as bars and nightclubs who may also benefit from lowered insurance premiums. Based on the above reasons, I support the opinion. This is fighting for the rights of non smokers and employees of restaurants. 
I agree that smoking should be banned from all the restaurants in the country.  The largest and most undisputable reason is that smoking shortens peopleÅfs lives. It is definitely the largest cause of lung cancer in the world and is a plague on mankind. A substitute habit should be invented for people wanting to relax that will not kill them slowly while polluting the air around them.  Sanitary issues are also important to think about since smoke not only stains the smokers teeth, clothes and hair, it stains the walls and must therefore get on the plates, in the food and drinks as well. Air walls, air conditioners and curtains do not completely block out the smoke or smell from the non-smoking side of a restaurant. For some extra sensitive people it could make eating at that restaurant impossible. Safety is another reason why smoking should be banned.  Lighting fires indoor is one of the most obvious reasons for buildings to burn down, and with the potential for a cigarette butt that has not been full extinguished to find itÅfs way into the trash, onto the floor or perhaps even be doused with a flammable liquid such as Bacardi 151. Hello Mr. Molotov cocktail.  
I totally agree with this statement. Before the dangers of smoking were realized, it used to be fashionable and it was glamorized by famous people and actors in Hollywood in the 1960Åfs and even earlier. Lung cancer and other diseases caused by passive smoking are finally being directly related to smoking and secondary smoke or passive smoking. Restaurants are now family venues where children play and as a parent we should not have to worry which restaurant to go to or which one to avoid because if the possibility of smoking in the restaurant. I am a non-smoker so I donÅft want to breathe in someone elseÅfs poison just because they want to light up a cigarette inside. The hospitals in the UK are now treating many cases of cancer of smoking related diseases and it is the tax payer who has to pay for this. Why should my taxes help to pay for people who want to smoke? Not only is it an unpleasant hobby but it is also a deadly one. I do not want to be a part of those cancer statistics just because people are addicted to a filthy habit. I see smoking as a waste of time and very anti-social. Governments should take responsibility for this problem and protect the majority of the population who do not smoke. 
  Tobacco is the most insidious product ever invented. When Walter Raleigh first introduced this aromatic leaf to customers in the Olde Worlde, did he imagine the hacking horrors soon to be manifested among its gin-soaked populace? I think not. And yet there remain those among us convinced that their personal right to commit attenuated suicide includes the corresponding right to harness their innocent neighbours to iron lungs and other breathing apparatus at some distant future. Restaurants are places that promote comfortable dining among friends and family. Visiting them is a long-established social custom. But countless medical studies have shown the dangers associated with inhaling expelled tobacco smoke in close quarters. And so this question must be asked: What of the children? ItÅfs bad enough that GrannyÅfs emphysema attacks worsen with every Sunday brunch, as clouds of noxious fumes from nearby tables create a deadly nimbus of toxic pollution above those hennaed waves of hair. What of the infant, his life irremediably shortened with each contaminated breath he takes.  There are over four hundred discrete chemical agents to be found in the exhaust of a burning cigarette, each of which is capable of rendering a healthy male comatose, sufficiently dosed. Taken together, they represent an assault on the human physique worse than anything seen in the trenches of Verdun during World War I. This is more than a health issue. This is a human rights issue! Ban smoking in restaurants everywhere, around the world.  
I strongly agree with a complete ban on smoking in all restaurants throughout Japan. There are four reasons for this. Firstly, smoking is bad for health. It is now commonly accepted throughout the world that smoking is bad for health. Smoking is not only extremely detrimental to the health of the actual smoker, but more importantly it is now generally agreed that the effects of passive smoking are equally damaging. A meal in a good restaurant should be a leisurely experience, and can often last for two or three hours. Non-smokers dining in restaurants or bars should not have to endure the effects of breathing other peopleÅfs smoke for long periods. In addition, staff at restaurants work long hours, sometimes in very enclosed spaces. Being able to work in a healthy environment is a basic right. Secondly, children should not be unnecessarily exposed to the bad habits of adults. Children are a regular sight at popular restaurants throughout Japan, especially on weekends. Tobacco is not only unhealthy, but it is also an age-restricted product. Having smokers sitting at the next table sends the wrong signal to children. Thirdly, smoking affects the taste of oneÅfs food. One of the pleasures of dining out is experiencing tastes and smells of foods that one might not otherwise eat. When we ÅetasteÅf food, we are experiencing a combination of sensory signals from both the mouth and nose. The smell of cigarette smoke can change the taste of some foods. Many restaurant managers worry that banning smoking will affect business, however statistics from cities in Europe and the US reveal that there has been no significant loss of business since a blanket ban on smoking was introduced. For these reasons, I fully support a ban on smoking in restaurants. 
As for banning smoking in restaurants, I absolutely believe smoking should be banned. Furthermore, why stop with restaurants? Before I address this question I will give my reasons why I believe smoking should be banned in ALL restaurants. To begin, letÅfs start with the obvious. It has been scientifically proven that second hand smoke has enough toxins to cause lung cancer and many other diseases such as heart disease. In the very worst situations second hand smoke causes death. At the very least, simple discomfort is caused by second hand smoke. From the worst to the least there are countless reasons smoking in restaurants should be banned. Not only should it be banned, in my solicited opinion, it should be illegal. I feel there should be consequences for people who smoke and create a dangerous environment simply because they feel they have the freedom to do as they wish with their lives. I believe these incredibly selfish people lack respect for others. They feel that by not smoking is asking too much of them, as they are basically drug addicts. Everyone knows that drug addicts do not consider others when they need their drug of choice. These selfish people also have polluted ideas of what personal freedoms really are.  I do believe smokers have the right to smoke and should be permitted to smoke regardless of the medical consequences. However, I do not believe that society should not be held responsible for the medical costs caused by smoking.   Now, to address my earlier question, I believe smoking should be banned in all public areas. And I mean all public areas. Smoking should only be permitted in oneÅfs home. ThatÅfs it! They should not be permitted to smoke outside their own home. Not even in their yard. 
I believe that smoking should be banned in all restaurants throughout Japan. I have three reasons to support my position. Firstly, regarding the health of customers, more and more compelling evidence suggests that the ingestion of second-hand smoke is a direct cause of various lung disorders, predominant of which is lung cancer. Any steps that can be taken to reduce this risk should be taken by any civilized nation. Japan is by and large a socialist nation, where the good of the many is the concern of the individual; sickness and lack of public health simply undermines the health of the body-politic, which is illogical and self-defeating. Secondly, regarding the health of restaurant staff, second-hand smoke creates an unhealthy working environment. I believe that every individual has the right to work in a safe and healthy work-place. Banning smoking will remove the dangers inherent to second-hand smoke from negatively effecting employees. Finally, there is the issue of social acceptance of smoking, or rather lack thereof. A restaurant, or restaurant chain, that bans smoking on its premises sends out a message to society in general: that smoking is unacceptable in the presence of non-smokers, of whom there are more and more in the light of recent shifts in medical awareness and social health. Therefore, for these reasons, smoking should be banned in all restaurants.
I totally agree with this opinion. Recent studies have shown that second-hand smoke is a major contributor to lung cancer and other diseases associated with tobacco and the cancerous carcinogens produced from its burning. Restaurants, though privately owned, are opened to the general public. In the case of allowing smokers to freely smoke and fill the air that is commonly breathed by all customers, smokers and non-smokers alike, restaurant owners are exposing the innocent to hazardous and life-threatening conditions. It is not sufficient to merely partition off areas for smokers when the air can freely pass throughout the establishment. In addition to exposing non-smokers to the hazards of cancer causing carcinogens restaurant owners are also bringing the foul smell of smoke filled air onto the clothing and bodies of non-smoking customers. Non-smoking customers will be forced to pay cleaning costs to rid their clothing of these foul smells. Furthermore, it has been proved that nicotine contained in tobacco has addictive properties. I suppose a case could be made that restaurants which allow smoke filled air to mingle with non-smoking customers could be accused of contributing to the non-voluntary addiction to nicotine of their non-smoking cliental. Finally, there is the issue of health costs. With the national government (Japan) bearing the largest burden of health care, allowing restaurants to continue a free smoking policy will only place a larger financial burden on all citizens, i.e. increased taxes to cover these costs.  With these potential complaints and even law-suits, not to mention the financial burden associated with increased health care costs, it seems in the best interest of all to totally ban smoking in all restaurants.
Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. We must respect and take care not to bother others in order to live peacefully in this society. This is the basis for my argument for the total and complete prohibition of smoking in any public space. How can one go out and expect to enjoy oneself if he is subjected to various disturbances? Imagine that you are watching a movie at a cinema and the people in front of you start commenting on everything that happens. Would this not ruin the effect of the movie? Next, you are on a long flight and the child sitting behind you starts kicking your chair? So, how can anyone enjoy the taste of the delicious food on their lips when it is overwhelmed by the rancid taste of tobacco? You cannot have a smoking section at a restaurant, because that is like having a peeing section in a swimming pool. Smokers are decreasing as new concrete data is coming out which clearly shows the connection between cigarette smoking and various ailments. For this reason, it is my belief that this dying breed should respect all non-smokers and not subject us to the dangerous consequences of being around cigarette smoke. 
I agree with the statement above for several reasons.  First, secondhand smoke harms non-smokers.  Too many Åenon-smokingÅf sections of restaurants are arbitrarily, haphazardly designed.  In effect, smoke drifts from smoking to non-smoking sections, harming all its way.  Secondly, while customers patronize restaurants or their choice, restaurant workers are stuck in their workplace. Would ToyotaÅfs union, for instance, expose its employees to hazardous chemicals involved in automobile manufacturing? No.  As unionization in the food/service industry is practically nonexistent, the responsibility rests with government to protect its citizens.   Finally, society---both smokers and non-smokers--- pay a massive cost for second-hand smoke related illnesses.  While smokers may willingly pay such costs, non-smokers should not have to.  Second-hand smoke sickens people. The evidence is indisputable.  As people become sick, they need costly medical (hospitalization, medicine, etc..) treatments.  While all of us have an ethical duty to care for all our fellow citizens, it is unfair that non-smokers must pay for, in the form of higher insurance premiums and taxes, the care of those who make a poor lifestyle choice.  Seatbelt regulations, to the chagrin of Åefree lifestyle advocates), have long since been passed into law.  Simply, they save lives and reduce societal costs. In similar fashion, the government must take decisive action against smoking in restaurants, thereby protecting the health of those exposed and reducing the costs of healthcare. 
Two reasons why we should ban smokingÅc Let me seeÅc I remember my last trip to Paris: smoking there has effectively been banned in all restaurants and somehow life goes onÅc So how is it that even in the home of the Gitanes and the famous ÅgTabac GrisÅh, almost synonymous with French culture, the French themselves have decided to butt out? Many feel that banning smoking is an attack on personal freedomsÅc Perhaps, but states are there both to preserve freedoms and keep their citizens safe (whether it be from outside dangers or from themselves!). In this case the logic is this: smoking will undeniably damage your health (there are countless studies to prove it) and bring you no benefits (the rush that smokers get from feeding their addiction could hardly be considered  a positive thing). so we will make you stop! Safety and welfare over personal freedom, and itÅfs that simple. From there I derive my two reasons for banning smoking: I feel that banning smoking in restaurants will be good for peopleÅfs health, and this in itself should be sufficient. Secondly, and I think more importantly, a ban on smoking shows to all that we have a government that cares and functions properly and intelligently, imposing rules when its citizens are not inclined behave responsibly themselves. 
I agree with this statement for several reasons.  Smoking has been proven many times to have a large impact on the health of people, including smokers themselves and those around them.  It is absurd to allow people to inflict damage in the form of passive smoking upon others who choose not to smoke.  Each year there are numerous cases of health problems caused by second hand smoke which impacts the economy due to increased health expenditure from the government.  It is therefore necessary to take steps to reduce these issues as much as possible, and banning smoking in all restaurants is a step to achieving that.  Enclosed spaces facilitate the spread of smoke and of course restaurants are enclosed spaces yet it is not just restaurants where it should be banned ? all indoor public places should be no-smoking areas much like several countries in Europe and parts of America.   Focusing on restaurants, it is not only the health aspect we should consider.  There is also the issue of hygiene and pollution.  Smoking is a dirty habit.  The ash spreads easily, potentially contaminating food at worst, or being a mild nuisance at best.  The smoke itself has an unfavorable odor for non-smokers and smokers alike.  The smell of tobacco while eating can be enough to ruin the appetite of a 40-a-day chain-smoker let alone a non-smoker.  It is therefore in the best interests of restaurant owners to encourage the image of cleanliness in their establishments by banning smoking. 
I agree with this statement for a several reasons, perhaps not the ones you think though. Everyone already knows about the health hazards of smoking, but apart from educating the population, thereÅfs little you can do if people really want to do themselves harm (people drink too much at parties, itÅfs terrible for your health but no one is banning that!). IÅfd ban smoking in restaurants for the same reason that drinking & driving is banned: YouÅfre not only endangering yourself, youÅfre also endangering others whoÅfve made a decision not to indulge in the same risky behavior (and may not enjoy being put at risk by you!). Of course this isnÅft the only reason. IÅfm also pretty upset by the fact that smokers tend to pressure others into allowing them to smoke. I went to a cafe with a friend the other day and this friend is a smoker. Since we were only sitting down for a cup of coffee, and since my friend would have clearly found it distressing to have a cup of coffee and NOT smoke, I was persuaded to sit in the smoking section. IÅfm sure IÅfm not the only one in this situation. Essentially, the urge to smoke is very strong, stronger obviously in most cases than the urge to stay away from cigarette smoke. So in the end, itÅfs not only that smokers need to be encouraged to stop smoking, itÅfs also that non-smokers need a bit of help in saying no to their smoking friends! 
Smoking should not be completely banned at all restaurants in the country.  Smoking is a privilege, though it often seems to be mistaken for a crime.  Within a liberal and democratic society, individuals have the right to decide for themselves what is or is not acceptably harmful to their health.  They do not, however, have the right to individually choose what is acceptably harmful to others.  As such, the choice to smoke and potentially harm oneself should not affect others in a detrimental manner.  There are ways to achieve this end without the complete prohibition of smoking at Japanese restaurants.  One viable option is to mandate the use of separately ventilated smoking-rooms.  In so doing, the hazards of smoking would be effectively confined to those patrons who consent to them.  Yet, this does not address the issue of employee exposure to smoke.  A simple solution to this problem would be to hire staff who also smoke to service the smoking-rooms.  Such recruitment would not necessarily constitute a dubious hiring practice.  This would only be the case if smokers were hired exclusively for all positions or if second-hand smoke inhalation was stipulated as a work requirement for all staff.  Hiring a smoking-room waiter or waitress on the condition that they already smoke is not much different from stipulating that a motorcycle stuntman be able to ride a motorcycle.  Both jobs carry an associated risk and both require a specific qualification on the part of the candidate.  To require the respective qualifications is not discrimination, but a means to assess one's ability to accept the inherent risks.  
The statement that smoking should be banned in all restaurants is a good policy in theory, but in reality there are many people who go to restaurants to enjoy smoking and drinking while eating. Theses people make up a significant customer base for the food and beverage industry. I think that what law makers should do is pass the responsibility of protecting nonsmoking customers onto the restaurant owners. One way to do this is by charging higher taxes to restaurants with poor ventilation systems or without a barrier separation between smoking and nonsmoking sections. I believe that if the restaurant has taken reasonable steps to separate the smokers from non-smokers, then they have done their job to make sure that all customers have a comfortable dining experience. Instead of banning smoking, another way to stem the smoking vs. nonsmoking controversy is to increase in the number of non-smoking restaurants and cafes.  At this time many popular cafes, such as Starbucks have had tremendous success with promoting a smoke free environment inside the cafe. As the nonsmoking culture becomes increasingly popular, smokers will find a ways to curb their smoking appetites while dining. Overall, the best way to solve this situation is to give customers a choice. 
Recently more evidence has proven that second hand smoke can cause cancer. It is a very unhealthy feeling to enter a restaurant ready to eat a delicious healthy meal only to be disappointed by the smell of unhealthy cigarette smoke, just the smell of cigarette smoke in a restaurant makes me feel nauseas. Smoking in a closed area even if the restaurant has a no smoking area is still a problem. The smoke still lingers to the no smoking area. Some restaurants don`t have non smoking areas and after leaving the restaurant my clothes smell like cigarettes. This is not a good feeling for me. Making a law which bans smoking in restaurants is a very good idea because this would allow everybody to enjoy various foods offered in the community and also allows teenagers and children to go to the restaurants without having to breathe second hand smoke. Starbucks is a good example of a smoke free coffee shop and this image has made them very popular. Their policy is to smoke outside which I feel other restaurant should follow. Smoking these days is a very unhealthy habit and more people are against the fact of smoking than for smoking. Restaurants could have more business if they offered a smoke free environment. Most smokers crave a cigarette after a meal but which is important, a nice cooked meal in a beautiful restaurant or smoking a cigarette. I think the meal. These bans put on smoking will eventually lead people to quit because they don`t want to bother with all the hassles. As they realize that many areas now don`t allow smoking many people are inclined to cut back on the number of cigarettes they smoke, thus leading to a healthier lifestyle for smokers and non smokers alike. 
I disagree with the opinion that smoking should be completely banned from all restaurants in the country. Why do I hold such an opinion in todayÅfs age of scientific proof that so clearly shows how harmful second hand smoke is to others? First of all, I think that restaurant owners should have the same rights as home owners and be able to allow whomever they wish into their stores. If I want to allow someone to smoke in my house, I can. If you donÅft like the smoke, then you are free to leave. That same freedom should apply to the people that have paid their hard earned money to buy and set up their own business. Secondly, there are thousands of restaurants out there that cater to the many tastes, desires and needs of a very picky public. How is a restaurant that caters to the smoker crowd any different? Smoking in a public place like a bank or work office is clearly a different matter and I agree that smoking should be banned in these areas. However, restaurants are privately owned establishments and are not providing a necessary public service at a location which we must visit. This gives us the choice or the freedom to enter or not enter and gives the restaurant owners the freedom to operate their establishments as smoking, which I do believe is still legal, or non-smoking. NobodyÅfs rights are being violated as long as we all still have a choice. Banning smoking in all restaurants is clearly such a violation. 
Smoking in restaurants should be allowed for the following reasons: First, smoking is legal in Japan, second smoking and food and drinks go hand-in-hand, and third, smoking should be left to the businesses. This is a free country and the choice of smoking should be left to the employer or establishment. First and quite elementary, until smoking is illegal, we should continue to allow smoking in all restaurants.  Smokers pay high taxes on cigarettes and Japan reaps the benefits. Why take away that right. Smoking is not dangerous like drinking a driving. Smoking is a way to relax which leads into my next point. Smoking is a part of the food culture. We eat, drink and smoke. ItÅfs a package that smokers find enjoyable. Its social, it part of eating to many people.  If a non-smoker doesnÅft like it, he/she can find a non-smoking restaurant.  Let the market decide.   There are many vices in the world, but if its legal, it should be allowed. ItÅfs hypocritical for a country to allow one to buy a product but not allow one to use it?  The free market should in the end dictate how many restaurants allow smoking.  The establishment is trying to make a fair living. If smoking is banned, many smokers will choose their home or a bar to eat in and then we will be taking money away from hard working restaurant owner and the workers. In the end, if smoking is legal it should be allowed. 
Smoking must be allowed in restaurants. Smokers have the same basic rights as non-smokers; to deny smokers the right to smoke is to deny their basic human right. In addition, by denying smokers their right to smoke, we are denying them their basic needs; nicotine is addictive, and smokers need to smoke to satisfy a physical craving. So far, I donÅft think there has been any effort denying fat people entry to McDonaldÅfs restaurants, why treat the smokers this way? Society cannot dictate what is good or bad, and it cannot enforce those standards and rules on individuals. Rather, society must facilitate and accommodate the needs of all groups; smokers and non-smokers. Restaurants already provide two completely separated and insulated areas, one for smokers and one for non-smokers. Failing to recognize the needs and the rights of the two camps can be very costly for restaurants, in particular; they lose clientele from both groups. If anything, it is those who are supporting such drastic restrictions on personal freedoms who need help: societies thrive when variety and tolerance are present, they wither and fall apart without these. Clearly, restaurants are places where customers want to enjoy their time; let us make them available to both smokers and non-smokers alike. Let both smokers and non-smokers enjoy their meals.
I would disagree with the above statement for the following reasons: Loss of income for restaurant owners and the rights of smokers. If smoking was to be banned in all restaurants in Japan, it would have a major impact on many businesses which would lead to some of them closing down.  I have read that Japan has impressive statistics with the number of restaurants in the country; there is a restaurant for every group of 85 people.  Some argue that it is okay to partition off a restaurant into smoking and non-smoking areas, however a lot of restaurants are too small to be able to achieve this.  In some countries of Europe, a smoking ban was enforced in restaurants and bars.  One year later, it was widely reported that many businesses had suffered due to the ban. Without a doubt it will have the same effect here in Japan. Recently in Japan, the rights of smokers have diminished in many places around the country. JR West railways has allowed smoking at only selected areas of the platform, a city ward in Tokyo has completely banned smoking within its boundary, Midosuji Boulevard from Yodoyabashi to Honmachi is strictly non-smoking and many offices now ban smoking within the building.  If restaurants are included in this ban, IÅfm sure that many small restaurant owners in order for them to survive will turn a blind eye to their customers smoking and risk breaking the law.  
I disagree with this opinion. I have three opinions. First, if smoking is banned in all restaurants this may begin a trend in other establishments such as bars and nightclubs. Eventually retailers would follow the trend to ban smoking in shopping malls. Shoppers could also enjoy a smoke free shopping experience. Franchises and larger operations may be able to survive the decline in business. However, the small restaurateur would struggle with the lost sales from smokers. The restaurant industry would suffer not only from local business but could also lose business from tourists. Second, business tax revenue for the government would be reduced due to slow business. Small restaurateurs would be forced to close their businesses. Some would even go bankrupt by attempting to turn the business around. The government would need to offer incentives for restaurateurs to remain in business. Third, the casualty insurance industry would also profit less due to lower premiums. Many small insurance brokers serving the commercial business community would suffer from lower profits. A non smoking establishment would have zero probability of a fire due to smoking. Therefore, there would be less liability from customer negligence. Based on the above reasons, I am against the opinion. This is supporting the business community. 
I disagree that smoking should be banned from all restaurants in the country.  Firstly, it is not illegal to smoke cigarettes. These days the places allotted for cigarette smoking is being reduced all the time. Even smoking outside is banned in some areas leaving people who want a smoke with nowhere to go. Since smoking is an addiction and people are going to smoke one way or another, it is better to designate an area for people with similar tastes rather than to force them to take drastic measures. A restaurant that banned smoking would find cigarettes blocking up their bathroom toilets with the smell of smoke there as well. Since both non-smokers and smokers both use the bathroom there is a chance of losing the non-smoking patrons due to stinky bathrooms.  Secondly, smoking is one of the last good population control tools legally permitted and actually advertized. With global warming and world over population and with the advances in medical technology, if we donÅft leave a few deadly vices for people to do themselves in with, we may find ourselves going to restaurants and not finding any food left.  So build a wall, put in a glass partition and let the cool people have their smoked dinners. 
I disagree with this statement. One of the main reasons is because it creates billions of revenue for the government that can be then recycled and used to restore old buildings or some other areas of need in our cities. If smokers are not allowed to smoke in restaurants then it will stop a lot of the single people and groups of people without children from going there. They will find other places to go to and so the restaurant business and culture will be affected. Smoking brings people together and is a very sociable habit. It creates friendships and brings people together. People should be allowed to do what they like when they like as long as it doesnÅft harm others. There is no hard evidence that smoking causes lung cancer or any other diseases. It is just non-smokers who have made up this phenomenon to create controversy. I am yet to see any ÅgrealÅh evidence linking the two together. Cigarettes now have filters and are not so strong compared to before when no filters were used. People should stop complaining so much and get on with their own lives. Also, most restaurants have adequate air conditioners and so the smoke is quickly taken out of the room and therefore doesnÅft annoy any other visitors there. When you enter a restaurant it doesnÅft smell of cigarettes so that is the proof that it is not affecting the air or making the furniture smell of smoke. Smokers should be allowed their freedom to smoke where they want.
People who object to smoking in restaurants are closet totalitarians; or they are unthinking sheep only too happy to bend a knee before any other garlic-breathed madman waving a manifesto about his unkempt hair. This policy has very little to do with health and everything to do with crushing or corralling every little freedom that remains. Passive smoking is no more a danger to the average person than drinking tap water or eating fruit sprayed with pesticides. One is far more likely to be vaporized by a passing Predator drone than succumb to cancer as the result of inhaling used cigarette smoke. Indeed, studies show that nicotine, one of the more salubrious ingredients in tobacco, not only sharpens the faculties when inhaled, it helps delay the onset of senility (except among Reds, who are notoriously crazy to begin with and should be avoided at all costs). Alzheimers robs those afflicted of many years of productivity and worth to society. Anything that can forestall its hideous advance should be celebrated, not denounced by professional fear-mongers as some kind of health hazard.  Besides, as anyone who has enjoyed a fine Montecristo cigar will attest, smoking is one of the grander pleasures in life. And smoking, whether cigarette, cigar or pipe, after an expensive meal and in the company of a beautiful woman, is one of the more exquisite experiences one can have on this benighted planet. That some whingeing killjoy nearby objects to the heavenly result of lighting up a fat Cuban and taking in that rich, comforting flavour is of no consequence in the greater scheme of things. Indeed, it is entirely likely the bitter old crone complaining about those magnificent blue wreaths settling over the crockery has never enjoyed a single moment of pleasure in her entire loveless life.  
I disagree that smoking should be banned in restaurants. Firstly, a restaurant is a public place. People go there at their own choosing. It is not fair to ban smoking in restaurants while continuing to allow it in bars or nightclubs, concert halls or train stations. Secondly, many restaurants are already catering to the needs of both smokers and non-smokers. There are separate smoking sections provided, or partitioned seating, and companies have spent large sums of money on ventilation systems to remove the smoke. Restaurant owners are voluntarily doing this to satisfy both groups of customers. It is not necessary for the government to be creating more laws or restricting peopleÅfs recreational activities. Secondly, banning smoking is bad for business. Many restaurant managers and owners are already struggling to stay in business due to the current economic crisis. They feel that banning smoking will scare away valuable customers, and that it will be difficult to survive. Additionally, some do not have the space to partition separate seating, or the money to invest in expensive ventilation equipment. Thirdly, there are thousands of restaurants in every large city in Japan, catering to all tastes and varieties of cuisine. People are more than capable of selecting a restaurant that either welcomes smokers, or alternatively provides a non-smoking environment. It is a basic right to be able to smoke if one chooses, and for these reasons I do not agree with a blanket ban on smoking in restaurants.
One of the biggest reasons I believe smoking should be permitted in restaurants is because restaurants are considered places to relax. They are designed to provide an atmosphere for paying customers to come in and enjoy the freedom of having someone serve them.   Being served, not being responsible for food preparation, or cleanup are a few of the additional services we pay for when we go to a restaurant. In addition, having the freedom to enjoy a drink, or having a cigarette are added reasons why we pay to support restaurants.  If restaurants took away smoking privileges we now enjoy, in my opinion, many people would stop going to these establishments designed to encourage relaxation simply because they would be much less relaxing for smokers, and even stressful for many smokers. Banning smoking would be bad for the economy, as less and less people would want to eat out.   In addition, going to a restaurant is a personal choice, as is the freedom to smoke. If people dislike smoke for whatever reason, they do not have to frequent restaurants. They can simply create their own smoke-free environment. Nonsmokers can ban together and form a group to avoid smoky areas. For example, nonsmokers can reserve a restaurant that will only accommodate their group, free of smokers. This is one solution nonsmokers have to acquire a smoke-free environment. There are countless ways to achieve smoke free environments. But as it stands now, we have the freedom to go into any restaurant and light up if we desire. 
I believe that smoking should not be banned in restaurants in Japan for the following three reasons. Firstly, smoking is not illegal in society, so what right does an individual establishment have to ÅgrewriteÅh the rules that we all live by and accept? Certainly smoking can be frowned upon, but an outright ban borderlines on illegal. Smoking may make some people uncomfortable, much in the way that loud earphones or voluble cel-phone use on trains is irritating. However, can we ban such behaviour? Smoking is a behaviour, and restaurants do not have the right to police behaviour. Secondly, restaurants are ultimately businesses, and must serve the needs of customers in order to remain solvent. Currently, many people wish to smoke while they eat and drink, and for as long as that is the case, restaurants should provide spaces where this is possible. Certainly smoking sections are necessary in order to provide non-smokers with comfortable environments also; however, an outright ban merely seems draconian and unfair, and unworthy of a civilized democracy. Finally, there is the ÅgsnowballÅh issue: if we ban smoking due to health concerns, what will be next? Banning meat-eating if vegetarian lobbies gain the upper hand in the burgeoning health-craze? Or banning furniture made of wood if anti-forestry groups gain the upper hand? Banning smoking in restaurants is the beginning of a slippery slope, as self-interested lobbies begin to successfully steer public opinion to serve ultimately selfish, nonsensical and short-sighted goals.
I disagree with this opinion. Our freedom of choice is really whatÅfs at the basis of this argument. Are we really a free society where each individual is guaranteed the right to choose where he or she will dine or smoke? Or, must government come down to the level of infringing upon our rights and make the choice for us? Are we adults here or not? The point is that if government decides that it must interfere with our liberties to the point of deciding upon which restaurants can operate and which cannot based solely on whether smoking is banned or not, then where is the stopping place for government interference? Will they next be telling us which wash room to use, or which house to purchase? Where does the infringement on individual liberties and government intervention cease? The point is if people know full well that smoking is going on in a restaurant they would like to eat in then let them complain to the owner(s) and let the owner decide if he wants to ban smoking at his/her establishment or not. True capitalism and liberties will regulate themselves without government interference. If a business owner is losing more customers because he allows smoking then let him change his policy, and if customers donÅft like being in smoke filled restaurants then let them go elsewhere. This is what true freedom is all about; allowing for personal choices on all levels of society.
Freedom is a basic right of the individual in any civilized society. That is why I implore you to allow smoking in any and all restaurants. If they were to take away our first right after birth, to breath, then what next?  Already the society is too controlled. We cannot even talk on our cell phones on the train! I find this very strange as people are talking all around me. Why canÅft I speak with my friend miles away? We must wear seatbelts. I know this is for our own safety. And yet, how much control does the society need to place on its citizens before it stops making rules to protect us? Be in bed by 10 pm. Never walk around with chopsticks in your mouth. Cut your lawn back so that nobody strips over itÅc And on and on. there is no end and we are headed towards a communist system. As you can see if is a question of freedom. Just as patrons have the choice to eat out or not. Also, the restaurant owner has the freedom to install fans with filters. If you cannot handle the noise and smoke then maybe you have the freedom to stay home. 
I disagree with the above statement for several reasons.  First, we (thankfully) live not in a communist or fascist nation, but in a democratic one.  The underlying pillar of a democracy is the right to choose how to live.  This right of choice must extend to restaurants.  Ownership should have the right to permit smoking on their premises.  Ownership must, however, be clear in letting both their employees and customers know that smoking is permitted.  I think signage outside the restaurant should be mandatory, clearly stating the smoking situation.  In this manner, both future employees and patrons can exercise their right of choice.  If they wish to accept the harm that smoking related illnesses cause, it is indeed their right.  Must government regulate all lifestyle choices that harm people?  Should Big-Mac sales be regulated, because over indulgence leads to obesity?  Should alcohol sales be banned, because over indulgence/reliance leads to innumerable problems?  No and No.  People have the core right to choose how to live their lives regardless of our agreement.  I personally loathe smoking.  I find it a foul smelling and disgusting habit.  For this reason, I am a big fan of Starbucks, who ban smoking in their stores worldwide.   
I disagree with this position. First of all, I disagree on the grounds that there is no clear reason to pick on smokers. We smokers do not live in denial of scientific facts, we readily accept that smoking is not a healthy habit (it causes all sorts of lung and respiratory ailments). We are constantly reminded at work and at home that we should quit, preventing us from smoking with our afternoon coffee seems simply petty. I say this as I watch the person at the table next to me (on the other side of the glass wall now used to segregate the smokers) gulp down a massive steak dinner along with a few beersÅc I guess IÅfd feel better if government went after overeating and overdrinking with the same enthusiasm as they seem to exhibit when persecuting smokers! An finally, IÅfm certainly not happy with the idea that smoking is bad for everybody (non-smokers included). I own a gun and like to go hunting, IÅfm very careful about not harming anyone in the process. I behave the same way when it comes to smoking: I make sure that my smoke does not bother anyoneÅc If only other smokers were the same way, this would not be such a problem! 
I disagree with this statement for a few reasons.  There are currently a high percentage of people in the country who smoke and they are being ostracized from their patrons.  Smoking on the street is starting to be outlawed in many cities and the number of places where a person may smoke is slowly decreasing.  If a person cannot smoke in a restaurant, there will become very few places for them to do so.  Ultimately, smokers will be left with nowhere to smoke but their own homes, and I do not need to mention the impact this will have on the millions of children whose parents smoke. There is no reason why restaurants cannot continue the trend of separating smokers from non-smokers with sections and partitions.  This technique is very effective and satisfies both parties of smokers and non-smokers to the extent whereby non-smokers can only complain about the looming clouds of smoke in the glass box next to them which is pedantic to say the least.  Of course, there are still restaurants where this set-up is non-existent, and this is undoubtedly a cause for grievance among non-smokers and smokers who prefer a clean environment while eating.  The solution is to enforce mandatory segregation for smokers and to ensure that there is adequate ventilation to expel the smoke.  This is a solution that I have already stated works and is a win-win situation for both groups.  There is no need for a complete ban on smoking in restaurants when there are other alternatives.   
I disagree with this statement for a several reasons. I myself am actually not a smoker, but I have many co-workers who do smoke and canÅft say that persecuting them for their bad habits has been entirely effective. I have two reasons: First, I find it a bit unfair to go after the smokers only. I look around me at the office and I see a few smokers (who can no longer smoke in the office, thank god!) but also a number of large, overweight, inactive slobs. Why not badger the fat people? They seem to be always tired, have a hard time going anywhere fast, and tend to get sick a lot more than those of us who actually go to the trouble of eating healthy and exercising. As far as I care, perhaps they should smoke, they at least get the exercise from having to get up and walk to the smokersÅf room not to mention that nicotine is an effective appetite suppressant. WhatÅfs more, smokers have been turned into less reliable workers. By severely restricting the number of locations they can smoke, they have had to go further and further away from where they need to or should be during the day in order to take a puff. How many times have I wanted to ask one of my smoker co-workers a quick question only to find that he/she was out for a cigarette break! I totally support putting glass walls between the smokers and the rest of us for health reason, but if we go too far, not only will we find that our measures are not effective in cutting down the number of smokers, weÅfll also realize that weÅfve driven out and alienated an entire group of people for very little benefit.
  I agree this opinion that part-time job is important for college school students, because I studied a lot of thing with my part-time job.   At first, the communication skill is necessary to work. We must talk to owner and companion, although it is not so necessary to talk to others at college school. We must talk to our guests too. We can get good communication skill with working. we can many variety friends too. At working place, there are many peoples. Their age or environment who grow up is different from yourselves. When you get along with them, you know new inspiration and it will be useful thing.  Second, the experience get money from working is important for our life of college school student. We will have to make a effort to get a good job. For these difficult activities, part-time jobs are practice. We must appeal ourselves to owners both of them to get work. If we get part-time job, this success is turned into our confidence.  Third, many University student want more money. Someone need money because play with their friends. Someone need for traveling. Someone need for hobbies. Someone need for eating enough. Part-time job is best for us to make money.
I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are three reasons I think so. By the way I have a part-time job. I wrote reasons which base on my experience of part-time job. At first, I can have a experience of society by having a part-time job. When we do something, we have commitments. In part-time job, I feel it strongly. We canÅft get money easily. I did hare work and then I could get money. I can learn importance of money. We ,university student, can change part-time jobs so we can be a man who sale bread or clothes and then be a man who deliver news paper or pack or a man cook crape or okonomiyaki ,teacher of private school, a shop boy of first food or coffee shop and so onÅc If we were thirteen years old, could we change the jobs easily? I think the answer is no. Changing jobs is not easy for a businessman.   Second reason is that we can meet many people at part-time job. I made friends with many people at part-time jobÅ@and some one go to different university, some one is different age, some one is from different part of Japan. If I didnÅft start part-time job, I would never meet some of them. Things talked by different university student or different age person are very interesting to me. I can know what I have never known.   Third reason is that getting money refers to help my parents and we can get money to do what I want to do by getting money. I can buy books and clothes, bags.   It follows from this three reasons that I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. 
I agree with the college students having a part-time job. Because they can do various experiences that they cannot do at the university.  First, they can know happiness of work. When they said by the guestsÅethank youÅf, they are sure to feel happy. Then their will to work is increased. Secondly, Work is "a place of learning". They must learn many things to perform a job. But they can acquire many skills trough the job. (For example, if you teach high school students, you can get the ability of teaching simply.) That is to say, they can acquire skills while getting money.       Finally they can fill a gap between reality and ideal. We tend to estimate working lowly. However, when they work actually, they notice that working is harder than they have expected. Although they may be disappointed then, I think they approach to an adult by one step through such experience.      For such a reason, I agree with the college students having a part-time job. But, I also think that it is bad to spend too much time in a part-time job. Their main job is learning. So they should have part-time job as long as it does not disturb the learning. 
I think itÅfs important for college students to have a part time job.  Firstly I will tell you that a part time job give you the money that you can use freely. Secondly I will talk about that a part time job makes you notice how hard you earn money.  Finally I will explain that a part time job enable you to use their free time freely.  The first point is that a part time job gives you the money that you are free to spend. For example, university , especially national university students are poor. They spend almost allowance or scholarship on the cost of living. But they can travel and eat delicious food if they have a part time job.  The second point is that a part time job makes you notice how hard you earn money. For example, they will be sometimes scolded or be taught severely by their boss when they work. They will put up with such pressure and learn how hard they earn money.  The third point is that a part time job enables you to use your time usefully. For example, college students donÅft have money , but they have a lot of time. They have too much time on their hands if they donÅft have a part job. However they learn various things when they donÅft study .     So, in conclusion, I believe itÅfs important for college students to have a part time job.       
I agree with the statement. So I have a part-time job in a cake shop since last September.  First, college students need some money. In my case, my parents give some money to me. But I need more money than that because I want to go shopping, eat nice food, and travel.  Second, we can have important experience at a part-time job. Through this experience, I notice that it is very hard to earn money. So I want to thank my parents. In addition to that, I can learn good manners. For example, I learn how to use polite words and how to give good service.  Finally, I can meet many people. There, I meet same college students, different college students, and people who make cakes. I canÅft meet them in my daily life. I talk to them and I can learn many things. One day, I talked with a man who makes cakes. He is nineteen years old and I am also nineteen years old. I asked him about his work. He answered that it was very hard but he liked the work. And he talked about his dream. He said that he wanted to have his own shop in the future, so he worked hard. I thought his life was very different from my life but I wanted to do work like him in the future. 
I think that a part time job is important for college students. I have several reasons and anxiety. The first reason is a shortage of money. Students who are given enough money by their parents are a minority. Moreover they spend a lot of money for various purposes. For example, clothes, CDs, furniture and foods. So they must earn money as much as possible. The second reason is that the experience of a part time job gives us various abilities which are important to work as a member of society. If they experience teaching, they get an ability to express their thought simply. If they work at the restaurant, they learn to be able to behave politely. For these reasons, I insist that a part time job is important for college students. But, it is not pleasant to concentrate all their energies on a part time job. It is clear that they are students. So it should be avoided to neglect their study. Furthermore a part time job can cause dangers. For example, a crime may happen at their workplace when they work. Therefore I think it is important to understand faults of a part time job and cope with the both of study and work.
I think that college students should a part-time job. Of course many people think the important thing to be study for them, and I think so. It is the situation that they should avoid that study becomes negligent by a part-time job.  It is a thing to get money at the cost of own time and work force to a part-time job. I am tired and lose it until time that is one's freedom when I work too much it. However, they can know society by experiencing it and can grow up mentally. I can obtain a lot of ability by touching the people whom I met newly at a new place. This has many things that are not obtained by the study.  In addition, the income of a part-time job is very important for rooming house students. Because it just turns into their food. They may become the situation that cannot get the supper of the day if they do not earn money by a part-time job by oneself. Therefore I think a part time job to be an important thing for college students. However, they should not forget that study is the most important. Because it is oneself to be troubled in the future if I neglect study.  
I agree with college student do a part time job. Because I think that it will be good for student. Moreover it is need for students who donÅft have enough money to go to college. And for most students need money. Because we need money for club and play. And I think that doing a part time job is good for students for their future. For example we can experience many things. And I think in college doing only study is not good for students. Indeed study is important for students to graduate school and work in the future. But study is not all for students. We can experience new thing that we cant experience for study. Bud we should not forget that it is important for students to keep our balance. It is not good for you to do a part time job too hard. Because do a part time job too hard may cause me cant graduate school. And I think that it is important to choose a part time job. Because if it were not suit me, it is useless for me. So we need to choose a part time job seriously. Therefore my opinion is part time job is important for students but it is need to care.
I quite agree with student have a part-time job. The first reason that I think this is I have a part-time job.   I work at cram school as a teacher twice a week in Monday and Thursday evening. If you want to do, you are able to be a cram school teacher without experience. The wage of this part-time job is more efficient than the other part-time job. Besides I teach study to pupil or junior high school student, I also study that I forgot things.   In general terms, a student of university who lives all by him or herself is poverty. So he should work as a part-time job, otherwise he cannot use money for pastime or sports I think it is reason why many students have part-time job.   If you can it efficient, you should do part-time job, because I think it maybe very useful for your life and future.  But some people may say Ågthe student should studyÅh I think it is not strange. But I think there are no people who spend all his time to study. So I recommend you try to work as part-time job instead of break. Perhaps you will be able to make a lot of friends too.  
I think it is important for college student to do a part time jobs.There are some reasons that make me think so.First,in campus life ,it is important for college student not only to stdy but also to play with friends.To play with friends ,we need money .So we have to do a part time job to make money.In campus life ,it is indispensable for colllege student to enjoy themselves.Second,we can study society.For example,in a part time job of service,we have to pay attention to custemer constantly.Thanks to this,we can come to give a lot of care for friends.Besides ,for example,we notice greeting is important.When we worked in an ofice,greeding is essentinal.Third,we find it difficult to get money.Before we do a part time job, we have thought that money is a thing parents gve us easily and soon.But after we did a part time job,we notice.Parents worked hard and get money.Parents give us this important money.Because I knew importance of moneyand difficulty of getting money.I thanked  parents again.Because of these reasons I think it is important for collepe student to do a part time job.After you did a part time job you feel something important.
In my opinion ,it is important for college students to do a part time job . Because when they graduate from the college , they have to work . If they have never done a part time job , they will have difficulty in getting accustomed to their job ,and they will not be able to manage their money and they will not be able to understand value of money . So they will ruin their life and they will bother not only their parents but also other people . So I think college students should do a part time job at least once when they are college students . But if they are not able to get a credit ,and they are not able to graduate from the college ,they should quit the part time job immediately . What I want to say is that college students should do a part time job ,if a part time disrupts their study . So I want to do a part time job some time when I am a college student and I think that I have to do a part time job some time ,though I do not still get accustomed to new college life and now I do not do a part time job . 
I think we need to do a part time job for some reasons.  Firstly, we can do what we usually donÅft do, and what we can do just now. When we work for company in the future, we will donÅft have much time. Then we canÅft challenge a lot of things, for we can do many type of job only in a part time job. It is a chance to see things from the other side.  Secondly, we can meet many type of people who we canÅft meet at college, because they are various generations or they live in a different environment. Lastly, we can understand how hard we get money. We have been raised by our parents, so we donÅft know their pains. But, we can know the value of parents and money by experiencing the hardships.  That is why I think we should do a part time job. So I want to experience many type of job and I hope to study many things that I can do only out of college.
 I am against this statement. Some say that the experience is important when we begin to work. But when I ask them to tell me concretely what is important for, they cannot answer, or the answers are trivial. I do not think there is what we can get only through pert time jobs. I think the statement just excuse for the fact that they do not want to work. How many students will write the reports that convince me? I think that they consider great reasons only the purpose of giving in the reports, and write great reasons as if they were sensible. It is nonsense. I wonder they want to do pert time jobs with such reasons.   Then, when we work, probably we hesitate to use money too much. It is economical, but I think annoying.   Anyway, I do not mean that students should not do pert time jobs. Some must work for living, helping their families or getting pocket money. I think those who want to do a pert time job do. Though I did write I am against, what I really mean is that I do not want to be told by students who have pert time jobs that I had better do pert time jobs as if I were NEET. 
Part-time job is important for the university student. Before working in society, as for us it is necessary to do part-time job. Because, if we work suddenly in the society whose responsibility is heavy, we are confused and can't work well. Furthermore, it will become valuable experience to work various jobs. Perhaps, after we start working as a society member, there may be no sufficient time in order to work or play variously. Therefore, to do part-time job is better in order to get used to busy society and have valuable experience which we may not experience in future. And we can make friends or seniors who are not friends in university or club.    But I don't think everything is good for college students. It is very bad that one starts working with vague feeling and retires at once. To retire dislike jobs at once have the man lose patience. If the man who lost patience start working in society, he can't probably continue his work. Recently, the number of young people who can't get a job is increasing. While the rate of unemployment of the middle age people keeps high percentage, this is also a serious problem.    It is very good that to experience various jobs and to earn by ourselves for parents even a little. But we should choose a job carefully and continue patiently. 
I think itÅfs not important for college students to do a part time job. Because, studentÅfs job is studying, I think. College students must study more hard. Studying is more important than part time jobs for college students. It is often said college students need a lot of money. Actually students want a lot of money for play with their friends and so on, so they want to have part time jobs. Some college students live alone, so they need pay the cost of living. They may need to work for living. I have friends who have part time jobs. Some of them do both a part time job and study properly, but others do not so. The former is wonderful, but the latter is bad. A lot of students who have part time job tend to be the latter. They do part time jobs too hard, so they are very tired and sleepy in their class. If they are too tired to study, they should not have part time jobs.  Studying in college is difficult, so students who want to work at any cost should work in long vacations and save money. Then they can do both part time jobs and studying, I think. 
I think that college students have to do a part-time job. Because they need much money than high school students.  First reason is that they donÅft have school uniforms. So, they have to buy a lot of clothes. Needless to say, they doesnÅft only buy clothes but also variety things like shoes and bags.     Second reason is that many of them started to live alone, when they became college students. So, they canÅft usually get enough money from their parents.  Third reason is that text books of college are expensive.  Forth reason is that they get a lot of free time than high school students.    Now I have a part-time job. I started it when I became college students. And I learned a few rules of society, thanks to do part-time job. And I knew how difficult to get money for working myself, and I noticed the importance of money.    To conclude, I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.    But, they have to study enough to step up the next year. I knew the person who could not step up his next year because of the surplus part-time job.   
I agree to this opinion. And I have two reasons.  Firstly, part-time job is good experience for college students. I think that part of college students had never worked in their life . Therefore I think that college student should work to acquire social experience .   Secondly , I think that it is important for them to earn money by themselves .   I think that it is not necessarily bad to depend on parent . However, I think that it is not good to depend on parents for all money that they need by their college life. I think that they must absolutely experience to earn money for their future .  But , doing part-time job has not only merit but also demerit .  For example, if a college student works at a part-time job too much, they will seldom go to a university. College students must study . And they must have gone into the university, in order to study. Therefore, the college student has to give top priority to study . They should drop out of a university if they do not study. And I think that they should work . It has a merit and demerit to work part-time job in this way. I think that the college student should work at a part-time job if it judges synthetically.          
 I agree this opinion that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are three reasons.   First reason is that we can experience strictness of the world by working. It is very important.    Secondly, having part-time job teaches us the value of money and hardship of our parents. In the case of mine, I worked very hard for a month; however I got no more than fifty thousand yen. I understood difficulty of making money.   Final reason is that we can get the opportunity of talking many people. All over the world, there are various people who have a different sense of values. So taking such a man spreads our view of the world.   There may be also persons who say that college studentsÅf main work is study! To be sure, we attend the lecture to learn the expert knowledge. We lose the time for study by working part-time job.    However, the thing which is needed is not school career but human nature when we go into the world. I think that a part-time job is very good for training the human nature. Pleasure, club and part-time job are also ÅgstudyÅh.   For the reasons I agree this opinion. 
I think that it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. Furthermore, I think that college students should experience many kinds of job. I have two reasons for my opinion.  First, they should know difficulty of making many. I think if they know it, they will thank for their parents who work for them to make many and notice value of many. So they will seas to be against their parents and waste many. And I think that they can make bases of jobs by experiencing many kinds of job. The bases will help them when they start to work and make them people who have depth of humanity. I think people who have only study are foolish and not interesting and not useful at all. I think there are few people who have ability to live with only study.  Second, I think they should relate many kinds of people. Thing I most have thought since I started a part-time job is that college are full with people like me. In college, people have similar ability of study and similar thought and similar dream and experience similar high school time and are similar age. I think it is important for us to communicate with college friends. But it is not enough for college students only communication of them. For example, I have been noticed to many things and been thought of many things by communicate with many kinds of people who have verity of thought and have experienced verity of life and are verity of ages.  By these reasons, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  
I agree with this idea. We can learn various things for part time job. First, it is important for a part time job to save time. We must not be late for the job different from meeting friends in school. If you were late for the job, you would trouble others. And you may lose your confidence, too. By working a part time job, I think, we can ready to go out strictly society in near future. Second, it is important for a part time job to use money. Through we are experience how we get money, we donÅft spend too much money more than need and you found importance of parents. Also you can buy wanted things and become happiness. Third, it is important for a part time job to learn human relations. For example, it is how to use respect words. We can be learned various things by others without relating age. College student is adult. A part time job is a place of experience. We should think how we should move in working and we would like to move more than now. If we become adult in society, we would like to use our experience. All of this I think college student should work various part time jobs. 
I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job because college students only study but also experiment a lot of situation. A part-time job has the things that I do not get in the college life. I talk about me. I have the part-time job in Book off. I learned a lot of things. For example, I learned that being said ÅgThank youÅh is more pleasant than I think. I learned importance of money and do not use little money than the time which I am a high school student in. I learned how to use correct Japanese languages and how to deal with a register. I communicated with all kinds of people and I increased the chances that I talked with old people in. I knew a lot of things and I increased friends. If I do not have part-time job, I do not learned a lot of things and increased the time which I do nothing. But, I think that it is bad to work part-time too much and not to study. I think that a working student should work part-time moderately. So, I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.   
"I am agreement with most of statement. There are two reasons why I agree this statement  and one reason why I donÅft agree this statement. One reason is that college students need a lot of money because they have to buy many expensive tests and pay the cost of living, for example, to go to their college or to eat, and they spent their money on joining club activity or going to party. If they want to live enjoyable life without much relying on parents, they make a lot of money by a part-time job. Another reason is a part-time job may enable them to experience the social life and learn what is really is. This is because money which they had spent on buying their clothes and going to play and so on was earned by their parents, so they donÅft understand the value of money. And, having a part-time job help them to understand it. That is why it is certain that I agree this statement, but, of course, the most important thing for college students is to study what they want to learn. Therefore, they should have a part-time job without forgetting to study. This is the only point which I donÅft agree this statement." 
"I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I think that there are three reasons.   At first, I think that college students should do what they want to do during school days. For example, studying abroad, traveling some countries, traveling Japanese, etc. If they do these things, they must grow up more than now. But they actually can not do these things. Because they do not have much money, they can not do these things. So they need a lot of money and must save for what they want to do.   Second reason is to learn real societies. A lot of college students will work in offices. Then, if they do not know real societies, they can adapt themselves to real societies easily. So they need to have a part-time job.   Third reason is to meet people of various generations. But almost all the people are not same generation with college students in real societies, they must work in offices. If they can experience to meet people of various generations during school days, they can adapt themselves to real societies. In other word, to have a part-time job is to gather experiences in real societies.       " 
" I agree with this opinion. Because I think that a part-time job tells us  many important things, for example, formal actions, manners, communication  ability, and relationships with many people.  One month ago, I started a part-time job. I wash a lot of dishes and take  some drinks and delicious foods at sushi restaurant. Sometimes, there are  some high-ranked persons such as a boss of a big company, a famous baseball  player, or a doctor of a big hospital in this restaurant. So, I must take  formal actions for them. But there are no manuals, and I have to consider  how I take for them.  In this sushi restaurant, there are five college students to work as a  part-timer. They are second or third grad, so, we can be friends easily.  Especially, one girl is my classmate and my friend since last year. Several  times, we went to the sushi restaurant together. Because she has worked at  this restaurant since last year, she teaches me many works and rules.  Through this part-time job, we make good friendship.  I think that a part-time job tells us many important things, and I think  that it can make us a good person, too. We are student now. But about three  years later, we will be workers in social world. I think that I havenÅft  prepared to be a worker yet, but now is a chance to prepare. A part-time job  is very important for us. It tells us many important things. So, I think it  is important for college students to have a part-time job.  " 
"I agree with this statement. Because, we can experience many kind of jobs. We will get the job in the future. Then, we will do work it by being 65 old. I want to do many kind of job, for example, food shop, super market and industry. We are given connection of people by doing a lot of jobs. That people have many differences; olds, club, school and living place. So, we can get much kind of information.    It is good that we make some money by ourselves work. We use the money important which we get by our work. We understand that the money is very important. Someone may say that we can understand this statement when we work in the society. But, I think we should see the kind of importance as soon as possible.   Sometimes, I meet one who doesnÅft do part time jobs. I often say to the person ÅgYou should work and you should make the money yourself.Åh If we donÅft do job, we canÅft pass enjoy campus life without the money our parents give. It isnÅft cool!  When we are college students, I think that we make our money by ourselves. Maybe, it lead to the road which we live in the world by the power of ourselves. " 
"I agree that college students work part-time. I think that t he working make us to acquire sociality that doesnÅft obtain  it at school. A university student who is mentally mature t han the high school student might obtain more. Of course, th ere is a limit. We mustnÅft neglect our studies because of t he part-time job. I think, when we work part-time, it is nec essary to consider the working time.  Moreover, it is one of the big reasons why university stude nts need a lot of money. The person who was attending high s chool with the uniform should buy some clothes, and the text  book and the reference book are more expensive than high sc hool days because they are special. Human relations expand,  and it increases association such as parties. The person who  joins a club spends money on club activities, and someone h as to earn the cost of living.  In these reasons for which money is necessary, there is som ething to enjoy the university. Most people who oppose the p art-time job of university students will have dissatisfactio n with which these enjoyments decrease the time to study. In  short, I think that the university life is massive if the b alance of the study and the enjoyment is good. " 
I agree on working part-time of university students. I have some reasons why I agree on working part-time. Firstly, in university, we can study society with only books. With only books, there are many things that we donÅft know about real society. We had better really work part-time and understand difficulty of earning money, working with many people, and so on. Secondly, we students needs much money when we do everything. We want to do very funny things that we can not do in school days, such as traveling world, playing with friends, loving girl friend, and so on. These things cost much money, so we need much money. We may rely on parents, but we should live by ourselves as diligent as we can. Thirdly, we had better make friends as many as we can make. It is the most important thing in my life and school life. I suppose that student should not study but make more friends. Friends is more important property than food, water, money and so on. So, we had better part in working part-time, we should much more friends in not only university but also part-time-job. In such ways, letÅfs enjoy school-days and make it very significant thing.   
"I agree that students do part time jobs.  I think that working hard to get money is important and necessary.  When we get some money, we can live our richer lives.  Those who don't agree this might think that working declines students' studying time.  And they also think that studying is students' duty.  I slightly agree them. It is common sense.  But I think that what is good for their lives in university is not only studying.  They have to do other things except for studying.  They are students in university and human beings.  Human beings have to communicate with others.  What they do so is what they spend money. Because they are students in university.  University and high school have a lot of great differences.  I think that one of them is atmosphere among its students.   High school students are still childish, but university students are almost adult.  So they tend to and are natural to acts in the way adults do.  To act in that way needs a lot of money. So they have to work to get money.  If they do not work, they have to rely on their parents' money.  To rely on their parents' money completely is too bad. The money is for their living.  To spend the money is rude for their parents.   For these reasons, I agree that students do part time jobs. " 
"I think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. It is because the experience to work and to get money with themselves may make the college students growing up. Angering their boss and missing their job may give them rich spirit. After they become the member of society, they will enjoy and leave wonderful achievement. If they donÅft have a part-time job when they are the college students, some of them will be worthless people. They donÅft know the society. They donÅft know that itÅfs importance to get money with working. Of course, some of the college students who donÅft work know that important view. But, many of the college students may not know. I think. Other reason of the importance of a part-time job is simply. College students need much money. Whether they stay home with their family or not, they may want to enjoy the college life. It may be the play, study and love. Anyway, they need much money. So they must have a part-time job. Finally, I think, it is not only the college students but also society to want the college student to have a part-time job. The college students are the element of society, too. If none of them worked, society might not exist. " 
"I agree with this idea. Now, I take some reasons. First, college students are going to work somewhere. And they will work full time. Full time job is very hard and tough. They have to experience some part time job to get over this. If they experience part time job, they will increase efficiency. And because they can experience various jobs, they can find what job goes with them. And they can find out some goals. Goals are very important for college students. Second, I think that college students had better earn the cost of living and school fees as much as they can. The reason I say so is that college students could choose the way to study or to work. But they choose to study and task their parents. So I think they lead a life by themselves as much as possible. Third, they can learn importance of money by working part time job. Therefore they reflect how they use some money. And they think what they want to buy is what they really need. So they will not buy what they do not need really. So I think that it is important for college students to have a part time job. " 
"I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I state the reason now. First!! Use the time effectively! College students comparatively have more free times compared with a member of society. Time is precious if we spend the time wastefully. Therefore, we have a part-time job. By doing part-time job, we get money. We will be able to go shopping and to the movie by the money in next free time. This cycle make the time effective. Second!! Get money that we can use freely. We can buy many things (car, house, jewelry, clothes, bags, plane ticket, and so on) which we want no matter how it is much by the money.  Third!! Learn society I think that to learn society is most important when we are at university. To learn society means that we acquire decency and learn communication with seniors or juniors in business. We can do them by part-time job. Surely, a way of learning society is not only part-time job. But, it is the most suitable because it is the nearest to the society on the point of business. Some people may argue that we neglect study. I think so too. But there are many merit of supplementing it. So, I agree to have a part-time job.  " 
"I agree with this statement. Because I think that I did grow up through my part-time job. My part-time job is to contact with other people. So I must explain the content of the contact to many people very clearly, shortly and briefly. And it is out of the question to say non-collect things. For the first time, I found the importance and responsibility to what I say. And I also learned the difficulty of making myself understood, and I always need to think if what I try to explain to others is what they want to know truly. Or I have to reform what I want to say to what ordinary people understand easily and comprehend otherÅfs saying exactly. Unless I cannot, they donÅft get good explains they want, so they donÅft think they want to contact with me. Of course, at first, I could not do it perfectly, but now I can (sometimes others and I also cannot understand what I sayÅc). Thus, I believe that I learned many things from my part-time job, and my work-teamÅfs other staffs who help, advise and teach me. These experiences will help me in the future when I actually work as an office worker. So I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. But needless to say that it is not good to consider doing part-time job is much more important than study!  " 
"I think it is very good that college student have part time job. Off course, I also do part time job. Good point of part time job is, first, it can be meaningful use of our free time. Before I began a part time job, I didnÅft know how to deal with my after school time. Second, it teaches us how important money is. When I was high school student, I was gave pocket money from parents. I didnÅft know how hard earning money is before began it. " 
"I agree with this subject. Many students work part-time in order to enjoy school life. Enjoyment differs from student to student. That is playing with friends or getting to a license or saving or paying for oneÅfs hobby. But some student can not get credit because they work part-time. They lose sight of original purpose. Some parent opposes this subject because of this. Money that student earn in school life is little. When students become a member of society, they earn same money soon. So they should pay money that they earn soon. Money to pay in school life is difficult from money to pay in society life.   I know student who pay school fee. KOBE University is public university, but this school fee is never cheap. This price is seven hundred thousand by year. For students, this price is very high price. So he always works part-time. When I think him, I think     students who can spend school life without working is rich. Some students need not work, but some students need work. Some students are rich, some students are poverty.   Because in university students have various circumstances, I think students work part-time without losing credit should be permitted.   " 
"I agree to students having part time jobs.   Because students can learn many things by having part time jobs  Firstly, students can learn real society by part time jobs    It will never be studied at school.  By learning it  students gradually become adults.  Secondly, a part time job can be improved studentÅfs communication skill.  In the place there are many persons who are different from age and character.  To work with various persons is certainly improved studentÅfs communication skill   Thirdly by a part time job students can learn importance for money   Until now we get money for our parents.   So to get money by yourselves is improved your sense of value for money  But a part time job is not only good.  For example , some students may work part time jobs too much to have times to study.  Some students may work part time jobs too much. They donÅft have times to sleep.   They may sleep in the lessons and donÅft  follow the lessons.  Not to do it we have to get along with college lifes and part time jobs.  It is important for students to study in the college and work part time jobs  And I think students enjoy college life.    " 
"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. The reason is that we must not completely depend on our parents permanently and the time which we are college student is the chance to independence from our parents. There are a lot of college students who lives far away from their parents. They must do all things for themselves. If they don't have a part-time job they depend on their parents to have the money. That is burden for their parents and they are limited their movements when they are free. Certainly it is difficult to earn all money to live from the part time job but they can earn a part of money to live. I think that is the first step to independence from parents.   Other reason is that if we have a part-time job it is advantage when we have a permanent-job. I think to work as part-time is a study and when we work in the near future the experience will help us. Furthermore if we work as part-time we meet a lot of people. That is also important for us.  In these reason, I think that to have a part-time job is important for college students.  " 
"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have some reasons why I agree with this opinion. First of all, many college students need money. Especially, I have little money because I am living alone. I have to buy foods, furniture, drug, and so on with my own money. Second, I will be able to learn many things, which we can not learn at college if I have a part-time job. For example, I will be able to learn about courtesy. This is more important for me than school education when I become a member of society. To be a useful person in the future, it is indispensable to have a part-time job. Third, I will be able to find that [money is important]. Now, I use the money which my parents. And, I waste money. However, I save money when I use the money which I earn with spending herd time. So I come to be thankful to parents. From those reasons, I agree with this opinion. However, I do not have a part-time job now. So I am going to find a part-time job which suitable for me by summer vacation. Thank you. " 
I think it is important for college student to have a part-time job.  First, we need to get some enough money to live.  In my case, I have to pay costs of rent and school expenses by  myself. So, I need to get a scholarship and work for going to the  college. If you donÅft enough to earn your rent and school expenses,  you must need some money. When you want to go abroad and get  a driving license, for example, you have to get large money. You   must have a part-time job to wish your hope.   Second, part-time job is useful for your future.   I have two part-time job. One of my job is a restaurantÅfs staff, the   other is a teacher. Managers of both are good friend of mine. So, they   teach me about the management, a social situation, their experience   and so on. There is a lot of learning from their talk. In addition, to  have a part-time job is to become a working member of society. So,  when we think about our future, the experience of part-time job is   useful. Moreover, we can learn some social common sense.   That is why I think having a part-time job is important for college student.   
I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Part-time job gives us not only some money but also very precious experience for our future. I have worked at a SUSHI shop for 4 years. Tasks teach me a lot of things. For example, I learned manner to superiors and customers. It is so useful when I get a job. And I got good relationship with coworkers in the shop. I always enjoy talking with them after working. There is much kind of people (such as high school student, college student, housewife and so on) in my shop, so I can listen to various stories from them. Their stories are to my benefit. We canÅft get these things in the school. I could change myself from myself before the part-time job was started. But if I take a lot of time for the part-time job, I am not able to study regularly. However, part-time job is very important; the most important thing is studying for us. I will keep working part-time job until I graduate from my university, but I will take care the way of using the time. I want to cope with both study and part-time job.   
I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Because it is not only to give money but it is one of the social studies, I think. Almost of college students can get money that they need to live from their parents. So I think that we donÅft need to have a part time job for getting money. I donÅft have a part time job now. But I can live enough now. And, college students have to study. But to have a part time job is not only for to get money. It is good social studies. It makes me thinking to get money is what and work in the social is what. And, we can learn social rule, way of talk, and more. For my example, I had a part time job in YAKINIKU restaurant. My work in the restaurant is service customer. I learn how to talk to customer and rule of meal a little. And the restaurant has many foreign customers, so I can learn English in restaurant well. Part time job have many what to learn and is very good social study. So I think college student have to have a part time job.  
I agree with this statement. We can obtain many things. For example ,manners, sociability and money.  I think that manners and sociability are very important when we will go to society. Especially, money are very important for the college students. In the college student, their are many times but students have little money. When we will be a member of society ,we would have little time. So we had better experience many things within college students. Club activity, travel and enjoy with friends need money. A part-time job available to gain money. The reason of to do a part-time job is to gain money in many people. For enjoy college we need many money. I think that the more enjoy college life, the more succeed study in college school. But our purpose is to study in college, so we must not neglect for reasons of a part-time job. If we can not study because of a part-time job, we must not do a part-time job. I think the only people that study well may do a part-time job. If we note the point of that, we can do a part-time job and enjoy college life. So I agree with that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. 
  I do not agree this opinion that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.   Certainly, Smoking makes air dirty and bad smell. Cigarette is bad for the body. It is contain many material that causes cancer. Many smokers are died because of cancers. But the best reason of person not smoking hate Smokers is that smoke from smokers is bud for bodies  too when people breathes it in. This is more effective than smoke themselves. So that, recently, smokers are disliked at almost places.   However,  I think smoking  prohibited all the restaurants is not best way. Certainly smokers and people who don't smoke must be completely separated but cigarettes have been already the heavy part of our culture. Most important thing is that alarm the risk of smoking. So if smokers know It's danger enough, we should allow their smoking places. Like restaurant we can enter with our pet, that we can make smoke can be made.   Some of my friends are smokers. They are good people. It is not good thing hate people because they are smoking. When they save smoking manner, for example don't smoke at public spaces, and don't make trouble to us, we should get along with them. 
I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. There are two reasons why I think so. First, tobacco does harm to people and gives people no good. TobaccoÅfs smoke has harmful substance. Sniffing the smoke is taking the substance in our body. It is reported by many doctors that taking the substance in our body join to high risk of lung cancer and second hand smoke has the more substance than main stream smoke. Second hand smoke is smoke from tobaccoÅfs one end which is burning. Main stream smoke is smoke from tobaccoÅfs another end. People who breathe second hand smoke is near smoker. Breathing second hand smoke is passive smoking and breathing main stream smoke is active smoking. In other words, if we mention only one tobacco, risk of lung cancer is higher in passive smoking than in active smoking. That means people who is near smoker has higher expectation of having lung cancer than smoker. It is trouble that be made breathing smoke which he doesnÅft hope and his lung cancer risk becomes higher. User of restaurant is many, so many user gives trouble. Second reason is that smoke of tobacco smells bad. I think this idea is not minority. The restaurant is place where we eat. When we eat, we enjoy not only taste but also smell. So bad air because of tobacco makes delicious dinner taste bad. Above two reasons make me think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. 
In my opinion, smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants inÅ@Japan. There are two reasons for that.   The first thing is that people who like smoking do not want to go to the restaurant if smoking is completely prohibited. There are a lot of people who like smoking in Japan. Some of them often smoke after the meal. But they have to put up with smoking after it if smoking is controlled. So they can not enjoy eating and drinking at the restaurant. And for people who do not smoke, they can not go to the restaurant with smokers.   The second thing is that the profit of the restaurant decreases if smoking is forbidden.  If people who like smoking do not go to the restaurant, it is not too much to say that the profit of the restaurant decreases so much. In addition, it is possible that their family or friends do not go to the restaurant as many times as now. In such a case, it will be difficult for the owners of restaurants to keep restaurants.   Today there are two kinds of seats in many restaurants. One is the seats for smokers; the other is the seats for people who do not smoke. I think that both smokers and people who do not smoke should enjoy at the restaurants. So this service seems good to me.  That is why smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan 
I think this statement is very good for many people. I think we should not smoke at restaurant. Because some people donÅft like smoke. There are many kinds of people and families with children at restaurant. Smoking make many people get uncomfortable. I think smoke have us donÅft taste and smell food. It is no means to eat and impolite for cooks. However, some kinds of people want to smoke at any place, only restaurant. They donÅft have any bad feelings for people who donÅft smoke. So I would like to both groups have good times. Recently, smoking area separates non-smoking area in many restaurants. But some smoke come non-smoking area. In this way, it is no means to separate. It is admitted to smoke at some restaurants, strong air conditioner should be had in them to remove smoke and change air. So I think we should separate smoking and non-smoking area completely. For example, to make two flours or to build two buildings. But they are very costly and it needs wide ground. It is difficult to realize.Å@It is the easiest way that smoking is banned at all the restaurants. But I want to find better way for both groups. 
 I disagree with this opinion because I think it is the best of people to stay without constraint. Surely, nonsmokers are likely to hate smoke because it smells bad and hurt not only smokersÅfs body but also theirs. IÅfm one of them. So, I always want waiters to make smokers set away from me.  If all the restaurant ban smoking, nonsmokers are happy to be released from smoke and may be able to eat calmly. While, if this situation was realized, smokers would get angry. Or, someone may do nothing but eat without going restaurant. And, it is no exaggeration to say that smoking is the most important thing for them. If they were robbed the cigarette, they would be unsettled state of mind or be much stressed. Then, I think that it is the best way for people to establish both smoking area and nonsmoking area at the same restaurant. As smoke doesnÅft pour into nonsmoking area, an equipment such as big air cleaner must be placed. So, both smokers and nonsmokers get to stay without constraint and be pleased to go there. The restaurant also can earn much more. Thus, restaurant must make customers as much as possible be satisfied with service and kindness. I assert that as one of the service, to establish both smoking area and nonsmoking area is welcome to everyone.  
Naturally, it is necessary to divide the smoking seat and the no smoking seat at a restaurant.  Because I do not smoke, I think all seats no smoking to be good. However, if the smoking rate of Japan takes 25% into consideration, the separation of smoking areas might be the best selection.   It is really unpleasant that they smoke in the vicinity though not all the person who doesn't smoke the cigarette feel so. It is unpleasant even to encounter in the town, much less at the table.   Moreover, you will have divided the seat though it thinks from smoker's viewpoint.  Following the trend of the times, smoking in the shop not separating smoking areas is considerably insensitive. I think that the shop shouldnÅft make them endure cigarette while they are in the shop. Of course you may be in the inside such a shop. However there are a lot who like smoking with or after eating. It is natural that the shop answers the demand.  To tell the truth, there are not so much a lot of stores where the seat is divided in the entire restaurant though in a fast food and a major multiple store the separation of smoking areas is common sense already. The consideration of the shop is certainly a problem. If possible, I think that you should make the no smoking seat. However guest's mind is most importantly. Do not smoke in when the trouble hangs in the person in the next seat. 
 I agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant     In Japan.  There are three reasons why smoking should be forbided.  First, smoking is harmful for our health.  My father smoked two box a day. My mother tried hard to break him of the habit of smoking. But father was obstinate in refusing to stop smoking as mother ordered him.  At length, father had a sore throat terribly from smoking too many cigarettes. Father finally overcame his smoking habit.  Second, in the first place, the restaurants are the place where we enjoy dinner or lanch,  Not the place where you smoke. When you enjoy your dinner with your family or your  Friends, if someone smokes next to your table, how do you feel?  If you were me, I got angry entremly and I could not enjoy dinner. And cigarettes smoke makes dinner bad.  Third reason is passive smoking. This reason is the most important reason in my mind.   I want smokers not to forget what I say following. Passive smokers do not smoke but share their air space with smokers. That is to say, those who never smoke are as same as those who smoke. So the risk that they get lung cancer is nearly same probability.  Accordingly, I agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in Japan.   
I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Smoking has some problems.          First, cigarettes have a nicotine. This has drugÅfs elements like a malaria. DrugÅfs elements are very dangerous, in order to be a nicotine, you can not stop to smoke. I donÅft know the mind of junkies that continue to smoke. But if they want to stop to do, I get pity for them.          Second, cigarettes have tars. Many people think tars are substances promoting cancer growth. And cigarettes have more than forty kinds of substances promoting cancer growth. Cancer is also danger. I donÅft have heard easy cancer treatment.          Third, smokers and around people breathe in CO gas. CO tends to combine with Hb called hemoglobin. Hb is a role transporting Oxygen to all body.           Fourth, tabacoÅfs smell is always avoided. One of the people is me. I like clear and clean air.          Finally, smoking is harmful to health of no smoking people. Thin is the worst point in smoking problems. So, I donÅft want you to smoke at place existing smokeless people. But, if restaurants are separating smoking space from no smoking, I may permit to smoke at restaurants. Then, of course, restaurants must not come drifting smoke. 
Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in japan. Because smoking is bad for our health. First tabacco contain highly poisonous nicotine, volatile and liquid alkaloid, so people who smoke heavily tend to have lung cancer or get cancer in their throat. Besides passive smoking is also harmful foer us. Cigarette smoke contain a cancer-causing agent, the smoke go out our body is more poisonous than that go in ours. It's very stupid! Smoking have a bad influence on all the people being around very much.  Lastly, cigarette smoke smell bad, so smoking should be prohibit at the table. That's why I agree with this argument. 
I donÅft smoke, but I think that smoking banned completely at all the restaurants in Japan is no necessity. Instead the restaurants should be completely separated smoking area and no smoking area. One reason of them is that smoke brings more harm for people around smoker than smoker. Therefore smoker make effort to avoid disturbing people around themselves. However, smoking is private affair though smoking increase risk of some disease. We shouldnÅft oppress people who like smoke as long as they obey manner. Separate smoke area and no smoke area is the thing that canÅft set by visitors, restaurants places no smoking seat and smoking seat with consider the number of smoker and no smoker in visitors, and restaurant should import exhaust system for the sake of no smokerÅfs health. If restaurants do these measure, I have nothing complaint. If visitors donÅft want to wait, they con choose different side seat from own side. But the small shop that they arenÅft able to separate smoking area and no smoking area offer dishes that cooked only this shop and we canÅft eat except for this shop, I suffer. In this case, visitors give way to each other about smoking is only answer.  
I agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. There are two reasons why smoking should be forbade at the restaurants.   First, the taste of the cooking became bad due to the smoke and smell of cigarette. If seats in a restaurant are divided between nonsmoking seat and smoking seat, smoke and smell flow to nonsmoking seat. This is the pain for nonsmokers.  Second, smoking injures our health. Smoking harms not only smoking people but also people who donÅft smoke. All of us know that smoking causes lung disease. We  Go to a restaurant in order that we will not increase risk of disease but enjoy eating a meal. So smoking should be banned at restaurant so that all people can enjoy eating or drinking.  I know that there are a lot of people who canÅft quit smoking in Japan. But, for these two reasons, I want to prohibit smoking at restaurants. 
 I oppose banning smoking completely at all the restaurants in Japan. Because there are some faults. I would like to write about them.       Firstly it ignores human rights of smokers. Smoking surely causes harm to people in surround. But smokers have right of smoking. It is no good that we one-sidedly force our opinions.      Secondly managers of restaurants lose the revenue by ban the smoking. Because banning the smoking prevent guests of smoker go to the restaurant. So the number of guests decreases and the revenue also decreases.      Thirdly restaurant is precisely the place where guest comfortably enjoys eating. For smokers it is necessary to smoking to have a good time. Therefore banning smoking is equal with disturbing smokersÅf right of enjoying.      Finally banning smoking treats nonsmoker well and treats smokers coldly. This is a kind of discrimination. Even kids know that discrimination is bad. It pays attention to only nonsmokers.      For such reason, I oppose banning smoking completely at all the restaurants in Japan. But I agree with placing some nonsmoking seats, because it reflects nonsmokersÅf rights. This way brings equality between smoker and nonsmoker. However, it is not probably best way. I would like to study deeply and find the better way.  
I think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. There are three reasons why I agree with the ban on smoking.  First, my family and I donÅft smoke, so I smell the little flavor of cigarettes. And I donÅft like it very much. I think many people also donÅft like it. Moreover, because of the smell of cigarettes, we canÅft taste the meal at a restaurant and we canÅft eat delicious meal. So it is important to ban smoking at all restaurants.  Secondly, there are smoking seats and nonsmoking seats at some restaurants. When nonsmoking seats are full and I donÅft want to wait, I may go to smoking seats. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants, I may sit soon at nonsmoking seats. Finally, I think that if the place where we can smoke decrease, people who stop smoking increase. And we can live more comfortable than today. For example, we may not smell the flavor of cigarettes at a station or in the city. In addition to that, illnesses such as lung cancer decrease. Man say cigarettes do harm for health. Smoking has a bad effect not only on smoker but also on non-smoker.  
I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. One of the reasons is that I donÅft like smoking. When I go to a restaurant, I stop entering if there are not seats not to smoke. But I could enter a restraint if there are seats to smoke and not to smoke. Some restaurants donÅft have seats not to smoke. I do want all the restaurants to have seats not to smoke. Even if a restaurant have seats not to smoke, the seats are near by seats to smoke. So the restaurants are not different from those of not having seats not to smoke. Finally, I wish there are not tobacco in the world. But some people canÅft stop smoking. I want people not smoking to feel comfortable everyday everywhere. I think it become important to smoking peopleÅfs thinking. They can stop smoking where not smoking, or not. I want each people who smoke to consider people who donÅft smoke.  I have friends who smoke. I ask to them why they donÅft smoke. So they all answer smoking is their habit. They smoke unconsciously. Then I hate tobacco.    Really, I wish there are not tobacco in the world. 
I think that smorking must be  completly banned at all the   restaurants in Japan. The first reason is that people at restaurants want to enjoy gond meal, but smoke hinder good smell of meal. The second reason is that smoke stain with curtains and sofa of restaurants. The third reason is that if person are smorking during meal, smorker can not cncentrate on the meal. Concequently,smorking must be  completly banned at all the   restaurants in Japan.
It is said that smoking is harmful. On the other hand, there is an opinion that smoking is harmless, too. I cannot judge whether smoking is harmful. However, I want to assume that smoking is harmful and to express my opinion.  I think that smoking should not completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan .Because the no smoking seat and the smoking seat have already been divided, I think that it need not limit more than now . There may be a person who regards passive smoking as a problem, too, but I think it won't be a problem at all if a designer cares about to air conditioning. I think that the modern society becomes strict with a smoker. I think that the reason is that feelings that the Japanese wants to belong to the majority are strong. I think that they want to think that does a good action by blaming the minority. I do not trust mass communication and the government, and I think that it is necessary for people to think whether all matters are always true. The sale of the cigarette should be prohibited if smoking should be really prohibited. However, the reality is not so. A tax enters by a smoker. Therefore I think that the government does not prohibit a cigarette.  I think that it is important to watch from various angles. Therefore I think that smoking should not be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan in view of economical aspect and psychological aspect .    
I think also that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. In this essay, I want to speak about this topic why I am agreeable from two viewpoints.  At first, I decide to talk opinion from the situation as the restaurant user. As we know, the cigarette is very bad to a body even if I am passive even if active. In a restaurant, there are various people from a baby to the elderly. In the bar where only an adult is the cigarette matches alcohol, however in the restaurant where such a weak people is the  cigarette becomes only the harm for a child. And subjectively, I feel the meal badly when I eat with smoke. (But I think the coffee seems to match a cigarette.)   Next, I will speak it from the situation of the employee of a restaurant. In fact, I work at an Italian restaurant. A main reason why such I agree is that a person who doesnÅft smoke canÅft sit in the seat so that there are smoking seats. Recently the number of smokers decreases. But the number of smoking seats does not decrease. As a result, a waiting room overflows with a person waiting for a non-smoker seat. If a smoking seat disappears, the turn of the shop improves and the profit of the shop increases. In addition, there is the reason that it is troublesome for me to prepare an ashtray.   Due to these, I agree to this opinion. 
I think that smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I have two reasons why I think so. First, I think cigarettes can make oneÅfs identity and tell me felling of smoker. I have some friends and acquaintances who I characterize smoker. They who are not smoking are not real them for me and I like them who are smoking better than them who are not smoking. Furthermore, I guess feeling of smokers by their pace of smoking and how to smoke. So cigarettes are important for me when I talk with smokers. I want to enjoy spending with real them in restaurant and talk with real them. I think restaurant is not only place to eating but also place to have a good time. Second, I think cigarettes can make atmosphere. It is dangerous, mysterious and adult atmosphere. I think that some restaurants contain this atmosphere and attraction of these restaurants is composed of this atmosphere. Probably customers of these restaurants enjoy this atmosphere. If smoking is banned completely at these restaurants, the number of customers will reduce. I think we should remain these restaurants, but if smoking is banned completely at these restaurants, these restaurants will vanish.  By these reasons, I think smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  
I agree with this idea. I think two ideas to opposite smoking in restaurant.   First, smell of smoking spoil food. Taste of food depends on smell and sight. For example, if you are said that you must eat such a favorite food in the bathroom of the station, you would refuse eating food. Because, you think that you cannot eat food deliciously in the bad smell. That is why if I smell smoking when I am eating I cannot eat food tasty. There may be people who donÅft think smell of smoking uncomfortable. But such a people are minority. Most of the people who not smoke feel uncomfortable by smell of smoking. For such a people, I ask smokers not to smoke when they are eating.   Second, smoke is too bad for our health. Of course smokers tend to become lung cancer. But, people who smell smoking are more dangerous. Smell of smoking is poison to people who want to live healthy. I think, it is adult manner to take care about surroundings. If all the people save manner, we can eat food comfortably for each other.   Under two reasons, I object to smoke at all the restaurant in Japan. 
I think smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I think that when the people who smoke exist in the situation which the people who smoke is not able to smoke in, the people who smoke doesnÅft feel good and comfortably eat dinner. But, I think that smoking causes all kinds of bad situations. For example, I think that if there are the people who smoke, the people donÅft know the taste of the cooks and eat. I think that smoke may extend to all areas in restaurants and the people who donÅft smoke may feel bad. So, I think that the people in the restaurant firstly construct the space in which there are the people who donÅft smoke and the space in which there are the people who smoke. Secondly, the people in the restaurant construct a wall between the two spaces. So, the people in the restaurant are able to deal with all kinds of people and the people in the restaurant solve all kinds of bad situations. Therefore, even if smoking is not banned at all the restaurants in Japan, the people who smoke and another people comfortably eat dinner in a restaurant. As a result, I think smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  
Smoking is very harmful for people, especially young people and small children. The harm of smoking has a negative effect on people who donÅft smoke at all. For instance, cigarettes cause us cancer or some diseases. This is why they bother the smell, the smoke, and the harm of smoking. In fact, I hate it that smokerÅfs smoke in where there are many nonsmokers without caring about the influence of their smoking. Moreover the harm of smoking affects not only the health of people but also the taste of people and the flavors of the foods. This effect is always very bad. For example, the smell of cigarettes changes the smell of dishes. We go to restaurants for eating some delicious dishes. That is why smoking in a restaurant improper to an occasion of a restaurant. Therefore, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. And, I expect that the opinion realize more and more early, and then every smokers recognize cigarette donÅft need when they eat in restaurants and have manors about smoking. If we canÅft prohibit smoking in the restaurants at all, we should divide a restaurant into the space where we can smoke and we canÅft smoke.
I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I have two reasons. One of the reasons is that the smell of a tobacco is very bad smell. The smell of a tobacco often makes the people around a smoking person feel bad. When you want to have a good lunch, if you feel very bad, what do you feel this lunch?  If I am this situation, I feel very bad and very angry. I can not eat deliciously this lunch. You will feel it in the same way, too. For example, when you eat the matsutake, how will you think if you smoke in the circumference? The matsutake is food enjoying smell. Maybe you can not enjoy smell.   Second reason is that the tobacco gives person harms. It is natural that a smoking person takes harms, but the person around a smoking person will take harm. I think, but it is good to suffer damage themselves by a smoking person, it is not good to suffer from smoking people. Even if it is impossible to give up smoking, a smoking person should go out of a restaurant to smoke. I want to be only a restaurant where we can enjoy eating!            
 If smoking is completely banned at all restaurants in Japan, I must be very happy.  It is because I donÅft like smokes of cigarettes. At restaurants, I would like to enjoy delicious dishes, but smokes of cigarettes interrupt it. The smokes have very strong smell, so, I canÅft smell dishesÅf good flavor.   As another reason, most of Japanese know what smoking is very bad for our health. Smokes of cigarettes are consisted by many bad facts, for instance, nicotine, and CO2. Brain and some organs are damaged by these bad facts. And younger people are damaged more badly. Especially for children, smokes of cigarettes are big problem for their body. But they canÅft escape from it easily.   Now, there are many smokers in Japan, and I know it. But I really want smoking to be completely banned at restaurant in Japan. It is must be good for not only non-smokers but also heavy smokers. I think that almost of smokers drink alcohol when they eat dishes at restaurants. But I have heard that drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes is very bad pair. It makes their health bad gravely.    I think that this idea should be expanded all over the world, not only in Japan. And I hope that many non-smoker and smoker enjoy delicious dishes at restaurants together. 
I agree to the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in Japan. There is three reason. First, the smell of cigarette adheres to cloths. It may be no problem for smokers,but those who stop smoking can not endure the smell. Certainly, most restaurants divides into the smoking place and the no smoking place, but I do not think that it is effectual. This way can not stop smell adheres to cloths. Second, smoke of cigarette is bad for the body. It seem to be worse for those who stop smoking than for smoker. Possibly, smoker might be killing those who stop smoking. Though there are still other things, tentaverity, the above is adverse effect on the person. Finaly, scenery with cigarette is ineffectualy for restaurants. In modarn days when it is said to stop smoking, it is kept at a distance by the guest only there is cigarette. So sales of the shop worsen. In a word, adverse effect of smoking is not only body. From the above mentioned, cigarette has many disadvantage,so I agree to the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in Japan. 
  In the world, the number of smokers tends to decrease. But  there are still people who do not try to stop smoking. ÅgThe  world tends to stop smoking now. However I do not knock off  smoking. It is a preference.Åh I do not deny these words. A nd I do not worry whether the number of smokers decreases or  do not decrease so much. However, I think that it is necess ary to limit the place in which it smokes if it is considere d that the smoke of the cigarette is bad for not only smoker Åfs body but also nonsmoker's body. In addition, I think tha t the smell of the smoke ruins the taste of the dish and the  smoking with the table is against the manner. It is the sam e also when we drink. I might say an inelegant thing. But, a s a matter of fact, only a smoking person is good feelings.  Moreover, there is a no-smoking zone in restaurants. However , some restaurants are too narrow and there is no meaning th at divides the seats according to the restaurant.   I want smoking people not to smoke independently when eatin g, and it will not be achieved. So I think smoking should be  completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. 
I think that they forbit our smoking in restaurants. I have three reasons. Firstly, smoking is not healthy. It is known that one cigarettes shortens our life seven minutes.Å@A fact that the smoke of cigarettes injure our health is proved scientifically with today's medicine. Smokes don't stay outdoors. But, smoke is filled indoors such as in restaurants. So, it makes people do'nt want to smoke smoke. A number of people donÅft like smoke of cigarettes. So, in restaurants, a lot of people dislike smoke of cigarettes too.   It is hated by many people who don't want to smoke. It is not good fact morally. Secondly, cooks want us to enjoy their cooking with all of our senses. We enjoy cooks with firstly eye, secondly noses, thirdly touch, fourthly tongue, finally ears. If it smelled smoke of cigarettes in restaurantsÅAthe good smells of cooking is made by cooks is spoiled. Thirdly we should enjoy not cigarette but tasting delicious cooking or funny conversations with friends or family. Their smoking time prevents us from enjoying those pleasure. When we were in restaurants, we had better enjoy the atmosphere in restaurants as much as we can.And so, I think they should not smoke in restaurants  
Å@I agree with this opinion because of some reasons.  Å@First, it is bad for many peopleÅfs health to smoke at restaurants. Recent studies show that smoke which near-smokers people snuff has more poisonous chemicals than smoke which is inhaled by smokers. Not only persons who sit at table with a smoker but also another customers will suffer passive smoking, even if one smokes at the restaurants.  Å@Second, if restaurantÅfs owners allow smoking, they will suffer a loss. Do you want to eat with smoking people? Of course, you will say ÅgNoÅh, because tobacco fumes spoil delicious foods. If tobacco fumes make some guests unpleasant at a restaurants, they wonÅft want to visit there again. And, if restaurants have smoking space, they must also have devices to air and to prevent from firing. But these systems cause restaurantÅfs owners economic burdens. In other words, it is not profitable for them to exist smokers at restaurants.  Å@Finally, paradoxically, it is smokers who get advantage to be excluded from restaurants. If the places where they can smoke decrease, they have to bother to find smoking space when they want to smoke. People who feel it troublesome may begin to stop smoking. Moreover, it will be one of the good prompt for persons who want to break them habit of smoking but canÅft to exclude smokers from restaurants.  Å@Because of above three reasons, we can know that prohibiting smoking at restaurants is good for smokers, other customers and restaurantÅfs owners. So, I think that smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan 
Cigarettes have bad smell. Because of it, someone who hates it feel bad.  In that situation, they can not have meals with joy, happiness and so on.   And cigarettes do more harm than good. Their smokes ruin not only smokers' health but also nonsmokers'.  Then, what can we do for this problem? Should we ban those who smoke in restaurant?  I do not think so. Smoking should not be completely banned.  I think that those who smoke and don't smoke have to be separated. They have to be placed different place. They have to have meals in different place.  The reason why I have such an opinion is the following.  Those who smoke have a right of smoking, in the same way, those who do not smoke have a right to avoid smoking. Their rights are to be protected at the same time.  To achieve it, we have to separate them.  The managers of restaurants have to make seats for smoker and nonsmoker. This is one of the ways to achieve it.   The core of my opinion is their coexisting. Smoking is not forbidden. On the contrary, it is allowed. I just restrict it for their coexisting. I choose not eliminating but coexisting.   
   Banning from smoking at all the restaurants in Japan is the very nice policy for non smoking people, I think. Smoking in public often makes other peopleÅfs health bad. Of course, a person who smokes well has very bad health, too.   Precisely, why are there many people who smoke well? I have not the answer. I think that smoking has not any good point. However many people like smoking. May be, it is because of taste. For instance, drinking alcohol is with each taste, too. Drinking does not give other people big trouble. So I think it need not be banned from drinking. But, smoking is different from it. Smoking usually gives other people trouble. For instance, they are other peopleÅfs health, mind, and visual. This is a very big problem. Extremely saying, it can have done not to trouble other people, but it must not have done to trouble other people. This is the only one thing that I want to insist.                Today, there are many restaurants which have the role of smoking in Japan. But, I want more. I really want all the restaurants in Japan to ban from smoking or have harder role. And people should not smoke not only in public as a restaurant, but also anywhere.  
I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants not only in Japan but also all over the world. And in the first place I believe that tobacco do not have to be made anywhere because tobacco contain a large number of poison only.  Basically those who hate anyoneÅfs smoking nearby are everywhere. Personally I dislike smoking, too. We can decrease People are made feel unpleasant by smoking. This can make by smokersÅf enduring smoking. Smokers can endure smoking, but those donÅft smoke canÅft get smokers not to smoke. So we need smokersÅf will that smokers donÅft cause any trouble, if smokers want smoking not to be banned at restaurant or other public space.  TobaccoÅfs smokes have a bunch of poison.  And that someone smoke is the fact there are many passive smoker. This seems that smoker spread some poison. If one murders the other by poison, he must be punished. However at least there are people who caused illness or killed by passive smoking. Therefore I suppose that smokers have to be punished. So of course smoking in any restaurant must be banned.  So I agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan. 
I think that smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. It is fact that many people donÅft like smoke of tobacco and donÅft want to be by the smoker. So, smoke of tobacco causes heavy damage not only to the smoker but also to people in surroundings. Nicotine and tar are very poisonous. People donÅft need not to smoke. But smoking should not be ÅgcompletelyÅh banned at all the restaurants, because all the restaurants become unpleasant places for the smoker. People fill the desire of some level by eating. In such a meaning, all the restaurants are not only a place to eat. However, if smoking is banned at all the restaurants, the smoker is uncomfortable and dissatisfied. It is the best that no one smokes, but since tobacco exists in this world, it is impossible. The opinion of people who doesnÅft smoke should be insisted, but the opinion of the smoker should be insisted, too. So that all the people who use a restaurant are comfortable, if smoking room and not smoking room are separated, there is no problem.  So, I think that smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. 
Tabacco contains so many sorts of poison. For instance, nikotin is most famous poison of them. So Smoking is not good for manÅfs health. If smoking gives only smokers bad effects, people should be allowed to smoke at the public situation, for example restaurants, offices, schools and even trains. But actually, it harms not only smoking people but also many other non-smoking people around them. In other word, many people who do not smoke may be suffered from a lot of smokeÅfs bad effects. It is so terrible story that non-smoking man is died of cancer because he had been with heavy smokers. In particularly, at the public space such as restaurants, there are many kinds of people, not to say, there are babies, young children and older. They are so to speak people who are likely to be affected by the situation around them. It never happen that younger people who have many wonderful futures are made to abandon them due to smoking bad effects. Thus, it is not too much to say that smoking at the public space is equal to murder. Those who hope to smoke should go other place, where non-smoking people are not to be found, and they will smoke calmly without being said complaints. 
Today, smoking is banned at most places. This is the reason why people became regard smoking as harmful and annoyance recently. Certainly, smoke of smoking do harm to your and otherÅfs body, and heating cigarettes cause by fire and burn, and some people throw their cigarettes on the road, river and so on. Most people hope not to smoke exclude in specific spaces. To buy cigarettes and smoking is to buy and throw about poison and to burn your money by yourself. If you smoke, your family and your friend must not feel comfortable. Similarly, people hate smoke and odor. Especially, in the restaurants, cleanness is lost and people cannot enjoy a dinner by your smoking. Nobody want to eat a dinner in place where is smoky and bad-smelling. Looks and smells of dishes are important to enjoy dinner. In the restaurants, you can enjoy not only eating but also talking with your family, friends and colleagues. The smell is not spices or sources but nicotine and the smoke make you cough and your eyes are sore and eventually you cannot concentrate on your eating and talking. Thus, you cannot have a nice time in the restaurants. Above all, smoking when you eat is bad manners. Smoking must be banned in places not only of eating but also where smoking makes a lot of people annoying.     
There are many arguments for and against smoking in restaurants  But smoking shouldnÅft be permitted in restaurants.  A restaurant is a place everyone eats dish comfortably.  So the manager must offer everybody pleasant surroundings.  If a person smokes, another person near him will mind it and not eat deliciously.  Some persons may be unwilling to see a smoking people.  If the family eats dishes, the child is exposed to smoke.  In the parentsÅf position it is the worst situation.  If he wants to smoke, he has to go and smoke another place.  There is the way nonsmoking seats are set too.  But it is an only flattering unction.  Before all things smoke is bad for our health.  Smoking increases possibilities of pneumonia and cancer.  The diseases may lead them to death.   Smoking effects on not only a smoking person but also another person near him.  It is even said a passive smoking person is worse for the health than a smoking person.  In addition, if a customer smells smoke in a restaurant, the restaurant does its reputation no good.  The customer never come to the restaurant.  Restaurants must provide everyone with the place customers eat dishes comfortably.  So smoking must be prohibited in the restaurant.      
In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at the restaurant in Japan. The reason why I think so is that smoking is bad for health and if someone smokes not only themselves but also surrounding cause damage. If someone smokes near our place, we damage more than the person who smoke. Furthermore, there are a lot of children in restaurant. If the children breathe the smoke, the suffering is not only harmful for health, but also crimping the growth of them. We must protect them from the threat of smoking.    According to the statistics, the person who is smoking is much more likely to have cancer of the lung than the person who is not smoking. Thus, smoking has no advantage and a lot of disadvantage. But in Japan, there are a lot of places which allow people to smoke. It is hard for the person who is not smoking. We must decrease the number of those places. So we should prohibit smoking at the restaurant as one part of decreasing the number of smoking place. It is hard to prohibit smoking all the places but we can gradually decrease such the place.   In this way, to prohibit smoking at the restaurant protects the person who is not smoking from the threat of smoking.  
Nowadays, in Japan, smoking has come to be controlled gradually. For instance, a less than 20-years-old young people cannot buy a cigarette with vending machine without ÅeTASPOÅf. In addition, smoking has come to be banned at some places. Those are only because smoking makes your health worth. So it is also natural that smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.     For other reason, a restaurant is a place where enjoys cooking and is not the place where enjoys smoking. The main purpose of go to a restaurant is eating a delicious dish. However, not only you but also one of the surroundings will surely think that the taste of the dish is unsavory if you were smoking when you go to a restaurant. These days, in some restaurants, a smoking seat and a nonsmoking seat are separated. However a person who do not smoking may be guided in a smoking seat if the restaurant was crowded. If it becomes so, the person will become a very unpleasant feeling.       If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan, everyone could enjoy a meal. Those who want to surely smoke should just smoke outside a store after having a meal.
I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the   restaurants in Japan.   I have two reasons to the opinion.   First, smoking in the public space is too danger.   Because, a cigarette brings us bad effect.   My boyfriend has a asthma. When he absorbs much cigarette   smoke, he can has a spasm. In the worst case, he can die. I   think that you should know a existence of such a person. Smoking  is a very danger for such a person.   To be sure, some people want to smoke after dinner. But, it is a  matter of life and death for other people. I want some people who want to  smoke after dinner to go to a smoking space or go out and smoke.   And, a cigarette injures all of us. ItÅfs not so good to the public.   Second, it has bad smell.   My mother is smoker. But she always says when we go to a restaurant,  ÅgOur dishes become a bad taste because of a smoking smell.Åh Even smoker  donÅft like a smoking smell ! Of cause, I also dislike the smell. Restaurant  is a eating space. Not smoking space.   ThatÅfs way I consider that smoking at the restaurants is bad. And, it should  be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  
I think that it is not good ideas.  Nowadays, cigarettes are said that bad items for smokers and people who are surround them. Certainly, it causes cancer and a lot of disease. So a lot of people think that smoking is very unhealthy. But when people smoke, they feel happy, ecstasy and a sense of sin. I think that smokers do not think cigarettes are bad, and understand that others feel unhappy about smoking. So I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I propose that the restaurants should divide more certainly between a smoking room and a not smoking room. Now they are same floor in the restaurants. It is bad. For example one floor is all smoking, another is all not smoking. And they make a strong wall between smoking and not smoking. If they are able to do it, smoker and not smoker enjoy their dinner each other. If restaurants ban smoking, they will not have pleas at eating in the world. and restaurants can not earn an income. They have better not to ban smoking or to work out countermeasures. So I do not think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
I am opposite to the complete prohibition of smoking at a restaurant. Recently, I think that the second hand smoke hardly influences it of most because it has delimited the smoking seat and the no-smoking zone at a restaurant. It is ..right to spend.. certain in a surrounding guest from the restaurant to the guest the smoker though it is thought that it troubles because it takes in the second hand smoke and the smell, etc. comfortable in the store the reason to prohibit inside of a store smoking the restaurant otherwise, the restaurant side will select the guest.  However, if it is usual "Restaurant" at any rate in case of the tavern, I think that it should refrain from smoking a little. It is necessary to refrain from smoking that exerts a lot of guests of the child taking are in the restaurant, and a bad influence for such a child in no small way as adult manners. Limiting or prohibiting smoking with the restaurant in such a meaning might have the meaning. I think that thinking about the balance of the person who wants to spend restaurant meals comfortably and the person who should defend from the second hand smoke by smoking is important. 
I donÅft agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in Japan. I think it shouldnÅft ban completely smoking in restaurant in Japan. Smoking is not banned in Japan. People have a right to smoke.  I have a friend who smokes. He sometimes looks very hard when he need to smoke. It means smokers have a time when they must need to smoke. So sometimes smokers have a time when they must smoke in a restaurant. So we can't ban to smoke. But I always think it is too bad if there is a person who smokes next chaire. When we eat, smell of tobacco brake the mood and make foods bad. So we should separate the space where who smoke use and who donÅft smoke use, I think. It is easy thought and very good for each other who smoke and who donÅft smoke. And I, donÅft smoke, think it is very serious problem whether can smoke in the restaurant or cannot smoke in the restaurant for smoker. So we shouldnÅft ban to smoke in the restaurant. We should separate the space where who smoke use and who donÅft smoke use I think.
I am opposite to the opinion. Because there is a person who wants smoking when eating in the restaurants. Recently, I think that there are many things banned for smoking people. For the our body, smoking may harmful but I think that the people who want to smoke the cigarette can smoking. I think the most important thing is to separate the smoking people and the non smoking people. It is necessary to have manners both smoking people and non smoking people. I think that it is necessary to prevent smoke from going to the non smoking people, especially children and pregnant woman. If the smoke go to them, smoking people should be endured to smoke the cigarette. When the people want smoking without careful in the restaurants, they can go to the free-smoking restaurants now. I think that everyone has the right to enjoy in the restaurants. If everyone keep a little manners, we will have a enjoy time in the restaurants. The trend of ban the smoking is risen for the health, but I think that the side of restaurants also should consider the customer for separate the smoke. Non smoking people donÅft complain of smoking if the smoke donÅft come. In such a reason, I am opposite to the opinion that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan. 
I think it is important for collage students to have a part-time job.   I am twenty years old. Many people of the same age as me work and earn salary or keep house. Some of them even have their children and take care of them. However, I live by using money my father earns and by eating what my mother cooks, so I think I should make my allowance at least.  When I was a high school student, I belonged to Wander Vogel club.  The club camps all over Japan, so I needed much money.  Because I wanted to make money for it by myself, I decided to have a part-time job. I was busy because I should study hard too. I wanted to leave it whenever I was told off. But the experience taught me how severe working is and grew up me very much.  Now, I teach junior high school and high school students in their home. Some of them donÅft do homework or donÅft understand what I say. It bothers me, but I enjoy my job thinking how to teach or how to keep their motivation, and I want to keep this job.  I think to have a part-time job has mean more than earn money. 
I think that the part-time job is important for college students. Actually, I am working part-time now. For, to the first, I want to earn money for the club activity. Differing from the high school student, the club activity becomes real at the university. Additionally, the scale of the club activity is large, and there are a lot of people in the circle. The large scale costs money for club activity. And money is necessary to play with them. But, I do not think that it wants parents to pay for that money. I am unpleasant in parents' paying for money that is needed for me to do what I want to do. And secondarily, there is reason that I want to buy what I want to. Differing from high school student, the price of the thing that I want is high when becoming a university student. But I do not think that I want my parents to pay for money of these things, too. And I want to save up money and to buy my wanting things for myself. Certainly, there is an opinion that you should study hard without working when you are student. And you borrow money from parents now, and when starting your adult life, it only has to return. But I think that there is something of experience that can be done only by this age now. After I have found employment once, I think that it is not possible to work part-time at all. It is bad that the part-time job becomes a main theme at the student life. But I think the part-time job is necessary if it becomes a method of obtaining money that is needed to do what I want to.  
I think it is important for collage students to have a part-time job. Most of students require money for playing, club activity, shopping, eating, and so on. I think we should earn the money we use ourselves because we soon or already twenty years old. We rely on our parents for a long time, we should independent. I think, to earn myself is a first step to independent. After graduate collage, we start to live as a member of society. To have a part-time job and earn money is training of it. Studying at collage is most important for our students, but we canÅft learn all things at collage. Part-time job is a place of social study, I think. We can learn social environment, economy and person relationship through part-time job. And we can experience many things in society. Also, we can work our favorite job. These experiences can be useful when we find employment in the future. Moreover, through part-time job, we can meet many people. So we can get many friends and extend our world. Collage students have a lot of time. So we should spend this time significant. Through part-time job, we can get money and good experience. To have and work a part-time job is very good way, I think.  
I agree with the following statement, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are two reasons about my opinion.  First, I think that it is important to make money for myself. I become college student and I gradually buy many things. So, I need much money but if I donÅft have part-time job, I canÅft buy any things. To buy wanted things, I must have a part-time job. And I think that this my opinion apply many people, so many people need a part-time job. Many students have little money. Second, part-time job is good experience. This experience is very useful for oneself. For example, teacher for a junior high school student is useful for teaching things. Hall staff is useful for communication with other people. Kitchen staff is useful for cooking. These experiences are important and valuable for college student when one work. If I donÅft experience part-time job, I will be foolish people when I get work. So I want to experience part-time job. This experience is not loss for all the world. And you can get a close friend in part-time job. I got good friends too. When you make friends, part-time job is joyful!    
I agree with the following statement ÅeÅfIt is important for college students to have a part-time job.ÅfÅf  I have some reasons why I agree with this statement. First of all, to have a part-time job teaches us the real value and importance of money. Before I started a part-time job, I got some money off my mother and my ground mother. And I bought books and clothes I wanted with the money. Then I sometimes bought something I didnÅft really need. But after I started a part-time job, I came to buy something I really needed carefully. For I learned how hard earning money was. I felt the money I earned by myself was very valuable. Secondly, to have a part-time job gives me a lot of experiences. I work as a part-time teacher. And I teach not only junior high school students but also primary school and high school students. Other part-time teachers are many kinds of peoples. They are college students, women who have children and men who got married. Therefore I communicate with many kinds of people. And I learn wide views from them because they have their own views different from mine. Thirdly to have a part-time job improve the way how to use limited times. I must do many thing-studying, listening to rock music, reading books, housekeeping, communicating with my family, and a part time job. So I came to plan by myself. And I always do something I must do now. For these reasons I agree with the following statement ÅeÅfIt is important for college students to have a part-time job.ÅfÅf And IÅfll have many kinds of part-time jobs from now on.
 I agree with the statement. I think that it is too early for high school students to do, but that it is just good time for college students to do. I have some reasons I think so.  First, they need to earn money to play and to date alone. I think some of them are given money by their parents, but we must be independent from their parents soon. When we graduate from university, we must work, earn, and make on living. So, it is learning that we have a part-time job.   Second, to have a part-time job is an opportunity to know many persons. Actually, I make some friends through a part-time job. Some goes to Kobe University, other goes to different university. If I donÅft have the part-time job, I never encounter them. It is very fun to know with persons who go to different university. And it is very fun to know with person who is different years. Especially, I think I learn many things, when I talk with adults.   Each person has different thought, so it is important to know many persons and to talk with them. Such an opportunity is just to have a part-time job. Therefore, I think college students should have different part-time job so that we experience. 
I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job for four reasons.  First, you can experience everything we need for the future through working. It is sometimes too hard for you to continue. But knowledge and experiences you get through working will be helpful when you go into the society.   Second, you can get money. It is essential for your life. Nobody can do without it. When you get it after hard working, you will know the importance of money through getting it by yourself. Perhaps you may come to stop wasting money. Third, you can be conscious of being no longer a child. And you can feel how graceful your parents are. If you have never thought your parentÅfs troubles, it will be a chance to think of them.  Finally, you can come to know many people. Some of them much elder and others are younger than you. You can work with them and make friends with them. The friends may advise you how to live and what to do when you are in trouble.  Anyway, you can broaden your sight and learn to think deeply more than when you have only friends usually around yourself. Of course you must study as a college student. And even if you are still a college student, you must work seriously as long as you decide to do the job. But mistakes will strengthen you by getting through it many times. You can practice working before you go into the society. So I think it important to do a part-time job. 
 I agree with this statement. I think college student should have a part-time job. Then, I want to express why I agree.  First, college students need a lot of money, because they have many things to do. For example, to live alone far from family, to study abroad, to take part in a club and so on. In addition, they also spend much money on only learning in college. In order not to depend too much on their parents, they should have a part-time job and get some money.   Second, by having a part-time job, they will be able to get not only money but also important things. They will be able to make new human relationships and get some new skills. Those things will surely help them when they are in trouble.  Finally, if now they can learn how to work and how to earn money, they will be able to work smoothly when they get a job. Almost all of college students will start some job after graduate college, but some of them will fail in something and worry about the failure. But if they had experienced similar situations before, they will be sure to get through the difficulty. To have a part-time job is very useful for them.  Since, I think, to have a part-time job is very important for college student. Actually I have a part-time job now, and I get some money and learn many things. I want to make good use of what I learn from a part-time job. 
I agree with this opinion ÅgIt is important for college students to have a part-time jobÅh. I think it is important to gain social experience by a part-time job. Because, many college students have lived in the limited relation of people that is called school. They donÅft know the large relations of people in the society. In it, there are many kinds of people. For example, people who help them or interfere them. In the school, if they think they donÅft like some people, they can avoid that one. But in the society, there are some cases that they canÅft avoid someone who they donÅft like. They can know it by a part-time job. I also think they can know the importance of money by having a part-time job. They have been given money from their parents. They donÅft know how hard earning money is. So they sometimes waste money. If they have a part-time job, they can know it is hard to earn money by working. If they know this, they decrease the frequency of wasting money and they can know the troubles of their parents on working. They respect their parents. I agree with this statement according to that two reason. 
I think that the part-time job plays the important part of college studentsÅf lives, so it is necessary for them. IÅfll write why I think so . Firstly, students can know the system of the society that they live in through the job. Nowadays, it becomes the social problem that a lot of people give up their jobs in few years. Of course, the reasons why they gave up their jobs are valuables, but there could be some people who are not able to be used to working. Though working is the one of the obligations of Japanese, those who got used to living the rich lives without working are tend not to continue their jobs. If they could know the mean of working through the part-time job, they would continue their jobs.  Secondly, the part-time jobs give students a kind of confidence because they are given their own part, whatever they are big or small, in their workplaces. It is like club or circleÅfs activity, but the part-time job is unique at the point that those who are various age or social standpoint need them.  That is why I think that the part-time job is necessary for the college students. Of course, some people say that it is ridiculous for students to work for little money neglecting their duty ÅeÅfstudyingÅfÅf. However, I think college students do various things that they can do only in this time. 
First, I agree with the statement Ågit is important for college students to have a part-time jobÅh The act of earning money by working would make you feel a satisfaction that you can act as a member of the society. And whenever you do a part-time job, you may have partners. I think it a precious experience to work hard to contribute to your office by cooperating with your partners. But, the most significant reason I agree to a part-time job for is an economical point. When you become a college student, you will need more money than before. Of course, the expense includes tuition fee and the cost of living. And the expense also includes the cost spared for your hobby and play and so on. I think, it is wrong for you to plead with your parents to pay for such expenses. You should earn the money that spared for your hobby and play and so on. So I agree to a part-time job to a great degree. And in fact, many college students have a part-time job, and I also have it. But it is the part of a college student to study. You should not forget it.  
I agree with the statement, because we can learn a lot of things in working part-time.  First, we can see how hard we survive in our society. Working every day is very hard. And we encounter a variety of difficult about working itself, human relations in the office, binding ourselves by work and so on. When we graduate from our college, we will start to work. We canÅft live without effort and difficult.  Second, we can earn. ItÅfs no wonder, but itÅfs very important. If we had no money, we could buy nothing. It means that we canÅft have any house, any food and any clothes. We canÅft live without money.  Lastly, we can make good human relations. We live with a lot of people and they help us or we do them. And we often have to get along with difficult people. None can live alone, so itÅfs quite important in our life. So I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have actually learned the above things in working. I want to continue working unless it gives bad effect for my everyday study.  
I disagree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  In Japan, a lot of college students have a part-time job. For example, they work as a waiter, a casher and a teacher of a cram school. There are many kinds of works that need people like college students as a worker. It is because they have a lot of time to use freely and they can be hired cheaply. But it is just a fact of today. We tend to think popular things are right but I donÅft think so. Why are college students given a lot of time to use freely? I think, it is for a time doing what they canÅft do except now, not for a time earning money. It is sure to need much money for playing with friends but if they spend a lot of their time to earn money, it misplaces its priorities. Earning money is not bad thing, but neither is the most important thing. College students should spend more time reading many books, visiting many places and communicating someone.  From these reasons, I donÅft think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. 
I agree with this following statement. Actually, I have two part-time job, restaurant and Kateikyousi. If I did not have a part-time job, I could not live by myself. I have two reasons. The one reason is that my parents spent a lot of money helping me to enter the college I wanted to study in. In addition, I borrow a room in Kobe because it is impossible to go to school from Wakayama, my country. It also costs very much money. I donÅft want to bother my parents any more. So, I agree with having a part-time job, rather I think that we should have a part-time job. Today we have scholarship system. By this system, a lot of students pay their own cost for college from their earnings. Of course I use this system, too. The other reason is that we can get many abilities, experiences and so on. If we know only things which we learned in our college, we will not be useful when we will graduate from our college and start to work. I do not want to be that person! Everybody has to think so. I agree with having a part-time job, and I recommend my Kouhai to have a part-time job. I want a lot of student to agree with my opinion. 
I agree this opinion.  I think general college students should have a part-time job in order to get a lot of their life experience. By having part-time jobs, they can get skills to communicate with a variety of people, to do special task, and so on.  However, this doesnÅft always apply to me. I have three part-time jobs ( home teacher,ÅhjyukuÅh teacher, and horse racing course employee). But, money that I got at racing course is not mine. It will be used for our horses. (I am a member of horse riding club, so we must work for our horses besides club dues.) Surely, I could learn a lot of things by working there for a year.  Teaching junior high school students and high school students is good review of our studying and I can know how difficult teaching other people is. And I could learn about horsesÅf cure at racing course. (I work at horsesÅf clinic in racing course with animal doctor.)  But, because I work five times a week, I myself lost time for spending a happy week-end dinner with family and studying chemistry and English.   That is why I said Ågthis doesnÅft always apply to meÅh. 
      A partÅ|time job is loved by many people ,especially by university student.Å@Passing an entrance exam , I looked forÅ@a part-time job .Since then I have done double work, andÅ@Å@ sometimes  even depend on the job which need us to work one day alone. Now I`m looking for another job which is higher wage.       The main  purpose of having part- time job is usually  to earn  a  lot of money to use freely ,buying cloth, eating  lunch  etc. But many students engage in a club activity.And many students need to spend a lot ofÅ@money there. I belongs to dance club in Kobe univ. In the club ,we obliged to take part in competition, and we have to spend too much money.for example ,fare ,entry fee,and the money to drink with all the member every time.the money,therefore , vanish from hand to hand at the moment.        When  I was child , my mother and her friend said to me "ALL students have to do is studying hard ".Of course Ithink so too.  So  ,instead of me ,my parent pay school expences. I don`t have to earn the expences.  I am able to go to university to study a lot. But  I think now it is time to  be independent to some extent !  This is most important study for the university students. Through the part-timejob ,  for the purpose of  doing  or going on  what I want to do ,play ,club  activity,..etc, we have to work, sometimes involved in some trouble. At last, we can get money.        it is vital  for us to have part-time job. Having part time job is filled with the elements of society , and we can get someting to survive all by myselfÅDÅ@Å@Å@Å@Å@ 
I do not think that to have a part-time job is important for college students. You have to, because students have to study hard to grant dream to them. If students waste many times to work part-time job, they do not have enough time to study. It might cause failure to grant dream. It is foolish. Why do they go to college? Is StudentÅfs duty working part-time job? No. StudentÅfs duty is study. Students must not forget it.  Also, StudentÅfs parents work hard everyday to get school expense. Do parents hope that their children work part-time many times and lose time to study? It is impossible. Parents hope their children study hard. If parents pay school expense to college, children have to hear their hope and study hard. But, some students need money for club activity and buying textbook. If they do not have enough money for school life, they need to have a part-time job. When students work part-time job to get money, they have to take care that they do not waste many times. It is important to balance working part-time job with studying. There are reasons why I think ÅgA part-time job is not important for college studentsÅh. But, I have one more the reason. I can not work and study at once, so I envy the man who can work and study at once. It is another reason why I think part-time job isnÅft important for students. 
I agree that it is important for collage students to have a part-time job. I have two reasons I think so.  One reason is to be able to understand the worth of money. Collage students have much time they can do various things. But they require money when they do something. So, they need to earn money. They have many methods to earn money. In them, to have a part-time job is the simplest method. Students work for the certain time. Then, they take the certain money. It is very simple and they surely get money. And they can learn the difficulty that they earn it. I think they thank to their parents who have earned money for them. It is very good.  Another reason is that collage students can experience a society. Most of them will graduate their collage and work somewhere for the future. But they will not be able to work suddenly. So, they have a part-time job and can see working. If they do that, they can talk with people who actually work at a society and listen to their experiences. Also, they can experience the severe of a society. They are scolded to do wrong things. When they too wrong thing, they must quit the job. Collage students experience a society like that, and they will have fewer problems when they work.  Collage students have to study. I think this must be neglected. So, I want to say it is important to have a part-time job for proper time. 
I agree it is important for college students to have a part time job. Some people will say that purpose of college students is ÅgstudyÅh. I agree with this opinion, however, I think that Ågvarious experiencesÅh is purpose of college students too.   Firstly, I think that college students can experience work by doing part time job. After college students graduate from the college, they have to work. Therefore, I think that the experience of doing part time job is important.  Secondly, I think that it is important for college students to experience of traveling various places and play with friends and etc however, those experiences need a lot of money. Then, it is necessary to do the part-time so that college students earn the money.  Thirdly, I think that college students can meet various and many people through the part time job. It is important for college students to communicate with other college students and people of society.  For these reasons, I agree it is important for college students to have a part time job. 
  I think that it isnÅft important for college students to have a part time job. There are some reasons. First, college students must save time for studying. The time for studying is not only time for college study but also time for getting qualifications. Those days, it is very important for us to get qualifications in college. It is because that having qualifications is advantage to do everything in our future. And, to get qualifications is so hard. In my case, I must study for 9 hours in one day to get accountant qualification. Second, we must work after graduating college. So we should prepare something for the time. For example, getting qualifications, strength, and so on. Thirdly, part time jobÅfs skills are useless in many cases in our future. For example, for many people, cashiers skills are useless in their future. These are my reasons why it isnÅft important for college students to have a part-time job. It is sure that we can get something if we have a part-time job. But, it is more important for us to prepare for our future. So I disagree that college students have a part time job. We should study hard in college and in double school.
  I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Having a part-time job may help students to choose job in the future. And we can meet new colleague, such as college student, elderly people, and high school student.  We can experience some kind of part-time jobs, and learn the difficulty of getting money. In fact IÅfm working at restaurant near Rokkomichi. I have worked there for half a year. It is a first time for me to work. I can know how to service and its difficulty. Sometimes it is hard for me but I enjoy working and servicing. I think it is very important for me to have part-time job. I want to encourage college students who donÅft have part-time job to have it. But we must make much of study, and a part-time job must not prevent us from studying. We should have a part-time job as far as we can. Since I have had my part-time job, I have come to live actively. A part-time job can not only give us money but also give us motivation for our daily life. Having a part-time job is a very valuable experience in college life. So I agree that college students have a part-time job. 
I agree this statement. There are two reasons about that. One reason is that college students need a lot of money for campus life, group activities and club activities. There are a lot of people in the University. So they have a lot of friends and they often play with them by spending money. And in the University, there are no school uniforms. So they care their clothes, and buy a lot of clothes. And a monthly club expenses, camp expenses and drinking party expenses are too high for college students to pay without working part-time. And school expenses, travel expenses and prices of textbooks are very high, too. So college students should do part-time job to reduce their parentsÅf pays. Another reason is that to do part-time job is a good opportunity of experiencing communities. By doing part-time job, they can know hardness of earning money, and need of patience. That will have them contacting with other part-timers gently. And that will be useful to look for work in the near future. Today, college students are called for rich experience more than school background. By such reasons, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
I think that it is important for college students to have a part time job. Because we can get many things if we have a part time job. Firstly, we can get money. College students need much money for life. But we canÅft receive all money from parents. We realize that earning money is not easy when we work hard. And we come to cherish money. Secondly we can see the world we didnÅft see before. We must work for many guests. And we realize that we can live thanks to many people and come to appreciate their work. Thirdly we come to cooperate with a variety of people. There are many kinds of people in the work. We are different from them in many ways. And working with them is very difficult. But we can grow if we overcome this trouble. cooperation is very important for the future. Thus we come to do many things and we grow. Before we become a member of society, we can experience working. This will be useful for our future.
First of all, I agree this statement, namely I think it is important for us to have a part-time job. There are three reasons why I think so. Firstly, a part-time job is a chance to get money that I can use freely. Now, I live in Rokko by myself and my parents send regular money to me once a month. I spend that money in living. The rest of that money is not so much. So I do not buy anything I like anytime. In short, we college students need money. Secondly, to do a part-time job is to join in a part of society indirectly, I think. When we graduate from this university after few years, we have to work in a complex society. Then, the more we have experience in a part-time job, the better we are. Thirdly, to do a part-time job is to get a chance making friends with. It is easy to making friends with by working together. In conclusion, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. 
I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.      There are a variety of part-time jobs. After graduating from college, college students work. So, by experiencing part-time jobs during campus life, they can prepare for work after graduating from college and know how work they are suited for.  Also, by getting money as pay of work, they appreciate the value of money and difficulty with work. In my case, I have a part-time job to teach junior high school students math. Through a part-time job, teaching someone something became one of my options of work in the future. And I appreciated the value of money and difficulty with work. The feeling I thanked for my parents working to grow me grew up.       I have another reason why I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Because I think college students should earn money to spend on their hobbies and play by having a part-time job. I live with my parents. But I don't be given spending money and earn money for myself needed for play and baseball club activities I belong to.       From these reasons, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. 
I agree with the statement. This is because college students can get much ability for life and find a job that makes the best oh their ability by doing various kinds of part-time jobs. First, they can learn how to communicate with people, especially older persons. When they were students in junior high and high school, they may have had the relationship with the seniors. So they may be able to keep company with the older persons well. But I think the relation will not be accepted in society. In addition, by having a part-time job, they talk with many people without regard to age or sex and gain much experience and knowledge. Second, they can obtain a sense of responsibility. When they were students, they can be absent from school easily. But if they go out into the society, they canÅft do so.   Third, they can earn money by themselves. By that, they understand the importance of money and the difficulty of earning money. As for me, before having a part-time job, I sometimes waste money on impulse buying. But after that, I want to save money that I earn by myself, so I canÅft buy things easily. As a result, I can obtain a sense of the value of money. Therefore, I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. 
I agree with the statement: It is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have three reasons about this. First, a part-time job gives me relationships with different people. In fact, I made a best friend at my part-time job. And there are people of all ages. I enjoy talking with my senior. I can get many ways of thinking. College students will rarely have a chance to meet many people of all ages at only the college. Second, I can learn not only content of the job but also the basic manner. I think itÅfs very necessary. This manner what I learned in my job will be useful in future. For example, I learned honorific, service for customers, and so on. These are very difficult, but IÅfm happy to learn it now. I think that a part-time job is the first step for going out into the world. Third, I could thank my parents. I learned that job is very hard and that money is important. If I didnÅft have a part-time job, I would not have noticed that. Now IÅfm using the money with thinking well.   These are my main reasons. I think that we should have a part-time job, so I want to go on with my part-time job. And I want to learn many things. ThatÅfs all. Thank you for reading. 
I agree with this idea. There are three reasons why I think itÅfs important for college students to have a part-time job.      Firstly, you should think every student from poor to rich. It cost about \1,200,000 a year to spend a campus life. So I think itÅfs hard for the parents to make that money. Especially, economic statement is not so good in this age. So I think many students donÅft have enough money. And they have to earn money for their lives.       Secondly, college students must enjoy their free time. As you know, students have much time to enjoy something. For example, trip, karaoke, club activity, party and so on. And each leisure cost a lot of money. In my experience, it cost about \35,000 for my clubÅfs training stay in Nara last summer. I think it too expensive, but it is essential. So it depends, but many poor students must earn money to enjoy club activities.      Thirdly, it gives us a lot of valuable experiences to do a part-time job. For example, importance of patience, to work effectively, teamwork and so on. I work at restaurant. At there, I often warned something and learned something. And I think student grow little by little through that experience.      IÅfd like to say most is it is important to experience a part-time job and experience a real social world. Of course working for life and leisure is important. Some people would say it interrupt studying, but I think part-time job experience is more important than just studying their major.   
I think that it is important for college student to have a part time job. Almost all of college students get the job after their graduation. So, I think that to have some part time jobs is the chance for college students to think about their lifetime jobs. These days, 30% of new members of society graduated a college or university quite their job within three years. Why do they quite their jobs so quickly?  I think that it is due to their no, little, or short thinking about their jobs. Most of the college students start to think and search about their jobs when they are 3rd grade. It is when they have to think about it. But, by working in part time jobs, they can have a chance to start to think about their jobs. To think about their jobs early in their college life is very important. So, they can worry about their job longer, and may have a good idea about their social life. By doing so, it will lead them to good result. In addition, by working in part time jobs, they can touch the society which they will live after graduation. No matter how little they know about the society, it is big difference whether they know about the society or not. And it is far bigger difference whether they can think about their jobs with the knowledge, or not. 
 In my opinion, it is important for college students to have a part-time job.    First, college students can learn our society by working. For example, they learn the way to get money, to communicate with customers and to work with others well. In fact, I had a part-time job and learned so many things, by working. I think these things are useful after I graduate.    Second, they pay a lot of money to their colleges and most of them is helped by their parents. But they spend a lot of money playing with their friends, buying things they want and traveling with their friends. This is very important so they should do so. But they should get money to play themselves. In fact, I get money for playing myself. I think it is natural and I should do so.     Third, college students have a lot of time and energy. Their 150work is very valuable and give energy for society.     I think It have many merits for college student to work and they should have a part-time job for their parents and themselves. In consequence, I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. 
I agree this statement. Because I think it is important for college students to make money and to experience a part time job. In fact, I have a part-time job at restaurant in Osaka. As my home is too far from Kobe University to go to school, I live in Kobe alone. So, I need a lot of money to live. And I belong to a club, so I need some money for it. And now I have a lot of time, so I want to different places and but many clothes, and get the license to drive a car. But thanks to the part-time job, I have money enough to live. IÅfm given some money by my parents, but the money isnÅft enough to live, and I donÅft depend on my parents very much.            Then, thanks to a part-time job we can many things. For example, thanks to the part-time job I was able to learn how to communicate with visitors and to cook. Then I made friends there, and they donÅft go to college or go to an expert school or work the restaurant as an employee. They are very different from me in the meaning of these, so I was able to learn many things I donÅft have from them. I think in university I canÅft   learn these things, so this experience was very worth for me.        So, I think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. 
 I agree with the statement, ÅgIt is important for collage students to have a part-time job.Åh I have two big reasons. I think about it recently, too. First, it is because I think that we should understand that earning much money is very hard before working in a society. For example, when we are scolded to our boss, we will have angry or feel shock, and we want to quit. But if we quit, we cannot earn much money and we will be in trouble. So we can learn that putting up with anger is important and understand real value of money. And we will think that we use money importantly. Then, we can use much money that we earned without minding. For example, we can watch many movies, travel around the world, go to a high-class restaurant, and buy expensive clothes, shoes, hats, jewels, bags, cosmetics, and so onÅc Second, it is the reason why our human relations spread. In a collage, there are a lot of people. So we can get more friends after entering a collage than before it. But if we have a part-time job, we can spread our human relations more!! These relations help our growth. Therefore, I think that it is important for collage students to have a part-time job.  
Çh agree with an opinion that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are two reasons for that. Firstly, college student need more money at some situation than junior school student. For example, we need money for a membership of something club, going to drink, shopping, and so on. But college students are almost same as members of society. So we should not depend on our parents but pay money that we earned by ourselves. Secondly, we can have a lot of experience through a part-time job. For example, when I was a freshman, I taught mathematics to junior high school student at cram school. I thought that it was difficult to teach anything. I worked at a bar too. I thought it was hard for shy man to meet or talk. But these experiences will help me in future. Most people think that not having a part-time job but studying is more important. I think that the idea is good too. To Study for getting some qualification will help us. But having a part-time job will help us as much as studying. That might be unimportant but useful in something. So Çh agree with an opinion that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. 
 I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are three reasons why I think so.  Firstly, it is because college students need money and take money to do something. For example, they use it when they go somewhere to play with friends, when they buy something such as drinks, household commodities, books, clothes and so on. If some of them belong to clubs, it also often costs them. In fact, I have a part-time job. This is because it costs to buy clothes and to play with friends of mine and I think IÅfll run short of money someday or soon when I donÅft do it.  Secondly, it is because I think having a part-time job is useful for my long-life experience and I may be able to learn something by doing it. Only studying in college is dull. Since I had a part-time job and started, I could increase the sphere of activity, make friends who go to other colleges and exchange information.  Lastly, it is because college students need to get gradually use to having and being conscious of responsibility. When they graduate from college and begin the work in society, they are left the responsible work and carry out their duties. When they go out into the world and begin the work, some may be puzzled because of their inexperience. In order not to be puzzled, it is useful to have a part-time job, I think.  
I agree to this topic. I think that it is very important for college students to have a part time job. It is because I think being a college student means to take a step forward into a social life as an adult. Our parents may pay our school expenses. Yet we are already old enough to earn our own allowances.      First of all, if you have any hobbies you would like to enjoy while you are in college, I think it is your will and responsibility to continue.      Secondly, I think the period of college life is also a training time for us to go into the actual life of workings. And so we would learn what it is like to be working for a company or a shop. I also think it is important for us to experience the hard works to earn money.      Lastly, while we are in college, we will naturally get to the age of twenty when we are treated as an adult person by the society and become legally adult. After then we will be able to smoke, drink, and gamble and so on. But we are at the same time expected to be responsible about our life, living and thoughts. A good example for this would be the public elections we do to participate in governmental deals. And the other example is when you commit a crime your full name will be announced. Therefore, I think that part time jobs during college life would be a good time for us to experience various things and also to learn various things we donÅft learn at school. 
I agree that college students would be better to have a part time job. This is because I have the three following reasons. Firstly, we can have a lot of life by having a part time job, for we can experience many works such as convenience store, bar, and fast food restaurant. Secondly, we, college students, can meet many people and get something out of them. Lastly, we can save much money and then visit lots of countries. These are two merits. One is because I think you had best go to the country where it is spoken in order to master a foreign language. Two is because with much money we can do our own favorite thing during school holidays. I wanted to write more sentences, but I have passed 40 minutes. IÅfm sorry. 
I think it is important to have a part time job. Because most of college students need much money to live and enjoy their life. There are two reasons to think so. First, I think it is difficult for many people to eat what they want to eat, buy what they want without part-time job and do what they want to do. I think college students have to do all things they are interested in. To do everything without afraid will make their life interesting. It is very important. And if we do not part-time job, we do nothing and make no memories. I think it is sad. Second, doing part-time job is good experience to know society. To do part-time job means to get money. It is not easy thing. At school, if there are some problems, for example not to do job to do in class or not to do homework, your teacher or friends help you. But, if you do part-time job, there are difficult problem to solve, only depending on other people is not admitted. We need to think and solve ourself. It is needful skill for everyone. So doing part-time job is important experience to get this skill. I am doing part-time job. Sometime there are hard jobs, but I enjoy it. So I think it is important to have a part time job. 
I agree with this opinion. There are several reasons for this. One is that we need to know about our society. I haven`t worked as a part-time job, so I don`t know about the system of salary. In many senses, we need to get familiar to working as the one of ÅgSHAKAI-JIN,Åh the ordinary workers.  Another is that the important things for college student is not only studying but playing, living by ourselves, and working. We get many things by working. For example, if we work in a restaurant, we learn the difficulties as a server, the tiredness to deal with ill-mannered consumer, and the skill to cook. If you work as a teacher of a prep school, we learn how to teach something to students well, and make ourselves smart. And finally we know the difficulties in our high schools! If we work as an instructor of a sport gym, we can improve our power, body balance, and the skill of communication. The other is that we can improve our skill of communication by working as part-time job. A part-time job is more flexible than a fixed job because we can`t choose the job. In this point, a part-time job is more convenient than a fixed job.  That`s why I think that it`s important for college student to have a part-time job. 
I think itÅfs important for college students to have a part time job.  Firstly, almost all of college students have not enough money. They need more money because they want to play, eat, and buy many book and clothes, so itÅfs important to have a part time job. If they have a part time job, they can get more money they can use freely. Secondly, having a part time job gives students the good experiences. To sell products or to meet various age of people is different from they experience in college. If they get this kind of experience during they are college students, when they get a job after graduate college, this experience will take important roll in the area of their job. Finally, I think new skills they will get if they have a part time job will become a treasure in their life. For example speaking well to many people and working quickly when itÅfs need and so on. These are important skills in their life.  For these reasons, I think itÅfs important for college students to have a part time job and IÅfll get it soon. 
I agree that itÅfs important for college students to have part time job. College students need more money and itsÅf life space expander than high school life before. In entrance season, many welcome parties are held on for new students. So much money is need. But many times senior students pay a lot. In campus life, friends increase more and more. Pleasure needs money in friendship. Not only amusement but also study needs much money. Many college students want to study abroad, but going foreign country is difficult for students on money. In addition, many college textbooks are expensive. And license examinationsÅf cost is high. Many students have and ride bike, but recently gasolineÅfs price is much higher. Therefore I think that college students should have part time job. Of course, studentsÅf duty is learning, shouldnÅft be absorbed in part time job. 
 I  agree  this  opinion; It  is  important  for  students  to  have  a   part-time  job.  There  are  three  reasons.         First,  by  working  by  ourselves,  we  can  learn  the  value  of  money  and  we  become  use  money  more  carefully.  In  fact,  I  have  thought  that  money  is  more  valuable  and  thanked  my  parents  for  giving  me  money  since  I  had  a  part-time  job.         Second,  we  can  learn  to  fit  into  society.  For  example,  how  to  use  a  right  term  of  respect  for  the  person,  ability  of  communication,  and  so  on.  We  cannot  live  in  society  without  these  things.  However,  we  cannot  learn  these  things  by  studying  in  college.         Finally,  it  is  useful  for  us  to  have  a  variety  of  part-time  jobs  when  we  select  our  occupations.  For  example,  I  had  a  part-time  job  of  checking  answer  and  teaching  in  a  clam  school  when  I  was  a  high  school  student.  It  is  very  boring  for  me  because  I  had  to  only  sit  for  a  long  time.  In  addition  to,  sometimes  my  words  are  not  understood  by  students  in  clam  school.  So,  I  knew  I  do  not  suit  the  occupation  as  a  teacher.         Therefore,  I  think  that  it  is  important  for  students  to  have  a  part-time  job. 
 I  agree  that  it  is  important  for  college  students  to  have  a  part-time  job.  Because  we  can  get  a  lot  of  techniques  and  knowledge  through  part-time job.  After  we  get  a  job,  they  sometimes  helpful  to  our  job.   Now,  I  am  working  part-time  in  sushi  shop.  There, Owner usually  says  that  fine  greeting  and  smile  are  very  important.  We  must  think  most  about  guest.  Under  employment,  it  is  not  changed.   Also,  recently  NEET  is  increasing.  I  do  not think  they  are  not  going  to  get  a  job,  but  they  have  anxiety  about  technique  and  knowledge  of  jobs.  They  once  have  a  part-time  job ,  the  anxiety  may  be  cleared.  Therefore  NEET  will  be  decreased.  Decreasing  NEET  is  good  for  future  of  Japan.  So ,  I  think  part-time job  is  good  for  college  students.   In  fact,  through  working  as  part-time job,  I  am  developed.  For  example,  a  year  ago,  I   am  very  shy.  I  could  not  speak  stranger.  But  now  I  am  able  to  speak  stranger  ,of  course  guest.  Also  before  I  begin  part-time  job,  I  did  not  smile  very  much.  But  in  the  sushi  shop  I  forced  smile.  Now  my  smile  has  increased  in  my  daily  life.    Last  reason  is  that  through  part-time  job,  we  can  meet  a lot  of  people.  He  or  she  may  be  best  friend  or  partner  of  our  life.  Talk  with  their,  we  can  get  new  knowledge.    It  is  important  for  college  students  to  have  a  part-time  job  for  these  reason.       
I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Students not to join club activities, especially not to study hard, are bored everyday. If they feel bored, they should work. They lead meaningful lives and get money by working.  In fact, I have not had a part-time job since last November. I am bored everyday. But, I donÅft have too much money to enjoy with my friends.  Recently I feel that I have led useless time. If I allotted those useless time to working, I can buy what I want and enjoy dinner, trip and bowling with my friends.  I think that I can improve myself in new environment. In addition, a part-time job may be useful when we graduate from college. We will understand what kind of thing working and getting money are by a part-time job. And we can make new human relations by a part-time job too.  But I think itÅfs not good that I neglect study by working. So I think the best is proper working. For these reason, I agree with the statement that it is important for students to have a part-time job. And, I want to have a part-time job soon. 
Just now, I donÅft have a part-time job. However, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are some reasons.  First, we need much money during our being students. We have to buy some books for the classes, and pay education money. Especially, if we live alone, we have to pay the money for the apartment and buy foods. We also want to buy the cloths.  Next, a part-time job is social experience. Through a part-time job, we meet a lot of people. So we can learn a lot of things. For example, rules of the society and manner and so on. We can make friends with people who work with, too. We can expand other   human relationship.  Third, we can learn importance of money. When we were high school students, we got some money from our parents. Then, we used the money without thinking of our parentsÅf difficulty of earning the money. So, by working hard and getting the money, we think of importance of the money for the first time. We should be independent of our parents.  That is why, I think itÅfs important to have a part-time job among we are college students. 
I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have two reasons for I think so. One reason is to make money. First, the purpose of having part-time job is to make money. Why college students have part-time job? The reason is something like this. Many college students leave their home town and live alone near the college. It takes too much money for their students. For example, the house rent, the cost of living and so on. Some their parents pay the house rent and sent some money to their child, but it is not enough for the students. So many college students must have part-time job, and make money for them. The other reason is more important. It is to have social experience. Many college students , after graduating from their college ,find employment and work at the company. Before working at the company , to have part-time job during college students. In fact, I have part-time job now. The income is very important and necessary for me. And I could know how important the money is and, how much I have relied on my parents. The experience was very important for me. From such thing I think it is important for college students to have part-time job. 
I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Because I think that it is valuable for college students to have independence at a college. There is a person to live alone in a college student. And friends increase at a college, too. So money is very important. And I take part in club activities. Club activities and group activities need much money because a camp for training and game and so on.  But , on the other hand , there is a person to say to study in a college. So they say that a part-time job is obstacle to study. But I think that a part-time job is to study society. It is important for a person who goes out to society to study society. A part-time job may different to work at society. But I think that to work can learn a sense of responsibility. What I say first is that it is valuable for college students to have independence at a college. At a college , a college student is not only studying knowledge , but also need to experience society. So I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.   
I agree with to do part-time job. Certainly, studying is the most important thing for students. But I think that it is important to do part-time job. There are many reasons to think that. First, we university students need money to spend full campus life. For example, we enjoy circle or club activity, study abroad, and buy textbooks with spending much money. Second, part-time job teach us a lot of rule of society. To earn money is difficult. So, it makes our spirit strong. Because of this, we must be responsible for our job when we do it. If we have a trouble in our job, we must not escape from there and we should make efforts to solve it. And part-time job teach us correct way of talking. So I think that part-time job is the best practice for a full-time job. Third, we university students must independent from our parents gradually. When we were high school students, we are totally dependent on our parents for food, clothing, and shelter. But some university students live alone. Then, they canÅft eat foods cooked by their mothers. Earning money to do part-time job is one of way to independent from their parents.   So I think that it is important to do part-time job for university students. 
I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job , because having a part-time job helps living of my family. Actually I teach high-school student English once a week. Using money I earn, I spend the money on books, commuter ticket, cloth and so on. College students have a lot of chance to play with friends, so use a lot of money. They get some money from their parent, but the money is not usually enough. Most college students cannot make ends meet without a part-time job.  Other reason I agree with the opinion is that having a part-time job is related with job when college students graduate from their college. I think that having a part-time job becomes study of society. In my case, by teaching student English I learn how difficult it is to teach study and by communicating with student, I build relationship of human. When I work at office, I have already learned the necessary way for society a little. I think that if a person does not have a part-time job, he or she is in trouble about work. That is why I want to have a lot of part-time job during life of college. 
 I donÅft agree with the statement; it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  I think, itÅfs important for students who are interested in having one, but not for all college students. Indeed, having a job in oneÅfs early time can be a good experience for his/her full-time work after graduation or his/her dairy life by learning social rules and communicating with other people. But, for ones who donÅft direct to part-time jobs, including me, working can be worthless or even painful because part-time jobs are instable in situations, working places and colleagues, on part-time job students can earn less money in contrast to his/her contribution, and at the largest point, students are fully busy in college lives.  Many college students must do homework and come to university for a long way. They are also expected to do extra studies before and after lectures. So they have a little time to spend freely. A part-time job spends his/her precious time. In fact, I have only 9 lectures a week now, including 4 lectures with homework, but I have time for my hobby only on Saturday and Sunday. Even then, of course, I have to study so that the length of the free time depends on the contents of the lectures and homework.  Certainly there are students who have some time and students who are attracted in working on part-time jobs. People like them will have a good time with their colleagues and customers, a pleasant of earning money, and so on. I donÅft deny the people getting them with their own wills. But I think itÅfs not good to force all college students to get part-time jobs, telling that they must be good for them. Weather having a job or not should be decided by studentsÅf own. 
I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have three reasons for my opinion. I think that we have good experience by a part-time job. This is a reason that I begin to start a part-time job, because I think that this is very good social study. My part-time job is restaurant .I thinks that experience of the service industry is useful for an occupation of future. I think that a burden of parents decreases. Actually, I use my salary of part-time job for the cost of living and I donÅft get some money by my parents. I think it is easy to use my salary and use various things. We can travel abroad and study various things, buy likely things by my salary. The last reason is very personal reason. I belong to baseball club. Baseball club costs money. For example, we go to the camp in every spring and summer. A baseball articleÅ@is very high. Uniform, spikes, a glove are more two hundred yen. Many my friends belong to various circle. Some circle costs money, too. I think that we should have a part-time job, because if we want to do various things at college students, we need much money. 
I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are two reasons why I think that.  First, I think it is important that the college students earn money and live their own life. Many of the college students are helped by their parents. It is hard for them to help their children because they have been helping their children since they were bone. So I think the college students must lighten their parentsÅf load. It is one of the ways for independence.  Second, part-time jobs are useful for studying social life. Many of the college students will work after their graduation. They should practice the way they work through a part-time job, I think. It is important to know what is working and how hard they earn money. IÅfm sure that those experiences must be treasure in their life.  Now, IÅfm working for a bar. It is so hard, but I always think that it is necessary for my life. When I take pay for the part-time job, I feel so happy. So I will last the part-time job.  For these reasons, I think that it is important for college students to have a part- time job. 
I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  We can learn many things from having a part-time job. In my case, it is very good experience that I can meet many people and talk to have a part-time job. They tell me many things not only the job with talking with them. For example I learn what I should do while I am in the university to get a job I hope from talking with a person who works at the same work place. And I can change my bad character a little. I used to be not good at talk to other people. But I steadily can do it since I started to work at the workplace. I also learn to earn money is very hard. And I become not to use much money. But, if you have something to want to do, or have to do, you donÅft have to have a part-time job. If you donÅft have any clear vision for future and canÅft find what you should do, have a part-time job and talk with many people. Maybe there is any hint. I could find hint how I spent time while I am in the university. 
I agree this statement.  Someone may say ÅgDoing a part-time job is worthless. Even if you do it, you can get only money. You should use your time for study or hobby.Åh But, I think we, university students, should have experiences about working. Certainly, studying and doing hobbies are worthy. However, working is more meaningful, I think.  While you work, you will make a lot of mistake. You will be scolded by your superior. You will try hard to understand how teach for this boy, how cook this meal, and to recover your superiorÅfs trust. If you only study, you canÅft have these various experiences. That is very pity.  These experiences exist only in business life. In universities, you pass your student life, take a class, write a report and play tennis with your circle mates. I think there is big difference between business life and student life.  In business life, money is very important. People in business always worry about how escape losing money or how get money effectively. There is a kind of interest relationship. But, in student life, you are almost freedom. There is no difficult relationship. Of course you can choose Ågstudent lifeÅh ways, and ignore Ågbusiness life.Åh But, after graduating your university, you must live a business life. So, you should experience business lifeÅfs rules beforehand.   These are reasons why I insist that university students should have a part-time job. 
I agree with the statement. Now, I work part-time, I think that a part-time job is important for college student. Because I think we can be brought up by part-time jobs. I will prove the reasons. There are some reasons.  First, earning money for living by me is important. We may be noticed how important money is and we may appreciate my parents who work hard for family every day. So, I have saved of my money since I started a part-time job. Second, though this may be big, I am studying society by a part-time job. For example, I am working at bar, the jobs are good. But sometimes those are very hard. When many guest come bar at the same time, workers become very busy. I used to be confused when I started working. But it is a year ago. I got cooking skill and patience. So I can get over small problems.  Third, we can make new human relations. I made friends with many people. I often go to play with them. They become my best friends. In this way, I have got through precious experience. But I worry about that I neglect studying as I belong to baseball club, I am busy for club activity. So I should do my best studying, club activity and a part-time job. 
I agree with college student having a part-time job. There are two reasons of student having a part-time job. First case is that students need earn to support themselves. Most people may donÅft disagree with this case. Second case is that not poor students have a part-time job to use for their leisure or hobby. Some people disagree with this case, because they think having a part-time job makes students tend to study less and less.   But I think having a part-time job is need for students in second case, because through a part-time job they can learn how to live in a society. Of cause, study is most important for student. So itÅfs not acceptable that a part-time job makes students spend less time for studying. But reading books donÅft teach us how to make relationships with others in our lives. Some people may say students can learn social life through life with friends and parents. But sometimes we need not only to corporate voluntarily but also to compromise with others in our lives. If students have a part-time job, they have to follow their boss or rules in work place. Students learn various kinds of relation with others through a part-time job. So a part-time job helps student learn how to contribute to society.  When I was high school student, I have a part-time job of pizza delivery. I was not good at pizza delivery. Whenever my boss often scolded me for my job, I felt bad. Since I donÅft want to be scolded, I was hard to listen to bossÅfs operation not to make a mistake. Through a part-time job I learn importance of following wise or skillful people.    
I agree with the statement. IÅfm going to show that why I think so.  First, college students are already almost adult. So they should not depend on their father or mother. But I donÅft say that college students must be independent perfectly. I want to say that they should reduce their parentsÅf responsibility. This is very important. Second, doing part time job has good effect for the student. It makes a lot of opportunity to talk or communicate a lot of people, as coworker or as visitor. They have really a lot of character. When student working, he must be professional. It is very hard and severe, but such experience will give him a lot of chance to grow himself.  Doing part time job is wonderful thing. It gives us money and something priceless called ÅeexperienceÅf.  Students should use the money to reduce their parentsÅf responsibility. I said so. But, if student have a time and enough money, it is very good experience to go abroad. It is difficult to go abroad and communicate with foreign languages, after graduation. So, doing part time job gives us a lot of choice. So, college students should have part time job. But, what they really should do is studying. They never forget studying always. 
 I think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job.  Comparing college students with high school students, we can know that college students have much more free time. I think that they had better make this free time valuable. For example, it is important to devote club activities. Through a club activity, they can learn the relationship between senior and junior. ThatÅfs very important for them. This experience must be useful when they are a member of the society. Another way of learning the social relationship, it is useful to have a part-time job. I donÅft belong to any clubs now, but I have two part-time jobs. One is Sushiya, the other is Yakinikuya. At Sushiya, I learned how to cut fish. At Yakinikuya, I learned how to smile for service. Both skills are essential to have a life for oneself, of course to have a life as a member of the society. In addition, students who have a part-time job learn how to manage own money. I think this skill is the most important to be a member of the society. We canÅft get the skill, if we have a campus life simply and belong to a club simply. Therefore, I think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job.
I think it is important for college students to have a part time job. Now I will show you some reasons. Firstly I help my parents to pay my school fees. I give my parents some money every month. So they are very happy. I think I should help them even slightly because I was brought up by them. Secondly it is important to earn money I spend for myself. And it is necessary to do anything about myself. I like to drink and smoke so it takes much money. I like music so I buy many CDs. So I need much money.   Finally it is important to try to go out into the world while college students. I can learn many things. For example, human relations, social system and so on. I work at bar five day a week. So I learn service and cooking. These are very useful. On the other hand, some people may say I can not study for long time because I have a part time job. But I think it is important to do both of them for college students. In this way I think it is important for college students to have a part time job.   
Is it important for college student to do part time job? ThatÅfs a difficult question. I thought of it for 30 minutes, but I canÅft make the answer of it. What should I do?  OK, letÅfs consider it, assuming that I begin to do part time job. There are some merits and demerit. Now I try listing them.  Merit       1, I can earn some money.              2, IÅfll have valuable experience there.              3, I can make new friends there.   Demerit    1, IÅfll be tired and cost much time.   Wow, demerit is only one! Is this a great victory of ÅgagreementÅhÅc?   No, itÅfs too early to determine conclusion. Majorities are not always correct. LetÅfs consider them.  About merit 1 and merit 3, I donÅft need more money or friends now. In fact, they are important, but we donÅft need them infinitely.   About demerit 1, this is a fatal demerit. It became a barrier for me to study hard! I became a university student to study, so I donÅft want to do part time job very much. Wow, is this a victory of ÅgobjectionÅh!?   ÅcOh. I remember very very important thing. The first question is not ÅgIs it important for me?Åh I donÅft want to do part time job, but that cannot be the answer of the question. I must think from many studentsÅf point of view.  WellÅc.would they rather want to study than do part time job? This is an easy question. The answer will be ÅgNoÅh. And some who is poor need money.   Now I get the answer of the first question. It is ÅgDoing part time job is important for college students.Åh  You may say ÅgWhich they want to do canÅft become the answer,Åh but I thin college students are not children, so their wills are very important.  
I agree with this topix. College student have to get a job soon after they graduate college. If they don't know about job at all, they were confused with what they should do. I think, however, if they have some experience, they natulaly start to do a job. Moreover, part time job tells us the system of our economic society. Adult say "don't group part time job and regular job". It is true, but without part time job, we can't know actual economy at all. I heard that in foreign college, student pay school expenses themselves. Therefore almost of them have a  parttime job. So they treasure their lecture. In contrast, in japan, including me, parent pay school expenses. So we tend to think lecture is free and don't treasure it. Paying expenses is very dificult for me, so we shold gratitude for our parents. Insted of that, I think we should know the importance of money. trough part time job, We can know little about that. now I don't have part time job, but at no distant date, I want to do a part time job. I plan to do a home teacher.  With this job, I want to experience little economic society and know the importance of money. 
In my opinion, It is not important for college student to do a part time job. However, you should do a part time job.  To do a part time job waste your time and energy. After work, you can get some money. This money mostly use for play, for example, go shopping, watch movie, and going karaoke. They are all time waster. So part time job prevent you to study. Part time job has some faults, but it has also some advantage. First, you can develop your ability in your part time work. For example, if you want to be a teacher, you can learn how to teach in clam school in your part time job. In this case part time job helps to study. Second, when you were high school student, you have a strong relationship with their family, but now some of you live alone, some of you have weaker relationship with family then before. And in my opinion, a relationship with college friend is weaker than it was in highschool. But you do a part time job, You can make another friends. If you fail to make friend and troubled to your work ,you can leave it and start another job.     
I think itÅfs important for college students to do a part time job. I have two reasons to think so.        The first one is that a part time job helps students to understand about jobs in the society. Many Japanese students are not expected to work. They have only to study in their college. But when students who have not done a part time job graduate from the college and start to work, they get confused because they have never had responsibility for the society. To avoid this situation, students have to work in the society and get a sense of responsibility.       The second one is that there are students who have to do a part time job because of their economic situation. College students need more money than you expect. They must pay school fee, traffic density and the cost of living if they live alone. If they were banned from doing a part time job some students would give up studying in a college. It is true that students who do a part time job canÅft have all the classes but they study hard to make up for the blank. So it is important to help them.       Because of the two reasons I agree to students doing a part time job. 
I donÅft agree with part time jobs of college students partially. It is because part time jobs have not only good aspects but also bad aspects.  First of all, its good aspect, part time jobs gives college student many experiences. For example, if you work as a crew of convenience stores, you meet many people. But you had to do many things; using the register for payments and putting commodities on the show cases orderly, accepting goods for door-to-door delivery service, etc. All crews wear the blue striped shirts as uniform in store. Whenever customers come and go, we all say ÅgIrasshaimase (Welcome)Åh orÅgArigato-gozaimashita (Thank you)Åh loudly in unnatural accent. Convenience stores part time jobs is very easy for us, but deferent part time job may be very difficult or busy Åc But they are student. College studentÅfs real job is to study and to learn. Some of college studentÅfs goal is entering employment. Such students can use internship program. This is different from part time jobs, it is not only job but also study. But this is for such students. I agree with this pattern job. But just an ordinary part time jobs is not good for student much. 
I am opposite to the part-time job of the college students. Because I think that student's obligation is in study. If college students work part-time job, it is likely to become whether the nature is taken from the university student in the part-time job, and studies are sparse. Moreover, when becoming a college student, the college students in Japan tend not to study especially because he or she has studied for a difficult university examination. Therefore, it is necessary to work hard at study. However, it is likely to become whether study is sparse when working part-time. It is difficult we for men to unite quite two. It is very small number of people even if there is a person who can do. Therefore, it is more efficient than it concentrates on one at secondarily it simultaneous. Additionally, I want you to make a lot of time that concentrates on study to learn it to the university student because there are a lot of things that can be learnt only when is in the university. Because it is the last chance that the university can study, and the studied time be taken, I want you to use the university enough. These are the reasons that I oppose the part-time job of the university student though the above-mentioned is only one side. 
I am for this idea. College students ordinary have a lot of time. Of course, spending the time in studying is important for students, but, I think it is also valuable we have experience that we work to earn money. Because after we study something at university for 4 or 6or more years, we must work at company. Until then, we do only studying, when we start working, we might be at a loss. In order not to do so, I think doing a pert time job is valid. And, if we do a part time job, we can do something favorite to spend money. For example, traveling, studying abroad, buying somethingÅcetc. In order to do spending money and experiencing, we can get skill and knowledge and improve ourselves. What is more, we can meet many people at the working place. If we donÅft do a part time job, we canÅft meet them. By meeting various people and talking about many things, we get various senses of values. And I think we can live a full life for that. Lastly, by doing part time job, I suppose we can do better consumer on our time.  That is why I think doing part time job is important for college students.  
Nowadays, too many young people tend to believe that money is made by itself. The spread of illusions that people can spend money and obtain pleasures without works, labors, efforts, the phantoms that stuffs come into existence spontaneously, of course, there is somebody who works for them, but it isnÅft noticed and considered.  Due to continuing easy life despite the lack of working, they are oblivious of an obvious principal that they have to work for it. The problem is every young man has been raised without understanding the importance of it. Many people say the duty of students is to study, or to enjoy life at their free will. But there are dangers of this idea. Consequently, they learn that they can enjoy life without working and are good at making others to work. ItÅfs very dangerous because they can grow up to be such people who donÅft like working in spite of being paid enough money. And those ideas will lead to dreams of making a big fortune at one stroke. If they donÅft learn to work, they will be more insincere, lazier and want more convenience. Therefore, there is no liability to let students work, but, we donÅft have to stop them from doing a part-time job. 
I agree that college students do a part time job. It is because they can learn many things and spend time usefully. In fact, I do a part time job. I understand that it is very hard to earn.  So I came to save money. In addition, I could learn the importance of human relations and consideration for others. By doing a part time job, I could grow up. Before they get out into the world, they should do a part time job. And they should know how hard it is to earn. But they shouldnÅft neglect their duty. Their duty is studying. I think it is most important to study for college students. If they neglect their duty because of a part time job, they should quit a part time job. But if they have too much time on their hands and play without studying, they should do a part time job.  Through a part time job, I could learn that I must have the responsibility for my job as a member of society. It is the important thing for us living in society. I want to be a person who takes the responsibility for my job in the future. And I want them to be such a person. That is why I recommend college students to do a part time job.  
I think that college students should work a partÅ|time job.    I have three reasons why they should work.  First, they have much time to do anything. If they donÅft after classes at university, they must be bored and gray. Second, if they donÅft have so much money, they will not be able to make their friends easily. I think that in their life to have much money is the key to live their life happily. Finally, I think that to work a part-time job is to practice to go out in society.  They can get moral and manners at workplace because they can contact with elder people.   I work three kinds of part-time jobs now. It was not until I begin to work that to make money is very heavy. Due to this feeling, these days I hesitate to buy trivial things ,for example, juice by the vending machine, snack at convenience store and game soft etcÅc  Moreover, when I have much money,  I become to think that I want to buy brand clothes and more expensive things than before.  I think very much that to work a part-time job is necessary for them to live schoolÅfs life happily.  
I agree to the opinion that it is important for college students to do a part time job. There are two reasons. The first reason is through a part time job, we can learn a lot of things that we cannot learn in school. For example, we can learn etiquette and correct honorific words through service industry, and we can learn how to instruct through a tutor job. They are important skill after we go out into the world, too. Part time jobs are rehearsals of the future for college students.  The second reason is money. College student is almost adult. So I think we must earn our cost of living by ourselves as much as we can. It is not good to be our parentsÅf burden. Through part time jobs, we can appreciate that how hard to make money is and the importance of money.  Actuary, it is the part of students to study. It is foolish to pay very expensive school fees and sleep throughout the lecture. But I believe that it is more important to challenge various things. It will never be vain for college students to do a part time job. Hard study, hard work and delightful group activity will make the college life satisfactory. 
 I agree with the opinion with two reasons.  First, college students get a member of society after several years. If they donÅft know rules or manners in society or working place, they must mistake in lots of cases. They canÅft excuse about mere basic mistakes because they are a member of society, not a part time job or something. If they have learned rules or manners in society because of part time job, they must mistake in only few cases. They may mistake, but they may less mistake because they know more knowledge in society than the other group.  Second, college students are classified as adults, not as children. Children should depend their lives on parents, but adults should not depend their lives on others. Of course, it is difficult to classify them, so some says they are not adults. But they are not Children, too. They should not depend their lives on others perfectly. So they should earn a part of the cost of living as the step to a member of society.  Some says college is a studying place, not working place. But I think college students should learn not only mathematics or English, but also rules or manner in society. 
I agree with this opinion.  Because we can learn what we canÅft learn at school. For example we learn the contents of the part time job. It is very natural.  But we donÅft know it until we do the job. We can know it only after I work. Then I think we can learn how to contact various people. At university, it is often that we only contact the people of the same generation of same university.  For instance people of the same faculty or same club and so on. So we donÅft talk to the people of the other generation or other university students.  But if we do the part time job, opportunities to talk to the people of the other generations or other university students would increase. For that reason we can learn how to contact various people naturally. And we come to understand importance of the money and difficulty of work.  I thought to earn the money is not so difficult until I do the part time job. However it was very difficult.  I am very tired from little work. Accordingly I thank my parents more than before beginning a part time job. So I think it is important for college students not studying at school but also doing a pat time job. 
I agree to the opinion that itÅfs important for college students to do a part time job.    I have some reasons.  First, if college students donÅft have any money, they canÅft do anything: for example, buying books, playing with their friends, and having a date with a girlfriend. Especially, men not having money canÅft have a date, so I think men should do a part time job.  Second, if college students want to work at a business in the future, it is good thing for them to enjoy good experience at a part time job. I think they had better know a rule of society. They will be able to prepare to join a society there.  Third, college students will come to find money precious as they get money on their own. These days they donÅft notice how precious money is. They are inclined to think that they have a lot of money. So from this point of view, working is an important thing.  People may think that college students should study learning. But I think it is more important for them to learn things like a rule of society without schoolwork. Even if they do well at school, people not knowing common things of society will be not able to enter society. 
I think that to do a part time job is good. Because I can do various experience through work, know serious of earnings of money and work with different generation. Now, I do a part time job in the cram school and teach mathematics. I have to do the explanation that understands easily. But that is difficult. It needs explanation skill. This skill will be useful in the future like presentation for anything. I gave one example, but other job needs various abilities.   Moreover, I think that it can think about money that can be obtained by working. Money that had been spent before it works part-time is all money that parents earned. Therefore, the importance of money is not very understood. I will not have a big regret if the importance of money is understood if money is spent too much. And, if it knew it, it will try to think about the usage of money. I think that the amount of people spends much money than they has spent though they doesn't spend a lot between university students. Therefore, it is important to know the importance of money.  There might be other things what obtained by working part-time. Therefore, I think that it is good the part-time job of the university student. 
I agree the idea that it is important for college students to do a part time job. Why I think so? First, I think the part time job teaches them what working is like. In these days, young people who do not feel like working Å\ generally, they are called ÅhNEETÅh Å\ are increasing in Japan. It is a serious problem. If they know what working is like and wonderfulness of earning money of working, ÅgNEETÅh will decrease in the future. Second, doing a part time job, students can gain various experience. For example, we seldom do a clerkÅfs part. But service industry enables them to do the part, and they understand how to communicate to customers as clerks. But, if students take too much time to do a part time job, they may ignore studying, though they are college students. So I think they must pay attention to take studying time as well as a part time job time. Although I state several opinions about students doing a part time job, I have never done the job. But at some point in time, I would like to do the job because I think I would be better off experience many things.  
   I agree with this opinion for the following reasons.    First, I think doing a part-time job means preparation for working in society. When you do a part-time job, you can learn relationship between you and other people who work at the same corporation. For example, you have to respect your boss, if you hate him or her. You have to drink with old persons in the same corporation, if you hate them. You can also learn about responsibility for your action and yourself. In a corporation, you have a role to work. If you donÅft work well, this corporation wonÅft work well too. You have to work well and have good results.    Second, you can buy something you want. If you join a jazz club, you need instruments. For example, it is guitar, bass, violin, and so on. If you join a tennis team, you need rackets, tennis balls and uniforms. If you join an adventure club, you need a knapsack, and shoes which are very strong enough to survive hiking. If you do a part-time job and earn money, you can buy them without your parentsÅf help. It is important for college students because it can lead independence against their parents. 
    I agree with this opinion. It is important for college students to have a part-time job, I think too. They need much money to play with their friends, to buy cloths, books, CDs, DVDs and something they want, and so on. So they should do a part-time job so as to earn this money. This is one reason, of coarse.     But there is more important reason. It is that they learn system in society, hardness to earn money and important of money through the part-time job. The system is that if they need money, they must work as a member of society to earn money. When they were children they didnÅft know important of money because their parents maybe gave them money. But when they are adults they must earn money by themselves. As a pre season to be adults, they should do a part-time job when they are college students. By working as a member of society, they learn important of money and know it is hard to earn money, which are not taught in a school or college. If they learn that money is important, they donÅft use much money and they donÅft buy things that are unnecessary. Then they get ability to select what they need in a lot of things.     Because of above reasons, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. 
I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  Because it is useful for young people to work. I think there are two good  points.  First, if young people have a part-time job, young people will be able to  communicate with other people better than now. Recently, young people are  said that they canÅft communicate with other people very well. This  situation is bad. Because I think that it is essential for us to communicate  with other people. So I think young people should practice to communicate  with other people.  Second, if young people have a part-time job, young people understand that  it is very hard to earn money. When young people know it, young people must  stop wasting money. If young people give much money from their parents  without having a part-time job, young people must waste money without  thinking. In addition, young people will thank their parents. Their parents  will feel happy. And young people will be independent from their parents. It  is good for young people. Because young people will have to live by  themselves in the future. If young people canÅft live by themselves, young  people will be at a loss. It is a very bad.  I think young people should have a part-time job. Many experiences in a  part-time job will help young people when young people start to live by  themselves. A part-time job will teach us many things. So I think that it is  important for college students to have a part-time job.   (257 words) 
I think college students need to work in part time job for getting money and responsibility.  When I was a high school student, working in part time job was banned by my high schools law, so, I didnÅft know how working was.  When I become a college student, I start to work in part time job to get some money, for example, assistant in construction field, visiting teacher, street advertising staff, human sample for chemical substance, and so on Åc.  For the first time, I think that getting money is most important than other things, but, through working in various jobs and being concerned in many people living in several social positions, I learned that duties follow labor.  When I was lasted for meeting time for 5~10 minutes or misunderstood meeting place, I was scolded severely by chief, I was angry ,but, it is natural that the manÅfs behavior, in group works, one person was late for schedule, others of the groupÅfs members must wait the rude man.  College students tend to be uplift personal humans, so, they (we) need to work to see many worlds and systems, to know how the working for  one of the gears of society. 
I agree with this statement. I have two main reasons.  First, college students often go to the places where we have to spend money to play such as amusement parks, JYANNBOKARAOKE, RAUND1, bars and so on. If they donÅft have a part-time job and being paid such expenses by their parents, I think it is so miserable as a about twenty-years-old man. Thus I think we should regard a college student as an almost adult not as a child. So they cannot help being paid such as school fee, rent for the apartment. But they at least have to pay their playing expenses on their own. If they do that, they would be able to realize how it is hard to make money and stop wasting of money.  Secondly, if we have a part-time job, we can not only earn money but also acquire some skills which we canÅft learn in the college. For example, when we work as a Ågtelephone appointerÅh ?calling those who have children and teaching parents how it is important to study. then persuading parents to buy some teaching materials for their childrenÅfs studyÅ|. And when we work at construction sites, we can acquire some skills such as how to paint, the way we can easily carry heavy things and so on. So I think we especially had better have a part-time job which we can acquire some useful skills.  Therefore I believe part-time jobs are important for college students. But of course, we must not forget our schoolwork in our college.        
 I think it is important that college students have a part-time job. There are two reasons for this.   One is that you can learn how to spend money. Although most of the college students have received pocket money from parents until they enter a college, it comes to be possible to earn it for oneself by having a part-time job. Through working part-time, you can realize that money is got not easily but by working hard. As a result, you come to save money and spend it carefully and premeditatedly.   The other is that you can make friends with more people. In being the school which you belong to, you have little opportunity to get friends with the people who do not belong to the same school as you. However, by getting acquainted with the people who belong to other schools and promoting mutual friendship with them at the place where you have a part-time job, you can make your campus life more full.   For two reasons mentioned above, I think college students should work park-time. And, I think part-time job is an indispensable part of the campus life and the college students who have not had it yet should start to have it at once.   
I agree the opinion that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  Campus lifeÅfs main is not only academic study but also getting ready for life as a member of society.  When they graduate from college, they have to live as a member of society.  Through part-time job, they can learn importance of working, a sense of fulfillment of working, social customs, etiquette, common sense, and so on. Then, human relations spread. Besides, chance that they are exposed to society is increase.  These are very important for college students to live as a member of society.     Relatively, college students have a lot of time to spend freely. I think that they should experience various things with that free time. For that reason, they need money. Therefore, it is necessary that college students help for income of part-time job to spend campus life usefully.     Of course, it is not good for college students to have a part-time job for all neglecting their studies. However, part-time job is chance to learn about society and learn about our hidden talents and develop mentally.      For that reason, I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.     
 I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  You may say that college students shouldnÅft have a part-time job but  study. But I think that colleges are not the place which students only  study   I have a part-time job. I am a home teacher. The job is difficult to do. I  think that to teach is much more difficult than to learn. But it is a lot  of fun. I am very happy when I let my students solve problems which they  havenÅft been able to solve. Then, I feel that I got to be able to watch  things by more views. This means that I got wiser at that moment. This is  fantastic thing because to be wise is one of the real purposes of college  students. Indeed, the part-time job which I have ever had is only home  teacher, but other jobs also have the real purposes of college students. So  I think it is important for us to have a part-time job.  Our part-time jobs also help our parents by money. To study at college  need much money. So our parents can face hardships because of money. But if  we have a part-time job, they can avoid the hardships. Thinking from above  reasons, to have a part-time job is good for us. 
I agree with the statement. And I think it is important for college students t o have a part-time-job. I have two reasons. Firstly, I think that part-time-job is one of learning society. Part-time-job  provides college students with many important things. For example, They can kn ow severeness of society, manners in working, and pleasure of salary. I think  these experience surely raise a person. Most people have to work after graduating university or graduate school. If he  or she has never worked before then, I think it is very dangerous. I think it  is too hard for a person who has never had part-time-job to work suddenly in  this severe society. It is necessary to experience walking during college stud ent.  Secondly, college students need a lot of money. Elementary school, junior high  school, and high school students usually can get their money from their paren ts every month. However, college students are not children yet. So I think the y have to earn their money by oneself. Thanks to a part-time-job, college stud ents can help their parents. Part-time-job brings us great experience and money. I experienced and learned  many things through a part-time-job too. I think these are very worthful. I th ink college students should have a part-time-job.  
 I think that part-time job is valuable to college students.   The position of college students in society is on pre-adult stage. So student can have many chances to know society. Doing part-time job related to work in the future. If students have pert-time job, he or she may discover his or her potential capacities and develop their ability. Moreover they might know what they want to do in the future. Knowing society means touching movement of society. For example, when I had part-time job at the factory of Kappazusi and saw various frozen foods, I think that foods which we eat everyday come through human working. I was surprised. Where did these foods come from? How did this drink reach to me? Around our life, there are many products. Even if the goods isn`t handmade and made from machine, somebody would be concerned in the process of production. Then, I consider what I can do and what I should do for having the job.   And a part-time job gives students practical good things. That is wage. It is important to use the money earned themselves, while they compare two worth: their effort and the good which they want to buy. I think that money from income of parents differ from the money of themselves too. After little years, they will get only themselves profit. So, they can practice the management of money. They can understand difficulty of getting money and living by themselves.  Lastly, in school life, student experience many important things. There are communication and cooperation. Though, part-time job may expand their world. It is job outside their school that gives special feeling; responsibility, happiness, and achievement, and another position to student. The environment around people affects their sense of values and way of thinking. I agree.     
I agree with this opnion. There are three reasons.  Firstly, college students can answer for behavior through they have a part-time job. I have worked on the chainese restaurant, I had to keep my uniform and body -especially hands- clearn to serve guest food. And I had to keep smile to take a good service. If I take a mistake, I will trouble with other staffs. So, they become to answer for their behaviors.  Secondly, college students can learn from society through they have a part-time job. I have a job which is for short term. Before, I have worked on the office of advertisement. At the office, I tidied up accounts, copied advertisement, and inputed names and adresses. Then, I surely join a little in society.  Finaly, college students can earn through they have a part-time job. Almost all of college students doesn't have a lot of money. But, they think "We play moreÅI" So, a part time job realize thier dreams.  So, I think it is very important that college students have a part-time job. Surely, that will be very important experience. 
I think that it is important for college students to have a part-times job. I have two reasons on my opinion.  Firstly, we can use money right and left for it is the money we earn by ourselves. Many college students live by their selves. We spend much of money which our parents send us on the lodging charge and the money for food. If we have no money, we can not play with our friends. So if we enjoy campus life, we must earn by ourselves by having a part-times job. We do not always have money we earn by ourselves for playing with friends, by the way. There is another use. We send our parents present on their birthday. They will be pleased at getting such a good present and our sentiment on them.  Secondly, we can study the society by having a part-times job. Though college students are student, their position is close to person of the society. I think that it is a great experience for those who college students who get out into the world to work in the society. We have opportunity to contact with elderly people when work part-time. Hearing these peopleÅfs talk helps our future life. This may give us valuable things than earning money.  Therefore I think that it is important for college students to have a part-times job.  
  I agree with the opinion. Some students live by themselves, and others live with their family. The former get money from their parents, but it is limited. Sometimes they may have a trouble about housekeeping money. So they need or want to get more money, and as a result, they have part-time job. On the other hand, even if the latter have no money, they can get it from their parents immediately. For that reason, some people disagree with the opinion. But I think doing part-time job not only can get money, but also has another good aspect.   College students are ÅgstudentÅh and also like Åga member of societyÅh. They study to take a job in the college and prepare to be a member of society in a daily life. For that purpose, the part-time job is a good place. We can learn many things from colleague or boss, for example, etiquette, behavior, common sense, communication with other people and what is working, and so on. They are very important for us to live in a society. We canÅft learn them in the college or the home. Above all, we can taste the pleasure of working, get money by ourselves and using it for us. But donÅft forget that the main purpose of college students is study. If we do part-time job extremely and our grades fall, it is nonsense.
I think that university students should work part time job. It is true that if they do it, they must reduce their time to study. But, in a long term, we can regard the four years of campus life as a ready for being a member of society. University and college are places where students study very hard and become specialists about their specialty. And they work remarkably as specialists in company and laboratory. But, if they had great talents, it would be no use if they behave worse. Society demands them for manner as a factor of community. But they canÅft acquire its manner only in university. So, part time job is available for us to acquire its manner. We must learn manner, for example, how to contact with boss, colleagues, and guests, existing a seniority system. Moreover, they must notice ''lie''. In society, many people are not so kind. There are a lot of dirty faces in society. We have to associate with their unfavorable sides. To get along with bad surfaces of society is demanded them.  First, we belong to family. Second, we belong to school. Third, we belong to society. Thus, we belong to bigger and bigger community. Large community demands members for more things. So students should work part time job to acquire manners.   
I agree with this opinion. There are two reasons.  The first is that I can learn the community when I communicate with people who have the same part-time job. When I graduate from college and become a member of society. I should need the courtesy and manner in the community necessarily. I think it is easier to learn them before becoming a member of society than after becoming one. For example, I teach students by one-to-one in the juku as a part-time job. When I communicate with students and other teachers. I learn the clear respecting language and receive phone calls exactly
  I think the college students should have a part-time job because they can learn to work as one portion in society. For example, they will learn how difficult is it to earn money and will not spend money idly. I donÅft have a part-time job now. But I had worked at super market for one month. In spite of short time, I learned how to handle cash register, earn money, say greeting, behave to customers and etc.    There may be an opinion that if the college students have time to work part-time, they should fill up more student life. But today we can have a part-time job if there is time just a little. So they can enjoy student life and have a part-time job.    I think that it is better changing various part-time jobs than remaining one part-time job all the time because we can learn various thingsÅDFor  instance, we will find our good point and bad point and the work that fitted oneself.     For these reason, the part-time job has many good points for the college students to grow up the adults. So I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.      
I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. First reason is that they need more and more money for various things. For example, clothes, CDs, DVDs and of course textbooks.  But they cannot get money easily.  So they will know the importance of money, and acquire the sense of money. Second, they will make many friends if they have a part-time job.  They will be able to learn the way ob communication with other people. Third reason (I think this is the most important reason.), college students should have experience the labor before they start to work in society in the future.  Through a part-time job, they can learn the behavior and words toward their boss or seniors. If they work as home teacher and so on, they will be able to become more intelligence with their students.  If they work in a first-food restaurant and so on, they will learn the behavior that make other people feel good. To be sure, some people say that they cannot have their own free time. And other people say that they have to be to blame for their work.  But it is necessary to try to overcome those difficulties. Thus, it is very useful to have a part-time job.  So I agree to this subject. 
I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. They should try to understand our society more and more. So they can know a part of this society to have a part-time job. Now I have a part-time job. I work at kaiten sushi in Osaka. I work there for half of year, but I could know many things. The things I knew are three subject.   First, I could know importance of the money to stand on my own feet. Before than now, I have received money from my parents. In those days, I thought it is a little. So I always thought that I want to get much money. Now I work to get much money. So I can do many things. But I understand to get a lot of money is very very difficult!!  Second, I can communicate many kind of people. In my college, I am not able to communicate varies people, because the college students are similar. But in my workplace, there are many kind of peple. For example,the one man is high school student. And the one woman is musician. And the other man is the elderly.  Finally, part-time job is not real bussiness. So schoolwork and a part-time job are compatible with each other. College students must study the first. So a part-time job is the best work.  
I agree this topic. I have three reasons for this opinion. First I think that part-time jobs are studying of society. College students will become members of society. We have to accustom to working. It is important to experience for work. If we college students have got a part-time job once, I think when we get a job, it is easy to work.      Second we learn the community of society. If we donÅft get a part-time job, we have only the community of school. I think that we college students have to have several of communities, and we improve our sense of value. Then we will do well when we are employed.      Finally we college students have to start to independence from our parents. Because by get a part-time job we earn some money. In the money point we remove our parents from responsibility. We need some money for playing eating and so on. We have to thank for parents, so it is good to earn some money by our own. We also can independence from parents in the side of mind. I think we are able to grow up by working.       Therefore I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.                                            
I think college students should have a part-time job. Of course, IÅfm sure that college studentsÅf work is studying, but there is some reason. The first reason is that they have known about the society yet. They must work as a member of society one day. Before they get a job, they should learn social skills, and be taught how hard living in society is. Students which were always studying in their high school days should do so, including me. I also donÅft have social skills at all. Especially I have difficulty in talking with other people, so I want to become good at it. I think that the ability to talk with other people is required anywhere in society.   Second, they should learn how difficult earning money is. Till now, they have been always using money, and able to get money from their parents. One day they will have to get money in their own. To prepare for it, college students should have a part-time job as soon as possible. I have been having a part-time job since I had entered the university. Before I entered the university, I thought that money appears naturally whenever I wanted it. But I was making a big mistake. I realized that earning money is very hard and I must not waste too much.   Anyway I really agree to the opinion that college students should have a part time job.   
"I think that it is vary important for college students to have a part-time job.  One of the reason is that college students spare a lot of money to buy some clothes and to play with friends and to do what you want to do.  In particular, in the case of a student who lives alone, he also must pay bill of meal,electricity and so on.  College students have to get much money.  Another reason is that the experience that you did a part-time job will be useful when you get an official job, and you can be used to doing a job and have a confidence about work. So, you will be able to work efficiently. In addition, if you have a part-time job, you have something to do with more and more people and you learn how to touch each other and you will make friends. Moreover with what you learn in a part-time job, you can live a college life. So you can have a good time than ever. Because in terms of part-time job, you can understand the difference between college and society, you can spend college life, considering you should learn something in order to play a good part in future.  " 
"I agree with this idea of ÅeIt is important for college students to have a part-time job. Åfit is because it is necessary for college student to be independent of their parents. These days they are a lot of people who completely depend on their parents. This is against the law of human.They are given money without working and they do not have responsibility for everything.Today,this is one of the charactaristic problems in Japan and this problem hove become more and more serious . I think the solution of this problem is to have a job no matter how easy it is.It is important to have a job. In my case,this year I have started to live alone and I have a part-time job.I did not realize the importance of independent of my parents and of responsibility for something until I have a part-time job.I am working at restaurant .In that place all what I did is responsible for me and the money I earned from that job become a lot of items whichi is necessary for my life.I become careful when I use my money.I believe I am a little independent of my parents.Thus,I think to have a part-time job is important for college students. " 
"I agree with this opinion. There are a lot of reasons why I think so.  I did not have a part-time job until I became a college student. So I was given some money to play with my friends by my parents. However, I work at the restaurant and at the cram school of English. If I work with much trouble and earn money for myself, I realize the importance of money and thank my parents more. I began not to spend too much money.  In the restaurant, I can always learn how to deal with customers. I must keep on being responsible for them there. I am sure that when I graduate from the college and get a job, this experience will help me to survive in society. Also, I can eat dinner or lunch there for nothing after working, so I save a lot of money. I think that this helps the students who live near the college alone especially.     In the cram school of English, not only students but also I can study English. I form examinations, so I can also learn how to use the computer. I am sure that what I experience there is also instructive for me.   As I have described above, from a part-time job, we can learn a lot of things, which we cannot learn in the college. So I think that a college student should have a part-time job.  " 
"I think it important that college students have a part-time job.   Now, I work at hotel. I serve meals at the wedding party and the normal party mainly. I have to do not only serving meals but also many other things. For example, we have to prepare the parties and polish glasses and so on. I have a lot of things to memorize. So, I am tired from the part-time job. But I experienced many important things. They are very fresh for me and I learn them for the first time. Moreover, I canÅft learn them at school. If I continued this job, I could become a person who pays attention to people. IÅfm sure that I can be kind to people. ItÅfs one of the important things I think. In fact, a man who started this job earlier than me can pay attention to people. When I went to a restaurant with him and my seniors, I noticed that he paid attention to everyoneÅfs drinks. I respect him.  Certainly, for college students, the most important thing may be to study hard. Of course, we must not forget to study hard. However, having a part-time job when we are college students is great experience. Therefore, I think that not only studying hard but also having a part-time job is important for college students. " 
"I agree this statement and have three reasons to support my opinion. We college students have even more leisure time than that we have had in last three or six years. What should we use this much time for? First, I think that we should use this time to gain some social experiences. For example, volunteer work or part-time job. So it is good for college students to experience part-time jobs. Second, of course, we want to use this time to play with friends and take out him or her. And we will usually pay some money to play. Moreover, college students have a long summer vacation and in that time all of them must want to travel, go shopping or go to see movies and so on. For more exiting summer vacation, we need to save much money. It is good way to save money to have a part-time job. Third, we college students should have some responsibility for ourselves. To have a job or gain money by himself doesn't always fit with to have some responsibility himself. But if something happen in our home, maybe having a part-time job and gain money by ourselves helps us to keep going school. So I think that it will be not useless for college students to have a part-time job. That's all. " 
"I agree with the statement.  First, I think if we donÅft have a part-time job, we can hardly understand the value of money, and the difficulty of getting money. Some parents would tell their children how hard it is to earn money. But others would not. My mother worked as a doctor in China, my native country, but now she works as a part-timer at a chocolate factory. 15 Years ago my father came to Japan to work as an engineer and 13 years ago my mother and I came to Japan. At that time my mother quitted her job, because in Japan she canÅft use her doctor license. In chocolate factory she sometimes has to carry some heavy boxes and keeps standing. She sometimes told me how hard it is to get money. And I thought I have completely understood the value of money. But after my sixteenÅfs winter vacation, I first had a part-time job, I knew I hadnÅft understand the difficulty of getting money completely. I think only after having the experience of working that we can really understand the value of money. And we are old enough to understand it.  Second, in college we can learn a lot of things, but we canÅft learn how to work. I think it would be hard for us to adapt ourselves to society after our graduation from college without any experience of working in society. So we should have a part-time job during our school days and make some experiences. And I think part-time jobs would also enable us to know the society system around us.  These are the reasons that I agree with the opinion.  " 
" agree with the statement ÅgIt is important for college students to have a part-time jobÅh.  First,recently I often think that college students need a lot of money every day.Especially it is because I am from Wakayama and now live alone in Ojikoen,Kobe City.So I need a lot of money to lead my college life,compared to leading my college life commuting from my local home to a callege.For example,every day meals.Unlike eating at local home,I must manage to eat all meals by myself every day.Although college meals are relatively reasonable,every day,every meals,I often find that my wallet is getting small and thin.Or,the money to company with friends or seniors.I belong to acapella club,and members of the club love karaoke(of course,me too),so we go to karaoke very often. Similarly, I often find that my wallet is getting small and thin.then I become sad.  Second,by working in a real society,we can experience various things.For example,if I work as home teacher or juku teacher,maybe I will learn a difficulty in teaching in the way that the student understand clearly.Or,if I work at restaurant, I will learn a difficulty in cooking.  Because of these reason,I agree with the statement. " 
"I agree with this statement. In my opinion, college students have many free time and many chances to play and drink with their friends or company of club activity. I donÅft think that their parents need to give them money for their playing because college students are old enough to earn money for their playing. Furthermore, school fees are high, and if one lives alone for going to school, it also needs a lot of money. They go to the university with their own will. So they should use their free time to get money for themselves.  Then, the age when one goes to the university is the time when one grows up greatly, so it is important for one to experience many various things. Through the part-time job, students can learn the difficulty of earning money, the worth of money, human relations, and more; they have many things to learn only in youth. Having such experience before employment is probably helpful for themselves, I think.   And they can make friends at the shop where they work part-time. It may be interesting and instructive to have friends of other university or different generation. More friends they have, more interesting their life become, maybe.  This is why I agree with college studentsÅf part-time job.  " 
"I agree with this statement. I have three reasons for this.  One of the reasons is that we can make a lot of friends in part-time job. For example, we can see another college students, housewives or free-lances. They bring us new and peasant experiences. They tell us interesting stories that we never have listened. People who we meet in part-time job will benefit us when we start working in the future.  The second reason is that we can know the importance of money and the difficulty of working. Part-time job of college students are often teaching for high school students or staffs of restaurants. We work only after school. So we cannot earn many money. Until I enter college, I had gotten allowance from my parents. Now I start part-time job and appreciate their kindness.  The third reason is that we can develop our own abilities: we can master politeness if we engage in service occupation or we can become wiser if we give lectures. We can develop abilities which we canÅft study in college. These abilities will help us in another occasion.  For these reasons, I conclude that college student should have various part-time jobs and have a lot of experiences.    " 
" I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time  job.  I have two reasons to think so.  First,we can get money to have a part-time job.In college,the number of students who live alone is larger than in high school or in junior high school.We can get some money from our parents,but it is not enough.We must pay lental house charge,light charge,gus charge and water charge. We also have to pay breakfast,lunch,dinner and so on.In addition to this charge,we need to have clubs or play with friends.So,it is not enough for us to get money from our parents.It is necessary for us to get money.  Second,we need to learn what job is to do a part-time job.College students have more time than high school students.It is very efficient to do a part-time job in that time.We will be social people after graduate college .We learn what society or social people is before we will be them to some degree. For example ,how to communicate with other people,boss,and costomer,how to deal with my mistakes and so on.In there ,we can get some skills which we can not get in school.So,it is important for us to learn what jobs is and what society is to some degree.So I think that to have a part-time job is very important for college students." 
"I agree with this statement,because we need pay much money in some reasons.   We are adults.We should not be dependent on our parents.So,we should not bring lunch boxes which our mothers made but buy lunch boxes with our own money.But,we moreover pay money when we play in some clubs or circles.   For example,I belong to a cappella circle and a gardening club.  In a cappella circle,because a cappella circle members love singing songs,we often go to karaoke room in order to sing songs.We can sing songs in karaoke room with low price.So,you may think we need not pay much money,but we very often go to karaoke room.  In a gardening club,we suppose to go to bars twice in next week in order to become familier with the other members.We want to get good friends.Therefore,we need to have such chances.Then we must pay much money!   In this way,we need to have much money to enjoy our campus lives.To get the goal,we must get income by having a part-time job.So,I agree with this statement.  In fact,I am going to have a part-time job." 
"I agree this statement.  First,having a part-time job gives us ,college students, chances.The chances are for us learning money is very difficult and hard.Much of us would not think that getting money is so hard things.Becouse often we could get money from some relatives easily.Renently I have heard that a lot of new members of society would retire their company soon.It seems to me that one of the couses is that they did not spend their school days om working.If I would not experience working in my school days,I will be confused the hardness of reciving money in future.  Second,although it is my individual things, I have a lot of things that I want to do.For example,trip with my friend,learning cooking and getting drivers license.But those need so much money for me.So,I should have a part-time job and I want to use the money that I earned for me.  Finaly,we have much free time.Probably,It is only college student to have so much free time.So we should use the time effectively.I think that one of the means of spending the time on part-time job is so good.That is why I agree the opinion.  " 
I agree with this opinion because of two reasons. First of all, I think it is important to learn importance of money. We, majority of students, are given money, food, clothe, books Åcand almost everything that we should need by our parents or relatives. However we donÅft know that getting money is very difficult and hard, so we should have part-time jobs and learn importance of money. Second, we donÅft know about a system of our society and rules of our society. For example, we donÅft know how to manage a company or we donÅft know importance to keep our promise. It is very serious for us because we will have to work in there after our graduation. Therefore we should learn it from part-time jobs while we are students. I have a part-time job too. It is a cram school teacher. I teach my students on every Tuesday, Thursday and Friday but I can get only 30,000 yen/a month. In fact, I am impressed that getting money is very difficult and hard and I learn a lot of rules of our society from my part-time job. I feel that I could know my parentÅfs difficulties a little. For these reasons I agree with this opinion. 
"I agree this statement. This is because an experiment to have a part-time job will be useful when you work in the society. For example, if you have a lot of kind of part-time jobs, the experiment will enable you to talk about a lot of kind of subjects and you will become a popular person. If you have a part-time job at a convenience store, you will meet many kind of people, for instance the old, a woman who have children, a high school student and of coarse other college student. Then you will be able not to be afraid of talking with any kind of people. If you have a part-time job at the place where is the same kind as the place where you want to work, you will be able to know the job which you want to do. These experiments will improve your talent and you will grow up as human. Then you will get a weapon which you can use  in the society. People who do not have a part-time job cannot get it. This difference is very big. So I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job." 
"I agree with this opinion, because I think we should experience work and gradually accustom ourselves to the rule of our society. I have already had a part-time job. First I felt that I can do well, because my friend who started to work a month ago told me that job was very interesting. But it was not easier than I thought. When I am working, I feel the difference between customer and worker all the time. One day I did mistakes with which I got angry if I was customer. And after I felt disappointed very much. Another day I was told ÅgthanksÅh by a customer. And I felt very happy. I think this experiment is very important for me to become a member of society.   I think college students should pay the cost of living on oneÅfs own too. Until high school student, I took 2000 yen a month from my mother. So I used them for my pocket money, such as lunch, stationery, books, and arcade games. But now I am a college student who should prepare to stand on my feet. So I think we should pay them by my money which I earned. " 
"I agree with this statement. Because having a part time job grows up college students.   Å@First, we can know rules of society. For example, we can learn to keep a time, keep a promise and greet cheerfully or so. I think that these rules are very important things. .Second, we can know how difficult to get money. If we know that, we will not spend money in vain. This will be a good for us when we are independent on parents and live alone. We can also know the joy of getting money on our own. Å@Å@  Å@Finally, we can meet a lot of people by having a part-time job. Communicating many people, we can grow up. This is the fact that college students who engage in several kinds of part-time jobs often can not concentrate in studying in college. But I think we should not only study in school but also learn about society out of school while we are college student. It is most important for college students to study hard. But it is also important for us to learn a rule of society.  Å@ This is why I agree with this statement which it is important for college students to have a part-time job unless we have it too much.   " 
"I agree with first statment.  Because college students need money and need to practice work.  First, we are given free time like after school and holidays.  It is free for each other to past this time.  For example, to club, to study, to hobby, and to playing with friends.  But it takes much money to do those.  I think that earning moneys is necessary to canpus life.  But, most necessary thing for college students is to keep time to study.  We have to plan studying,  and after this,  make time to have a part-time job.  Next,  I think that most college students are short of the experience of work.  Because it is impossible to have a part-time job in many high school.  But,  we are allowed it in university.  I think that college students need to practice work.  Because this experiments will be necessary after graduating university.  I think that the most imporant thing is to keep time to study and have various experiments till graduating university.  If we could do first thing, I agree with this statement. " 
"I agree with an opinion that a college student should have a part-time job.    First, we can understand the mechanism of society a little by working  part-time.  Almost of we have worked little before, but itÅfs OK because we have a lot  of things to do in our high school days,   for example, club activity or study for examination etc.  But, I think that we need preparations to work so that we can live by  ourselves.  I have begun to work as the part-timer of the lecturer in a cram school  recently.  I wonder that I am excellent as I am called a teacher by children.  Because I am still a university student, the society does not watch me with  so strict eyes,   but I will not pardoned if I do similar thing after 4 years.    Second, we can reduce a financial burden to depend on our parents by working  part-time.  According to a certain data, higher than half of the university students  live apart from a parent.  I live in a home, but my older brother lives alone in Tokyo to go to  university.  Parents have to pay a rent or the food expenses as well as school expenses,  so we I think that we should earn the money to play by oneself.    I think the university student to work part-time from these reasons.  I want to have a various experience through a part-time job from now on. " 
"I agree with having a part-time job. Because working is precious experience and the thing that we should have responsibility for. So we can get much useful time in it. But I disagree with having it only for getting money. Because we should study in free time. So we should work to study. For example, if one wants to be a teacher, he should work at a juku to learn to teach children useful knowledge. And if one wants to be a sports trainer, he should work at gym to study useful knowledge about sports, health, and so on and to learn communicate with many people. In the other words, it is important for us to work at the place where there is the thing that we are interested in. So it is stupid thing to have a part-time job only for getting money. And when we work only for money, we waste so much time. We should have it in our minds that we have limited time. It has only four years. But if we use it usefully, four years is long, long time. So I agree with having a part-time job only if we have it for studying many precious things. " 
"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  We should do a lot of things in our life as many as possible. When we are college students, we have free time very much. So we have chance to do a lot of things.  We should have a part-time job even if only one because it teach us the importance of earning and working for people. My parents send me money now, so I do not know the importance of earning and working for people.  If I would not work until graduating KOBE University and I would start to work not as student, what happened to me? I think I could not go well in the company and the society because I do not know the importance of earning and working for people.  And a part-time job teaches us that it is hard and difficult to work to get money. No matter how hard we work for an hour, we often get 800 yen or so. Probably we think ÅgONLY 800!Åh  I think, when we understand those importance, we will know appreciate my parents as ÅgThanks to my parents working hard, I can go to KOBE University and learn.Åh That may be most importance of having a part-time job." 
"I agree with this statement. Because I think it is important for college students to study society through a part-time job. For example, there are two persons. They have equal ability, but one had never worked, and the other had worked when they were college students. If you employed one of them in your company, which would you choose? Many people would choose a person who had worked. Work is more difficult than those who had never worked expected. For example relation to workers together, stress by being criticized and so on. So it is necessary for college students to have experiences of work before they graduate from college. Moreover they should know how difficult is it to earn money. When they work, and are given salary at the first time, they will very happy. At the same time they will notice how hard it to work for money is. Therefore they thank their parents for working to raise them, and come to respect them. Of course, it is to study that the most important thing for college students is. However, these experiences are also important for them. They canÅft get these experiences in classes of college. So I think it is important for them to have a part-time job. " 
"I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Because we can learn how to do in society if we have a part-time job. Almost all of us do not know the manner to talk with senior people in society. So we need to learn how to talk with the senior people. Besides it is necessary for the students who live by themselves to have a part-time job. Because the students who live by themselves need some money to live. They must buy foods, clothes, soaps and so on. And they must pay charge of gas, water and so on. And we can make friends with the colleagues of the part-time job. And we can notice how important the money is by having a part-time job. So we will rarely get to waste our money. We will think carefully when we use our money. You think that if we have a part-time job, we will not get to study hard in college. But there are many people who have a part-time job and study very hard in college. Because of these reasons, I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. " 
I agree with this statement. I have worked at a convenience store until six months ago. I learned a lot of things from this experience.   Those who work at convenience store are always required to be kind for every customers. For example, when an old woman whose eyes are very wrong comes to our store, we must take money from her wallet ourselvies. When we find an injured man over the door, we must run and open the door for him to come in comfortably. When foreign people who cannot understand Japanese comes to use copy machine or ATM, we must operate the machine instead of them. Some customers donÅft say Ågthank you Åh. I was sometimes sad a little. However, occasionally I could feel happiness. For example, when the man who seems to be very quiet and angry said  Ågthank you Åh with smile, and when I can talk about the weather of the day with women who often come to our store, I was very glad. The customers of convenience store cannot be restricted to their age and work, so I could meet much kind of people who I could never see in campas. Thanks to this experience, I have learned skills to change a way of communication case by case.  It is important especially for college students to learn such a skill. That are reason I agree with the statement.  
"I agree with this opinion. There are three reasons. First, having a part-time job becomes social experiment. We are college students, so our main work is study. Working is hard. A part-time job is between adult and child. No. It is not exactly. I mean, having a part-time job is training for working. And we can get skill from a part-time job. Second, we can get money. College students have no money sometimes. It is important for college students to get money themselves. So they have a part-time job. In America, college students are independent to parents. Third, college students have a lot of free time. If college students donÅft have a part-time job, they have nothing to do without college. Of course, club activity is also important. But," 
"I agree this opinion because I think that college students should have chances of many kinds of experiences. There are many kinds of part-time job. For example tutor, bakery shop clue, event staff, cafe shop clue etc. By experience these part-time jobs, we can learn many skills and get politeness. People who want to be a teacher can know the way to teach if they experience a tutor. People who experience a shop staff can learn communication with strangers and get a manner.  And college students do not have uniform like high school students. So, they have to put on their own clothes.  Therefore, they need many clothes and they need a many amount of money. They should be dressed up!! So they should have a part-time job.  Surely the most important thing that college student should do is studying, but, to spend a wonderful school life, we need money. And now we are about 20 years old, we should not depend on parents so heavily. We are about to be independent.  So we should have a part-time job to make money for our pleasure. But the thing we must not forget is that we should not neglect studying by too hard working.  " 
I agree with this statement. Because, I think that we can learn important things when we do part time jobs. One reason is the following things,we can learn the true meaning of teamwork in almost all the part-time jobs. And Teamwork is useful when we have a job,because we can't work without using that,many tasks are not accomplished one person's effort ,and before work we need to learn about that,and need to know how important that thing. Second reason is that you get your own money. You can spend freely. Your hobby is more exciting things. And you can trip many places with using that money, trip may change your idea or your identity. Other reason is that we can know various type of people. To know various type of people may lead you to the success of getting well of your boss or your companion. You talk with various people ,you may become good listener ,and,of course,you become good speaker,you do not be able to learn that in school,become a good speaker or listener ,you must have more and more friend's .If you become good friend's , your daily life become more and more good thing,and your college life will be more enjoyable thing! 
"I think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job.  Why I think so is that college students are semi-working people. To work is one of the important things for people to live in a society. So I think to have a part-time job is important.  For example, I work in the private school as a teacher. In the work, I learn many things, that is to say, common senses. I think those senses are necessary to live in a society. Part-time job is very appropriate to practice to lead your life in society, I think.  And, to earn money is another thing important for college students. We are not working adults. But, we are not entirely children, too. So I think, college students have to work to earn money, which they use for them to go shopping, drink, or travel. The money for their leisure must be paid by their own. I ,too, pay my train fare.  Eventually, what I want to say is Ågpart-time job is a way to study what society isÅh. To learn that is difficult, so part-time job is surprisingly useful for that. If it was a trivial experiment, we study something advantageous for us. " 
"I agree with doing part-time job when we are in university. I have many reasons for my idea, but IÅfll show you three of them this time. I think they are very important.   First, part-time job gives us many friends. It is nice to have many friends. When we are sad, they cheer us. Especially when we have some trouble and we want my classmates not to know about it, my friends in office can help us.   Second, we can earn money. Perhaps, we have been given money by our parents. However we will have to earn money by ourselves for the future. We must manage the money. So we should learn how to use money which we get by ourselves while we are students.   Third we can experience working. Part-time job isnÅft full-time job; however we can know pleasure and pain which we get at work. Our employer may praise or scold us. My part-time job was cooking at the restraint. The other day I was forced to quit my job by my manager. Because I made many mistakes and I made the manager very angry. More over, I went to work only one day a week. So the manager told me that he wanted me to quit this job. I knew that it is severe to work. But this experience will be useful. " 
"I agree with the statement. I have two reasons. First, I think they can learn a part of society. Of course, they canÅft learn it completely. But, it is important to know society. When they graduate university, without knowing it, they will confuse. They may make mistakes from it. Second, they can get some skills. For example, skill of communication,expert or general knowledge. Perhaps, the knowledge which they get to have a part time job are influenced their future. Especially, I think skill of communication is very important. Of course, there is difference of skill of it. But, in our life, we canÅft live without communication. It is base of life. And, it is sure that the person who has high ability of it is liked. I tell you two reasons I agree with this statement until now. But, I want to except a case. We are university students. We passed the hard entrance examination to study something. If they can not study because of part time job, I donÅft agree this statement. Part time job is said ÅgarbeitÅh by Japanese. I think this word ÅgarbeitÅh come from German. The word is ÅgarbeitenÅh. This word means ÅgworkÅh in English. But, when students use this word, it means ÅgstudyÅh in English. So, the work of students are studying. We enter this university to study. From this reason, I think studying is first priority and part time job is second. Therefore, in this case, I disagree with it." 
"I think, it is important for college students to have a part-time job.Why I think so? There are two reasons.  I have a part-time job. I began it since the last spring. In that job, I have learned so many things to suit for society- --Call for customer, how to apologize, how to receive the phone, and so on.We, a college students, should learn and acquire the rule of real society until we take a job. In this respect, a part-time job is the best place to learn and acquire it. That is the first reason. Second reason is that if we have a part-time job, we can meet many kinds of friends. We can get various vision of life from their friends. ThatÅfs why I think that a part-time job is important. If you do the part-time job, you can know wrong part of you. This makes you a good adult.   " 
"I agree with the opinion that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. It is because I have many reasons about that.   The first reason is that we college students will be able to experience social life and will be able to acquire social career. When we get a job and begin to work, the experience of part-time jobs will help us in many situations. For example, some people who belong to shops in a part-time job are able to use ÅgreziÅh, some who belong to restaurants in a part-time job are able to cook or know the importance of washing hands.  The second reason is that we can get money. Before starting a part-time job, many students have never gotten such a lot of money. So we can learn how to use a lot of money. I think that most of college student have a part-time job especially to get money.  The third reason is that we can make many friends in the place of part-time jobs. Many friends senior to us or junior to us give us a lot of knowledge and information and sensation. They may cause development to us.  There are some other reasons. I think that we college student had better not study only in the college. A part-time job is the good place we can learn the life.     " 
I think it is very important for college students to work a part-time job. First reason, we, college students are almost members of society, and we are going to have to work at an organization few years later. Therefore I think we have to practice to work at an organization, and to work a part-time job is the best occasion for it. If we are still in a student mood when we enter a company, we are scolded and said familiar words ÅgWhat are recent young men!Åh by our bosses or superiors. For it wonÅft be so, we should acquire manners as a member of society, how to talk respect words, and so on while we are college student who have much time. Even a part-time job, when working as a part of society, we can learn those important things. Second, I think it is miserable that a college student who is close to 20 years old depends on their parents. There seem to be a member of society called ÅgParasite singleÅh, but it is ashamed that a college student gets money from their parents. From above two reasons, I think it is important to work a part-time job, and college students should work a part-time job.  
"I think that it is important for college students to have part-time job because part-time job may give them precious experiences.   First of all, they could know work is very hard and important. They could notice that their parents do works everyday for their family. And they may thank their parents. We canÅft live without works.  Second, they are taught importance of money by getting salary by their self. Most of them may often save money when they go shopping because they donÅft want to lose the money they get hard. They may plan how to use it, for example traveling, shopping and their hobby.  Third, their experiences will be useful when they get a job after graduate from their college. They could practice works in real atmosphere and know a lot of systems in working situation.  Also they are given many chances to find work they want to do by doing many kind of part-time job.   However they have to study in college life. They passed entrance exam to study many subjects at college. But it is important for college students to have part-time job, they should have part-time job not to disturb their study. As a result of these things they could also use time well.    " 
" I agree with that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. It is because there are two reasons.  First of all, it means studying society to have a part-time job. When we graduated from college, we are not students and should work somewhere. Wherever we work, It is useful the experience of working and earn moneys.  A lot of cases, even if student make mistakes, he is excused.  However, man take a job   is not. It is dangerous that take a job you have no experience.  Next, college students need moneys. We have a lot of time. Of course we should study, but we donÅft want to study only. Then, we belong to club, go to karaoke with friends, have a lunch, take a trip, study abroad etcÅc Only college student can do these things. These things enable us to make really friends and wonderful memories. That is very important. However, we need moneys to do that. So we have to have a part-time job. There are students who pay school expense themselves. They must have a part-time job to study. We have things that we want to do or must to do. Perhaps it is more important for you to do that than studying.  So we need moneys.   Therefore, I agree with that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  " 
"I agree with this statement. This is because, I think it will be a good experience to work as part-timers during we are college students. An experience gained in working will not be an obstacle thing but useful in the real world. For example, we can appreciate the worth of money or learn to take a well-mannered attitude. And also in our college lives, we will spend a lot of money for a party with our friends or mates, club activities, buying ourselves new clothes or bags and so on. So I think we should work and get money by ourselves, if possible. On the other hand, some people may say that we should not have a part-time job. Of course we must study hard. If we spend a lot of time rather working than studying, we will make the meaning of entry of this college be completely worthless. So we must manage to study and take part-time jobs at the same time, if we take them. It is very difficult. But I think taking a part-time job in our college lives brings us various experiences rightly or wrongly. But I donÅft have any part-time job now. So IÅfm looking for." 
"I think it is important for college students to have a part time job. We have a lot of events in college life. For example club activity and drinking party. So we must make money. Until we are high school students, we get money by our parents. But college students are nearly adult or truly adult. So we should have a part time job to make money by ourselves. But then some people may say that college students should not spend their time to do a part time job, they should spend the time to study. I think that the idea is not wrong. It mai be best if we can do. But it is very difficult to do such. In fact I have some friends who don't have a part time job. They don't study hard and they get money to enjoy various events by their parents. I don't like such a way very much. I think that students who have a part time job can finish their homework earlier than who don't have it do. The students who don't have it may think that they have a lot of time,so they can do homework anytime. Due to that, their start to do homework may be late. And I think it is also important for us to experience a part time job. I think study,club activity,part time jobs etc all things are a part of college life." 
"I agree with the opinion. For one reason, college students should experience earning money for themselves during their campus life. It is very important for them to realize how hard to get money because students these days are too dependent on their parents without any appreciation. They should appreciate that they can go to college. Actually, I started to live alone near my college and to do a part-time job. It is very hard work and I realized how hard it was to work for a living. I think every students had better realize it and it will be very good experience when they get jobs after their graduation.   For another reason, they can broaden their views. If students donÅft belong to any club activities, their community must be very narrow. People they will encounter should be limited. Thorough part-time jobs, they can come across various people and exchange many opinions. Such encounters are very important for their future. Almost all of college students these days have no ideas what they want to be in the future. Therefore, it is also very good experience to seek their dreams.  Campus life is only 4 years, but we are allowed to be free no less than 4 years!!Time is very precious, so we must not spoil our time. Part-time jobs are one of experiences that you can do only while you are young. Thus, I agree that opinion.    " 
"I donÅft agree that college students work part time. It is because two reason.  In the first place, college students have to study hard. Once, they studied hard to entrance examination. Why they wanted to pass the entrance exam? It is they wanted to translate dreams into a reality. So if they want to do that still now, they have to continue studying even now. But they canÅft study hard if they work part time. They canÅft study hard because they canÅft take time to do so. If they work part time hard, he canÅft study and they fail them test.    In the second place, part time job make some money. You know it is a little money, but it is a lot of money for college students. Most of college students spend money on pleasure and their hobby. Only a part of students saves money. If you spend all your money, you will have nothing. I think that young people should give themselves up to sports, studying, or club activities. Surely, money is important in our life, but it is not everything. You should not always work part time, or your heat will be satisfied.   ThatÅfs whyáTdonÅft agree that college students work part time.  " 
I think it is important for college students to have part time job. This is because we can get precious experience from the part time job. The experience will help us to find the job that we want to do. For example, my part time job is mathematics teacher in cram school. I like the job because teaching math makes students and me smart. I feel happy when we become smart. And I get happier when I hear thanks from my students. This is why I have become want to be a cram school teacher. And other reason for having part time job is money. We need much money for enjoy our school life. If we donÅft have our own money, when we have dinner with girl friend or boy friend, we take a trip with friends and we take place a party with our circle friends, we canÅft take part in there. But we need also time. We must study and make report like this. I think it is very important and necessary for college students to have part time job. But I think it is most important for college students to balance between part time job and studying.  
I think colleges students to have a part time job is Important. Many students have a lot of time after school. Maybe part time job is one of best thing to do after school same as club activity or playing with friends. If students saved the money with part time job, they could travel overseas in spring or summer breaks or bought what they want. And they know how to use money with plan per month. Sometime in part time job happen accident which donÅft  happen in school. To deal with that accident makes him  good. In the future he happen accident again, he will not confuse at that timing. Part times job also can make friends are other school or company. I think it is good thing to make many friends in several spaces.  And I think itÅfs also good thing working with person who donÅft like. Because not every person fit me. On the other hand some students absent his class with his part time job. Without saying itÅfs too bad thing. Part time job is important but most important thing for students is studying.  If forget that thing, part time job makes bad or vacant thing his college life.   
 It is important for college students to have a part- time job.    I agree that the part-time job is important for college student.  Of course the most important reason is to make money to live. But for that, I must save money.  However, the purpose is not only money. We can get more many things.  I have been working part-time job for about two years. I have learned many things there.  First of all, I learned communication skills. During working, I am taking communication with colleague.   Next, I learned that working is very hard.   I was surprised that working is so harder than I thought.  I feel money is so importantÅ@and valuable. I think I have to the importance of money.  When working at the society in my near future, that experience should be useful. 
"It is important for college students to have a part-time job. I agree this opinion. I have some reasons. First, it is good to experience a part-time job. Everyone will become a working member of society in the near future. Having a part-time job is preparation for being it. Actually, I began to work at the wedding reception. My work is to serve foods and drinks, to give good service and to prepare the table sets etcÅc I must learn many many things (manners, special terms, menu, customs, behaviorÅc) by heart and many times I was scolded by my boss when I failed. But, I could understand a lot of things there. For example, to work is severe, a pay is weight, it is important to be responsible for my work, and so on. Working there is very hard, but I feel that I am very glad to work worth doing.  Secondly, college students have a free time. If you need some money for what you want to do, you should get money not from your parents but by working on your own. So you will find money important and appreciate your parents who work for you.  For the reasons stated above, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. " 
"I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.I think that college students have to play.If they don't play,they are not college students.But,when they play,they need much money.Therefore,they must have a part-time job to earn money for their play.Some adults say that it is not important for collge students to have a part-time job,but I can't understand their idea.This is because college students work for not only theirselves but also our society.After they earn,they spend for their play,and business become active,and adults enjoy high salaries.In other words,evepyone become happy by college student's part-time job.But,college students must not only play but also study.I think that it is bad that college students who don't study hard have part-time job.Therefore,I think that they need to live hard.College student need to eat food,drink,wear clothes,take a bath,brush his or her teeth,ride a bicycle,love others,wash clothes,wash  dishes,watch television,listen to music,communicate with various people,study hard,play hard and work hard for not only himself or herself but also his or her society." 
"I agree with the idea that college students should have a part-time job, because by doing so, they can get a various of experiences.  Some people may say that to have a part-time job interrupts to study for college students and in addition, working as part-time jobber lets college students have the view that working is only the mean to earn money, and they come not to contribute to the society, like doing volunteer. Moreover, as there are many other enjoyable things in the college, just doing part-time job not others is so waste for them.  However, I donÅft think so. The reason is that to have a part-time job doesnÅft necessary prevent college students from studying or other activities, because having only to plan efficiently, even if they work, they have enough time to study. They may do a high performance, rather, by living a busy and planned life. Furthermore, as I said first, having a part-time job gives them rich experiences. For example, by doing part-time job, they get a chance to meet a lot of people, and working in the school days makes them know how to behave in the society like a follow thing ; when people talk with their boss, they must talk respecting him. In this way, I strongly think to have a part-time job is very profitable for college students" 
"I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are three main reasons. The first reason is that many college students live by themselves. They come from all over Japan and some of them become independent of their parents in money. They have a lot of things to pay, so they need to work in order to make their living cost. Besides, they need much money in particular, because new college students must buy new textbook.  The second reason is that college students can learn the social system if they start to have a part-time job. A part-time job is probably the first job for much of them, so they should have strong sense of responsibility. And they understand the value of money and find themselves one of the members of society.  The third reason is that college students have much time. After school, they have free time, for example some people do their club activities, other people study hard. They should try to challenge what they want to do, and they had better undergo various experiences in their school days.  In conclusion, I think that a part-time job is important for college students. " 
"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have some reasons why I agree. One reason is that we can earn some money. Two months have past since we entered a college, and I think we need more money than ever. For example, I have more opportunities to have dinner with friends and to go shopping. And if we earn some money, we can notice how important money is. So we need to earn money for ourselves. Second reason is that we can make many friends. If we have part-time job, we can meet different people from those who we can meet at a college. There may be a person who is older or younger than you. And so, by talking with them, we can share our thoughts and make more friends. Last reason is that we can learn manners. When we talk with customers, we have to speak politely. Before we become a member of society, we should learn manners. So while we are college students, we should have a part-time job. Of course, we should study hard because we are college students. But I think if we have time to do something, we should have a part-time job." 
"In my opinion,I think  that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.There is a some reasons. You may say that it is not good for students to have a lot of money.However,if they have a lot of money ,their life will be happy and rich. It leads to reducing the burden of the parent that university students  work part-time.Furthermore,acquaintances open by working part-time and can load society experience more or less. There will be surely the opinion not to have too much money.But the life that I did not well is necessary,and that therefore students works part-time should be understood to concentrate on study and club activities.That is why I agree to students working part-time." 
"I think so too, because having a part-time job benefits us. Through doing part-time job we can learn many things we need to learn.     The first thing is what we can become polite. When we do part-time job, we have to work as a clerk of a store or company. So, we have to greet, talk to consumers politely.  We can learn the manner which we have to get in the future. If we donÅft have this manner, we could not get job.    The next thing is responsibility. We have to be responsible for our task, because part-time job is not play. This responsibility is necessary after we graduate from college and when we start to work for company.     Then, we can learn how important money is. We do hard works and get money. This hard works tell us the importance of money. It isnÅft until we get money we earned that we realize the really value of money.    Through the part-time job, we can experience our society and realize what our society is. We can become a member of our society.    Moreover, college students have much free time. College is not as busy as high school. We college student should make the most use of this free time. It is best time to do part-time job.    For those reason, I think college students should do part-time job.        " 
"I agree that.     I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job because two reasons.     First, we must study except for academic things, too.  After graduation, many of them will be pushed for time as a true member of society. But itÅfs very hard to take part in a society without arrangements. So I think we should have a part-time job as arrangements of a member of society. There are many important things which we can study only through the working.   And we must know how money is precious. If we live by only parentÅfs income, and get allowances, we canÅft realize real value. However we understand its value in mind, itÅfs nonsense. Seeing is believing. We can realize it precious only own experience.     Second, I think we should do something while we are college students because for many students campus life is final time which they can use freely.   For example traveling abroad, to learn how to drive, however they are very expensive. So we need a lot of money. But its true value rise when we carry out from preparation of money to practice on our own.         I think we can spend time efficiently this series of flow by having a part-time job.   4 years is too short to waste.  " 
" I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are three reasons why I agree.    First, you can get money. In college school life, you need much money to buy books, go shopping with friends, drink with members of club activity, and so on. So if you have a part-time job, you can use money as you want. As for me, I have a part-time job for the trip to meet my host family in Canada with a friend of mine.    Second, you can make new human relations. There are many generations in a work place. For example, owner, a person who is a housewife and a person who belongs to other college. If you don't have a part-time job, you make friends in only your university.    And last, you can grow larger as a member of society.  When you were child, you were protected enough. But as you grow up, you have to manage yourself. So you can learn  many things through a part-time job. For example, a friend of mine works at cram school. She seems to be busy preparing for her class. But she always says that she can have a responsible for her students and learn many things from them. Thus, there are many advantages about having a part-time job. In order to make your school life more benficial, you should have a part-time job." 
"I think that it is importantfor college students to do part-time jobs. First this is because they have to spend much money for playing,traveling,club activities and so on.If they don't spend money for playing,they will need a lot of money for commuting to university. If you were a high school student,your parents would pay the cost when you want to buy something.But college students should not depend on their parents so much,and they should try to lead independent lives. Of course,I don't insist that it is bad for themm to receive economical supports from their parents.I just want to say that it is important for them to earn money,even if the salary is low. Second this is because they can't waste their own salary.They can learn how difficult people earn money by doing part-time jobs.So when they spend money,they think carefully whether the cost is proper or not.The difficulty of earning money prevent them from wasting money. Third this is because doing part-time jobs is the practice to be a respectable member of society.They will understand the rule of the society while they are working.college students are generally regarded as adults.So they have to contribute to the society.Doing part-time jobs is the large part of college students duty.In order to enjoy the college  life they have to work hard." 
"I think that a part-time job is important to university students. The reason why a part-time job is important is that we can experience various things and learn our view of life through experience of working. For example, I have a part-time job tutoring a high school student who is my friendÅfs sister in mathematics and science. At first I thought it easy to teach her their subject because I was good at mathematics and science when I was a high school student. In addition, I was not serious since my student is my friendÅfs sister. But I realized that I was wrong to think it easy to teach her when I visited my friendÅfs home and taught her. I did not realize that thinking is different from real teaching until I taught her in practice. After I realized my mistakes, I learned difficulty of teaching others and responsibility to work through this experience. Other part-time job gives us valuable experience, too. That is why I think that we take responsibility for our action as a number of society through part-time jobs. And I think that studying is important when we are university student, but I think that having a part-time job may be important and valuable more than studying. So I want to go on trying to have a part-time job." 
"I think it is important for college students to have a part time job. I think there are some reasons. First, it goes without saying that the main reason is to earn money. College students need some money for meals and clothes and so on. So we should have a part time job. Second, we can have many good experiences by having a part time job. For example, we can learn what a job is like and how severe a job is through a part time job. And we can also learn manners in the society. These experiences will be very useful when we get a job. Third, we can get on good terms with colleagues. There are many college students who have a part time job. So we can make friends with other college students. If we donÅft have a part time job, we can only make the same college students. So it is very good thing to have a part time job. These are the reasons why college students should have a part time job. College students have so much time, so they should use their time efficiently. I think a part time job is one of the best ways to use their time efficiently. " 
"I agree with the statement that college students should have a part-time job.  First there is no doubt that people who have had a part-time job must be equipped with normal sense of money because such people are able to know the importance of money and would not like to waste their money.   Second, college students who have a part-time job are able to experience strictly of working. One reason is that as their superiors and seniors scold them they are going to begin to feel the sense of insecurity and they must be going to develop mature as person.   Third they are likely to communicate with various people and learn how to get along with people particularly the service.  Forth I think that the recent trend of collegeÅf students trying to have a part-time job aggressively will have a good influence on them. Because by making much more of an effort to do the job well, there will be more opportunities for college students to think about the job.  Last I think that having a part-time job means not only getting much money but also contributing to society. For these reason I am in favor of the opinion that college students should have a part-time job.   " 
"I agree with this statement. One of the reasons for this is that collage students should understand the meaning of working. For example, if we have a part time job, we need to be punctual, to care of our appearance, and to greet everyone. So we can know the manner of working, and we can act fittingly as workers. Of course, when we graduate from college, we are regarded as workers by persons around us, and we are demanded to do as workers naturally. So we have to acquire the way of polite action by graduating from college. It is true that we can learn about etiquette as persons who live in society, in college group such as club activities, but we can experience how hard it is to get money only when we work in fact. In fact, from my experience of part time job, I realize that my thought about job was so easy. If I did not have a part time job, I would go out in society with wrong thought, face to unexpected hard society and be disappointed. Therefore, some people say that part time job is a just way of getting money, but I think that it is a important opportunity for us to learn what is important to work. " 
"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.There are some reasons I think so.Frist,college students often spent somemoney,for example,clothe  ,party,travelÅc So,they must earn money for some extend.With little money,our college life becomes very miserable.In my case,I didnÅft buyÅ@many things and seldom go to play in the last year of my high-schooldays,to  pass the entrance exam.And I have thought that when I pass the exam and become a college student,I do all things I want to do.I have passed exam,so, all I have to do is do all my favorite things. For it,I have a part-time job and do what I want to do.Second,a experience of working is needed to be a good adult.Working gives us another point of view,for instance,I was only a buyer,but I can be a seller and I can see another aspect of the world.In my case,I wanted to work in a restaurant and receive a appointment.And I went there just on time without no doubt,and after meeting,a man came to me and said thatÅuDo you have any common sense?You  had to come here at least before 5minutes.ItÅfs too rude.If  you do such thing next,you canÅft work here! ÅvI said nothing but I was very angry because I thought thatÅuI know it is good to do so,someone said it.But I was said it is good to go just on time,because to go early is very annoying thing.Åv I had had bad impression about the restaurant for a few days,but oneday  I noticed.Everyone has their own idea and there isnÅft true thing,and we must accord our ideas.It is me who must change my idea to the restaurant.We must study our society like this.So,college student should have a part-time job.   " 
"I think it is very important for college school students.We need so much money.For example if I live by myself,we waste money.So I need to earn money.This is most important reason.I think there are two other reasons    First,club activity.We had better join any clubs.Because,we can make many friends.I think our duty is experiencing many kinds of thing.We must challenging many kinds opf thing.But it will make us waste so much money.We need money to get great experience.    Second,we must know society.Though it will make us know a little world,it will help us someday.In brief,part-time job is learning of society.Maybe a person who doesn't work can't understand inportance of money.There is difference between thinking and doing.It may be great experience in that sort of meaning.    This is why I think part-time job is important for us.But,I must not remenber that most important thing is school work.Our duty is experiencing many kinds of thing and schoolwork.I thinkl great college school student is the person who can do all things perfectly. " 
"I think that college students should have a part-time job once. We are going to have a good experience for their future by having a part-time job. Part-time job is a good experience for to become a member of society. We can experience social responsibility and strict in advance by having a part-time job. These experience is good effects our future. And, because school days, we can have a many experience. If there are interesting, we should do it. Even if there are not interesting, we should have a part-time job to find sense. But, we become students to study. We should study. If we take all the time in school days to part-time job, we could not study enough and it is bad effects for our future. It is wrong that you have a part-time job without study and only study without have enough experience. We should have a part-time job and we also should study. So we should use time efficiently to study and have a good experience. Using time efficiently is also necessary to become a member of society.  So I think that college students should have a part-time job.  " 
"I also think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have two reasons. First, college students need much money for parties or ÅgnomikaiÅh. Of course, college students have not to join these. But if they join ÅgnomikaiÅh, they will get something by talking with older college students. Then it will make their college life more meaningful and help them make more friends. In other word, college students need much money for making much more circumstance around them.  Second, some college students live alone. They have to get money for eating or living. Of course, their parents may give them some money. But it usually runs short. So, it is important for them to have a part-time job. Also, some people go to college from far place. They need money for expensive fare or buying bike. If college studentsÅf having a part-time job were banned, they would not go to college. In brief, they have a part-time job for surviving or going to college.  It is true that college students should study. But I think that college life is not only studying but also experiencing various things to live at society. That is why it is important for college students to have a part-time job." 
"In my opinion, college students should have a part-time job.  First reason, college students are said to be a work adults. But I think that we cannot understand real society until we work in there. Seeing is believing.  At second, college students have a summer vacation for two months. What are you going to do in summer vacation? Most people accept to study is a studentÅfs duty. I agree this opinion. But I think most students cannot study everyday for two months in fact.   At third, we have came college from many places. This is why we do not have so many real friends. When we have a part-time job, we can make real friends in other colleges and human relations so easily. If we have human relations, we will be helped by it when we were in troublesome. Perhaps we can have a precious boy or girl friend.   At fourth, we can get money by working. We can freely buy anything, play games, and go anywhere, and so on. But only exciting is not a value of making money. When we make money by ourselves, we would understand real value of money. If we understand it, we will not waste our money.   At Last, we will get a job in a future. If we had a part-time job, its experience would be useful.   Many college students have each part-time job. We should have a part-time job. It will be very good experience surely. " 
"I agree with the statement. Because I believe that college students should experience a lot of things. In order to live in this world, you need some ability. And it is experiences that give you them. Part-time job provide you with not only money but also experiences. For example, when you success in the job, you can get confidence. When you make some mistakes, you can have a chance getting any solutions. And they will be your skills to do well in this society in the future. Of course there are many things you cannot experience through part-time job. But you will earn money. You could do a lot of things as trip, studying abroad, shopping or love.   Part-time job is just Ågkill two birds with one stone.Åh for college students because not only above reason but also you have time and you are free. That is to say you give time and freedom. Why? I believe that society give you the last chance to fly away into the severe world. So you should experience many things to do well in this society. This is important. And I think the best way is Part-time job. Therefore I agree with the statement. " 
"I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are two reasons I think so. First we need much money to spend our   life, for example, buying some clothes or playing with our friends or commuting from our home to our college and so on. If we donÅft have a part-time job, our parents have to pay for doing that. We owe spending our school life to our parents. The much money we use without having a part-time job, the more trouble they have. Second I think that having a part-time job become very nice experience for us. We didnÅft have so much time doing it because of club activities or study for entrance examination. Now, we can make more time before. Doing it helps us study about society and something helping us some day. Some people may say that we donÅft need doing it because we can learn it after we graduate college. But I think that we need many experiences through having a part-time job during we are college students because there are many things we canÅft do after we leave in society. So I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. " 
"I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are three reasons for this.  Firstly, if we have a part-time job, we will be able to develop our ability to communicate with people. When we work at an office or a shop, we have to communicate with people who work there and it becomes important to tell them what we think exactly. For example, when we have some troubles with our work, we have to tell regular employees who work there what trouble we have. I think that part-time job give us a chance to learn how to communicate with people.  Secondly, we will be able to change our view of money by earning money ourselves. Today, there are many things that are very convenient, for example, a cellular phone or a computer, and many students want them. We might buy them by money which we got without efforts such as an allowance, but once we work and get money with efforts, we will learn how important money is.  Thirdly, we will be able to form a sense of responsibility. When we work at our office, we must have responsibility to our work. If we have a part-time job, we will be able to do all things with responsibility in our daily life. " 
I agree to the statement that it is important for college student to have a part-time job. First, when we are college student, we have much free time. So we can do many things except to study. For example, buy something, go to a trip, play with friends, and get a qualification. And if we want to do them, we need some money. But we should not always rely on our parents about money. We should work a part-time job to get money ourselves to do them. Second, it is very valuable experience for us to work a part-time job. We donÅft know in practice what to do in a job. But we can experience it when we have a part-time job. We will have to choose what to do in the future. It is very difficult and important for us. To work a part-time job may change our view about a job and helpful to choose it in the future. Third, we can practice how to do in society in a part-time job. We need to learn how to do in society. But we can not learn all of them in college. And if we learn them after graduation, it is little late for us. So we need to have a part-time job, and practice them. This is the reason why I agree the statement.   
"I agree this statement.   First of all it is because the college student should not only study. I think that it is important for the college student to experience part-time job when he or she works in society in future. But, if the college student neglected studying, it is putting the cart before the horse. The balance of studying and part-time job is also studying. I think that part-time job is the first step which he or she experiences society. So, he or she will have various experiences,Å@but those all are called society. If he or she donÅft such an experience and come out in society, he or she will be instantly confused. ThereforeÅ@he or she should have such an experience as soon as possible.  Second, probably most college students had gotten allowance until now. So, he or she understood difficulties of earning money. If he or she works at a part-time job, he or she will be able to understand correctly the importance of money and difficulties of earning job.  If he or she does so, he ore she will not waste instantly.  Naturally there are other various opinions. It is sure that there are bad points in which studying tends to be neglected etc. However he or she will get things beyond them.  From the above statement I agree this theme.   " 
"I agree with this statement. We college students should have a part-time job.  One reason is that we need much money. If we belong to some club, we often hold a banquet. And we sometimes go shopping and take a trip with club members or friends. We spend much money on many things. If we donÅft have enough money, we canÅft enjoy a precious campus life. We can only enjoy it once. Another reason is that we have to experience many jobs. We will get some job in the future. For this, we have to experience many jobs and know how working is and how we communicate with fellow workers and seniors. Unless we donÅft gain enough experience, we may fail to some job and not communicate with people well and lose some job. We are already eighteen, nineteen or twenty. We are not children. We are adults. We should not depend on our parents. We have to live our own lives in the future. So, we have to become real adults. However, there are some problems. Firstly, we should not have too many part time jobs. These may make us tired and we may not study. Secondly, we have to select a right job. We should not have a part-time job which we fit with. If we know these problems, we can enjoy a part-time job. " 
"I agree with the statement. I think that it is important for college students  to have a part-time job. And, maybe I am going to have a part-time job soon.  I am going to explain why I agree with it by three reasons.  First, almost all of the college students have little money. They want to buy  a lot of clothes, video games, books,and so on and play with their friends. B ut they do all of what they want, their wallet will be empty as soon as they d o.  So they need money every time.  Second, college students have a lot of free time. They have no classes on Sat urday and Sunday, and they have very long vacation in summer and spring. I thi nk that it is impossible to spend all of the free time for playing. They shoul d not spoil the free time.  Third, part-time job is studying about earning. Young people have little idea  about society, especially job. But, their fathers (or their parents) are earn ing for them. They should know how difficult to earn 1 yen, and appreciate the ir parents. If students have a part-time job, they will not waste any money.   So I agree with the statement. If you are a college student and don't have a  part-time job, you should have it as soon as you can. " 
"I agree that college students have part-time job. It is because their parents pay much money for them to college. So college students work themselves and if they want to buy something, they should buy it themselves. They do so; they can start to independent from their parents. After they graduate college, they must work. So I think that they should feel severity of working. Someone who disagree that college students have part-time job say that studying is more important than having part-time job, but I do not think so. It is sure that studying is very important.Å@But having part-time job is also very important.Å@For example it teaches them importance of money. Importance of money can not be taught them in school.  If college student wants to have part-time job, I never stop. But if he or she stops studying because of fatigue of part-time job, I advise him or her to retire from this job. It is because it is not enough human to live in society that he or she can only work. I think that studying is the most important job for college students. And I think that having part-time job is also important thing for college students.     " 
"I agree with the idea that college students have a part-time job.  I have two reasons about the opinion.     First, I think that most of college students are about 18 years old. So, we are enough old to be independent with our parents about money.  Until I was high school student, my parents gave me money to play with my friends and buy clothes. Because my high school banned to have part time job.   SO I can't get money by myself. But, in our college we are allowed to take part-time job.   I think we must do our own things by myself. We will have to be independent from our parents someday.     Second, to have various social experiences through part-time job is very important.  My parents work every day for us, but we don't know how hard to work every day is. We have to understand how hard and appreciate my parents.  And, we can contact with people that have different ideas from us through part-time job.  We had better to have various ideas and experiences to become decent people.  We will have new idea from work.  More ideas we have, more decent we are.     So I agree with the idea that it is important to have a part time job. " 
"I think that college students need to have part time jobs, because I believe that they should earn theirs living money.     Why should college student have part time job?  Certainly, first of all that college student must do at is studying hard to graduate from a university as soon as possibly, but they by donÅft pay theirs tuition fees by themselves. Tuition fees are paid by their parents. Furthermore, some college student rent one-room apartment, some of them donÅft pay fees that they rent apartment. Those fees also are paid by their parents.     Then, what should college student do? What can do to help their parents? That is earning their living money by themselves. We, college student, should consider that our parents donÅft force us to go college, but allow us to go it. In other words, we, college student, should gratitude to our parents for going college. So college student should reduce load of parents that they paid for us. We must do the minimum thing that we con do by ourselves.     Accordingly, I think that college students must have part time job to earn their living money for helping their parents, and study hard to graduate from a university.  " 
"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.     The reason why doing a part-time job is good thing for college students is that working students get sociability. And they feel themselves a part of society. When they notice that themselves work hard, they are glad that they are a member of society. Then young people feel respectable man.  And they also recognize the importance of money. If they do, they waste no more money even if they have not done until now.     In my case, when I was a high school student, I did a part-time job. At the time I felt working to be very flesh. And by working, I felt becoming adult human a little. And I became to waste no more money without notice.     It is true that some of them work so hard that they could not go to college or do not study but work hard.  But the problem is balance of things. Everybody could have at least a little free time. They should use it effectually. So they could spend good time.     This is why I agree that college students do a part-time job.  I think that our college should encourage doing a part-time job more.    " 
"I agree to have a part-time job by college students.  Firstly, it is important for college students to earn money by themselves. If they worked , they were realized that money is valuable.  Secondly, they can know the real society. And, this experience is sure to help your working in the company.  Finally there are many people and they are several ages. So you speak senior people or younger people and you can know the way to respect older people. To be sure , you careful of your phrase. These experiences are inevitable for us to survive.  Indeed part-time job spare they their time and they can not study hard. I also think that college studentÅfs work is studying.  But it is more important for human to enjoy with friends than only studying.  In case of friends is including colleague. Nowadays, most young people hardly communicate their opinion for other people. Because they spend all of time in their home. I strongly suggest that to go to anywhere and to speak many people.  So I think that to have a part-time job is important for college students. " 
"When you are asked what you do a part-time job for,Å@ Can you find more reinforced word than money? Needless to say, earning money is what part-time job is all about. Demerit is only that there some possibility you can use that time more meaningfully, or that you will not have much time to sleep well. But when it come to Japan university student, who are most likely to lead a rough life this weak point is meaningless. So in term of this, part-time job is most useful for university student.  Aside from earning money, part-time job has some merits. Of course, it is small in comparison with the first one. But if you do various job, it might become bigger fortune than real money. It is a social experience. This is not thing you can get immediately, and difference of people whether they have it or not is clear. But no one choose the job by this merit. Easiness and per an hour salary is most important to select money-making place. So this is merely incidental merit.   That is to say whether part-time job is important or not depend on whether you have enough money or not. So for most of student, it is importantÅC but if you had enough money, you should do anything but part-time job. " 
"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. The first reason is that I think a part-time job is one of the experience program in job.  When I was a junior high school student, my school made such a program.  It called ÅgTry yaru weekÅh.  Then I go to the fire station.  I decided that I will be a fire fighter through the experience.  And the second reason is that we cannot manage for money. College students often eat and drink with their friends.  In other words, they use much money to eat and drink.  If they donÅft have a part-time job, they cannot do that.  And their friends may think that the person is no good in companionship.  Unluckily it may cause a quarrel, and cut down his friends.  Third reason is that they want the money to buy various things.  In my case, I want to buy fashionable cloths.  But they are too expensive to buy.  Therefore I think that a part-time job is important for college students.  But we are college students, arenÅft worker.  It is most important for us to study!!  We must not only have a part-time job but also study.  We must not forget that why do we go to KOBE university! " 
"I agree with the idea.     It is because that working at part time job is very good chance to learn a lot of things.  For example how to communicate with people at official situation and how hard to get money is.     Although there are many people who disagree with it because working at cram school or home teacher is too high wage for college or university student, I donÅft think so.  There are two reasons.  At first, working at these jobs will be very good and rare chances to learn how to teach or tell other people what they want to teach or tell.  Next, I think that too high wage is not totally wage but hourly wage.  Generally speaking, because college or university student have to attend a lot of class, they donÅft have much time for part time job.  And they need so much money to play with their friends or to buy clothes.  Especially, students who live alone have to get a lot of money to pay fee for house, energy, gas, and so on.  Even though they do high hourly wage jobs, their totally wage will fit their life style.     College or university students are likely to have more time when they are free for classes than high school students.  They shouldnÅft use the time to do nothing or sleep but also should use it very effectively.  It usually means to do part time job or to study.  So they should study in college or university and do part time job out of there.   " 
"I agree with that idea. Of course it is the most important thing for college students to study what they will use in their future, such as their majors and common senses, and I think so, too. But I also think that it is important for them to experience various things. Most of those who have a part-time job can gain not only money for their work, but also what is important to live their lives, such as the way to communicate with people and to know how important it is to be responsible for what they do or say. Moreover, while most of us have to choose our own jobs which we will have done until we become around 60 before we graduate from the colleges, we have too little information to do so when we enter them. Therefore, to make up the shortage of it, they should have it. However, it is also the fact that there are many students who spare too much time and donÅft study hard. We must know that it costs more than we are paid for our own work to have a lecture. So I think that they need to think more seriously about how to use time including studying, working, playing and so on.   " 
"I agree with this statement because I think that to have a part-time job is precious experience. If we had a part-time job, we could experiment rule of society and difficulty of earning money.   As an other reason, college students need much money. For example, some students live alone, so they cost much money at lighting, heating, food, water expenses and rent and so on. Therefore it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  When I high school student, I had experimented three kind of part-time job. As an end of first grade, I began a part-time job. It was a restaurant. Sadly, I quitted this job only three months because of the trouble about relation of owner.  Next spring vacation, I had had a part-time job. It is a arrangement of the good in the shed. It was also short time job.  From next May, I had worked at Tounichisuisan which manage distribution. Hourly wage was 850 yen. It was a rare case for high school students. Because it is general case for high school students that hourly wage is about 750 yen. I had worked there about ten months.  I learned many things through these experiments. It is important for working to communicate well at work. Working is very hard over my expectation. I realized that money and time is so important. " 
"I think that part time job is not important but not bad for college student. It is most important thing for college student to study hard. Student's parents pay much money to college. Student can earn only about 2000 yen per an hour from part time job at the most but parents pay about 3000 yen to college. So student should not skip them class to part time job. But college student is not child. They need more money than parents provide them. For example they want to play with friends, buy books, cloths, games and etc. If they have perfect free time, I think that they can work on part time job. Of course, the part time job should not be too hard to study on next day class. They can not only earn money but also can get some good things from part time jobs. For instance, they can communicate with people out of college. College students hardly talk with people out of college. And they must not be angry with customer to earn money. So part time job make them more patient. The tim e of part time job give them things that they can not learn from college." 
"I agree with the statement that is important for college students to have a part-time job. I think that it has 3 factors. First, earning money by doing part-time jobs helps their family budget. Generally speaking, each studentÅfs family budget consists of his or her parent or parents income. Increasing family budget by doing part-time job means that increase available money. In many cases, first year student will take a great deal of money. For example, play with new friends or members of the club which he or she is belonging to make deep friendship. Especially the student who is living at an apartment house will take higher money than the former. Second, I think that main purpose of a part-time job is not only earning money but also to get chance of meeting another sex person. This is serious problem for students of the engineering faculty. For example, our English oral class consists of only men! It has no women. Because of this pessimistic situation, we should do part-time job to break down this situation and to have girlfriend. Finally, social experience maybe the most important factor. Wide view and unique imagination are essential things for engineer or any other job. To get them we have not only to learn but also to get through real. ThatÅfs why I think this thema is important.  " 
"I agree with this statement, because I think to have a part-time job is good experiences and Japanese college students have a lot of spare time. First, through working, we are able to learn a lot of things and get some skills. Sometimes we have some troubles, but we are able to solve if we try to as possible as we can. These experiences will help us in the future for example it will be good weapons in job hunting. These experiences may also help us find new interests. It is said that todayÅfs Japanese college students are not able to find things which they want to do in the future so they may find that things if they do a part-time job. Second, in Japan it is said that college students have less lessons than junior high school students and high school students and have much more vacations, so they have a lot of spare time. It is chance to do a part-time job and earn much money. Then during the vacation, they are able to go a lot of places with their friends. I think t hat the time when people are able to do a lot of things in the life is when we are college students. Then I think that college students should experience many new things through working. " 
"I agree that college students have a part-time job. First reason, it is good for employers. College students have much advantage to be employed. They have more free time than others. They have strong power and high intelligence. And, they have strong eagerness which they want to get a job. They are great working power, which they have high potential ability. And, part-time job is low cost relatively. Many companies want low price working power such as part-time worker. It is good thing that many college students contribute working power to society. Second reason, it is good for college students economically. Many college students need much money for various reasons. If they work part-time job, they get wages in short time. It is natural that college students begin a part-time job. Third reason, it is good for college students to experience works. College students are located in front of adults. Part-time jobs get for them to experiences of works. If they have experiences of part-time job before they get a normal job, they can get the job smoother than without them. It gets advantage for college students to get the job. They are why I agree that college students have a part-time job.   " 
"   It is important for collage students to have a part-time job.  I think if collage students do want to study major subjects they shouldn Åft have a part-time job. That is because if they learn collageÅfs study perfectly, they can not have time to have a part time job. But I think some students can manage to do the two things. Probably, such students will not be blamed, and they will spend their collage life with a sense of fulfillment. A lot of collage students live alone. So they must make ends meet with money which their parents give them. I think such students must have a part-time job to lessen their parents Åf burden. By doing that their parents will be glad.  And some students have a part-time job to merely gain money to play.(perhaps it applies to me.) But the purpose most of collage students in Japan have a part-time job is it. They often say that American students have a part-time job to gain school expenses, and Japanese parents spoil their children too much. Exactly I think so. I neither agree nor disagree with collage students have a part-time job, but I want them to use the money which they earn by working not only themselves but also their parents.   " 
"I agree with this statement. There are three reasons why I think it is important.   First of all, through a part time job we can experience and learn many things which we can not in our school life. When we graduate the college and get a job, the experiences is very important.   Second, we can really learn the importance of money. Almost all of us have lived using money which our parents had earned. We might take it granted that we have money and can use it. We know getting money is very difficult. However we donÅft know how difficult it is in real sense. We can not learn the difficulty until we have a part time job. When we experience the difficulty, we know the importance of money for the first time, and we begin to thank our parents.   Third, college students have many free times. Of course studying is the most important section of students. However, I realized the fact; even if, we study very hard, we have more free times than when we were high school students. Now, I donÅft have any part time jobs. When the classes are end, I donÅft have what to do, and go karaoke, boring or so on. As the result money disappears from my wallet. If I have a part time job, I get money and I donÅft have any times to use money. It is just like killing two birds with one stone. " 
" I think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job.I think there are two reasons for this opinion.First,all college students need money.Some studnts earn it to save money,some need it to live themselves,and so on.I think it is very important for men to save money because they need money when they get married and it is generally man that pay wedding money in Japan.And college sudents have to go school with their own clothes.I think almost students wore a school uniform when they are high school student,so they wore same clothes every day,that is a school uniform,and they must not be troubled with clothes.But now they have to wear different clothes every day,ofcource some people may same clothes,so they earn money to buy clothes.People who belong a club need it to buy the club goods.College books are high cost,so we need money to buy it. > Second,we can learn social rules and common sence to have a part-time job.This is a thing that we canÅft learn through college.I think all people should experience part-time job at least one,so I want to have it early because I have never experienced it. > These are my opinions. " 
"I agree with this statement because having a part-time job will be good experience for college students. I think we can meet people who are various generations. Doing so, we can get a sense of values which we did not have till then. For example, they are manners and common sense.  I think also we can experience various jobs. Besides, we get a skill and knowledge such as cooking, carrying, register, and so on. Some restaurants or bars give meals for a person who has a part-time job there. It is grateful for college students who are particularly living themselves.  If we work and earn money ourselves, we learn the importance of money. It also becomes economical help. Besides, if there were enough money, we can spend more money on our favorite things. It changes our sense of money when we received money from our parents. The new sense of money makes us not to spend money wastefully. We can use money by our intention and responsibility.  I think it is the last chance that we have a part-time job when we are college students. We can get the ability that we live ourselves before we go into the society. It is useful when we go into the society.     " 
"I agree with this opinion. You may say that college students should study hard so that they  can play active in society,but it is not correct.   I support this opinion with three opinions. First of all, they are able to make many friend s. There are the younger generation and the middle generation and the older generation in wo rkplace. Students may learn many things from working or communicationing or spending with mi ddle or older genaration who live longer than them. Second, they learn the importance of mon ey. You may understand that, we realize the importance of thing or how hard it is when we ex perience it. In my experience, when I started to work a part time that I earn 800 yen per an  hour, I can't buy things  which cost me over 800 yen easily.Third, my last opinion, they ca n earn money. How to use it is vaviey, for example,school fee,money for food,money for club  activity,and others.One of these is money for travel abroad,now I save my money for this.I h ave been abroad for only once.It happened when I was three and hardly remmember.But,accordin g to friends,teachers,and books,it is so great. when college students look at many things in  abroad countries,they look at things with new eyes. Conclusingly,college students should work for a part time job and earn money,of course.I thi nk that these experience may help them in their future.(" 
"I agree with this subject. Many students work part-time in order to enjoy school life. Enjoyment differs from student to student. That is playing with friends or getting to a license or saving or paying for oneÅfs hobby. But some student can not get credit because they work part-time. They lose sight of original purpose. Some parent opposes this subject because of this. Money that student earn in school life is little. When students become a member of society, they earn same money soon. So they should pay money that they earn soon. Money to pay in school life is difficult from money to pay in society life.   I know student who pay school fee. KOBE University is public university, but this school fee is never cheap. This price is seven hundred thousand by year. For students, this price is very high price. So he always works part-time. When I think him, I think     students who can spend school life without working is rich. Some students need not work, but some students need work. Some students are rich, some students are poverty.   Because in university students have various circumstances, I think students work part-time without losing credit should be permitted " 
I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  They can know importance of money and joy of earning money by themselves. If they are given money by parents or other people, they can't know these things.  And they can experience many things, which can't be experienced in the college life, in a part-time job. For example, they learn manner as worker or service for customer, work with adults, teach a child what they have ever been taught in school, and so on.  These things are very important to work in the society in the future.  I have taught math to a high school student in a few days in summer vacation of this year. It was difficult but very good experience to teach anything to a person who doesn't know it, and to think how to say to be understood what I want to tell. However, I don't think that college students have to do a part-time job. Study is more important than a part-time job for them. If a part-time job stops a college student from studying, he mustn't do a part-time job. And college students shouldn't do a part-time job at night.
I agree to this opinion. Because having a part-time job teaches college students important things. First, we can know worth of money. In fact, I think that it is difficult to get money by having a part-time job. When I was a high school student, I spent money given by my parents. But then, I didnÅft know worth of money, because I didnÅft have a part-time job!    Second, we can know social manners. In my case, I became polite, because my part-time job is service job in a restaurant. But, I canÅft learn many social manners in college. So, having service jobs teach us how to contact with other people. I think that this experience will be useful for me after I graduate this college.    Third, we can get skills. In my case, I can get cooking skills. These skills are very useful for me living alone. We will be able to get various skills by experiencing many part-time jobs.     By these reasons, I think that it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. But we have not to forget that we are college students, and we have to attend classes in college and study hard.  
I think that college students should have a part time job as they can, because they  can decrease their parentsÅf burdens by earning money for their selves and  it is good for them to do so.  Generally, college students have a lot of free times and they should spend the  times effectively. Moreover, they enjoy free times or holidays by the money they  earned.   However, it may said that it have some bad aspects for college students to have  a part time job. One of them is that the times for studying is decreased by the   part time job, but I don't think that a college student who have a part time job can't  study enough. That reason is that we are able to learn manners and greeting through  a part time job. Certainly, studying is one of the most important things for college  students ,but it is one of the most important thing to have some experiences to work in  society too. For living in the future, we need to work and earn money, so we had better than to be accustomed to work early as possible.  Now I don't have any part time job, and I want to have, if there wasn't any examination   and I could have many free times.  
I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  One reason is that college students need money to play or have meals with their friends. For college students, to be with their friends is very precious. So, in order to enjoy college life, they need to have a part-time job and earn money. The other reason is that they should get use to working before they graduate from college. I think society is severe and really different from college. If we donÅft work hard, we may lose our jobs. When we work, we have a lot of chances to work with people who are in different posts from us. In order to do well with them, we need experiences.  I have a part-time job and I realize that it is difficult to earn money and that working is not interesting. Many students have a part-time job two or three days per a week. I think that is good because we should get use to society gradually.  I have a friend who works in a restaurant. She works until a.m. two or three oÅfclock. So she is often late for the class. I think she is wrong. We students should think of studying first. When we go out in to the world, we can work midnight many times but we canÅft have time to study. So, in my opinion, we should have a part-time job which doesnÅft have effect on our college life.           
I think that it is important for college students to have a part time job. But I think that it is not good for high school students to have a part time job. I think that high school students have a lot of things to study. For example, English, math, history, Japanese, and so on. High school students have to take a college entrance exam. I think that college students have more important things than a part time job. I think that high school student are little younger for having a part time job. On the other hand, I think that college students have more free times high school students have. I think that a college student can learn a lot of important things about our society. For example, human relationship, true value of money, hardships of getting money, and so on. I am male, so I have a part time job just now. I have a part time job now. In a part time job, I do a lot of mistakes. But I think that these experience should become important things in my future. But I think that the most important thing for a college student and a high school student is studying.       
I think that to have a part-time job for college students is valuable.  I never worked as a part-time job since I entered Kobe University.  I began a part-time job at Hokkahokatei 5 months ago, I worked very hard.  I learned a lot of things there , for example, greetings. I have never known  that when I enter working place I should say ÅgOhayougozaimasuÅh.  And I learned communications are very important , I had a lot of trouble  for the first time because learning a work was hard and I didnÅft familiar  there worker. But I came to work smoothly for 2 months because   I got well with them. I had a lot of communication them, so ,  I got used to work. And another thing which I learned is that  earning money is very hard. If I work 3 for a week , I can earn about   40000 yen for a month. Of course it is very hard. But, I want a lot of  things ,clothes, shoes, games, bags, wallet, big sofa bed and so on.  And I need money for food and association, for example, karaoke, boring  ,tennis clubÅc  I Åem running short of money every day ,so , I have to work.  But I think that too working is a waste of times because I think that  while campus life we can do anything which we want to do. 
I think that a part-time job is very important and precious in our college life. Because we don`t know the society very well. Doing a part-time job can tell us the society. And we can acquire common sense. If we didn`t have a part-time job, we wouldn`t get it. And not doing a part-time job is lost much money. Actually, I didn`t have a part-time job in summer vacation. Then I was playing with my friends every day and night. So, I was lost much money. What other thing of a part-time job is that our human relations spread widely. If human relations spread widely, we would be able to enjoy our life. Indeed, we may be restricted our free time, but we can get much better things. And by doing a part-time job, we can help our parents. Our parents send me rent and living costs every month. I think that I want to earn my living costs by myself. In the future, I must be going to earn my living costs and family`s. From now, if we don`t know the difficulty of earning, we would have trouble surely. So, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. 
I think it important for college students to have a part-time job. There are four reasons. First, to have a part-time job is helpful to know the society. Most of the college students donÅft work. So they donÅft know the way to live in the real world, for example how to earn money, how to act manner, and how to communicate with the unknown people. These skills are very important. Second, to have a part-time job is helpful to know how hard to earn money. Probably, they lead the comfortable life because they get the money from their parents. Generally, such life doesnÅft teach them how important money is. But they have a part-time job, they got money from themselves. So they can understand how hard to earn money. Third, they can predict the roughly future. For example, a college student has apart-time job in one company. So he would know the mechanism to run the company and to earn profits. Moreover, he could see old men whose he in the future may be alike. So he can predict the future and know the futureÅfs trouble concretely. The final, they can get great confidence. It is true that to have a part-time job, because their main aim is to study in college. But they achieve it, so they can get confidence that is helpful for leading life. By these reasons, I think it important for college students to have a part-time job.
 In the case of this question, apart from issue which we need money or not , I think that it is not the most important for us to have a part-time job. Bu t I am sure that in college life it might be important to do in some degree. E ven if we need so great money, money is especially and useful to live. Therefo re, there is no reason for not having a part-time job. In other opinions, to h ave a part-time job is practical for our experience of life. Surely, it is imp ortant to have a part-time job in order to experience a society. But, I think  that in college we should make effort to learn various things. If anything, I  would like to have general knowledge and expert skill through my college life,  since I entered the department of applied chemistry in Technology. To be hone st, it is now so difficult for me that the special knowledge of technology is  very wide, deep and complicated. Therefore, I think that it is more important  to learn hard, than earn money, for my sake of work as a scientist in future.  Of course, I profess myself to fond of earning much money.  
I agree with the statement. But I have a term to have a part-time job.  The term is that college students have to have reasons to have a part-time job. We students have much time we can use freely. In my opinion, students should do what they can do only now. For example, we can study what we like, we have dream and go ahead the dream. However, when we graduate from college and start to work, we will be limited by work. So time we can use will be little. It is not until I started to have a part-time job that I realized that how important time is.  But, some students must have a part-time job to make money. For example, getting a car license. I think that college students have to make money by themselves.  Moreover there are some students who use their time in vain. Such students should have a part-time job and they will realize importance of their time.  In this way, we are different from our reasons to work. We are now college students. So I think that we must decide whether we should work or not. In this opinion, I agree with the statement. But if students try to work, they must have certain reasons to work. 
I agree this opinion. This is because I think that we should have some social experiences while we are students. In my case, I teach various subjects to junior high school or high school students, so I can come to get along with in good means.  I can not only get along with them, but also have experiences to talk to their parents. In other words, I can ÅeÅfencounterÅfÅf various social circumstances. Moreover, by having a part-time job, we can recognize the importance of money. And, in my case, I came to have a responsibility to money; for example, the way to use money, to think to money, etc. But, the most important thing is to understand the border between study and my life ----part-time job or playing.  As we are college students, it is not until we precede study that we should have a part-time job.  When we became college students, we tend to neglect study. But, university is not a place to play, but to study and actually we have studied hard to learn many new scholarships at university. I agree that we have a part-time job after understanding the ÅeÅfpolicyÅfÅf of students.        
I think part-time job is very important for college students. I have mainly two reasons to support the idea. First, we need money to enjoy college life, but it is no good to rely on our  parents. College students are enough to earn money at least for playing. I  belong to wind orchestra club, and I need about 1 million yen in 4 years, fo r dinner with our juniors, maintenance of music instruments and so on! I donÅf t want to ask my parents to help me. Second, part-time job is good experience for people who work as employees in the future. I work in a convenience store now. When I began to work there, I was often by owner because I was so nervous that I made a lot of mistakes. However, now I got used to the job and became able to do what I have to do as fast as possible. I met many people and learned a lot from them. For example, I learned pleasure of communication with guests and a sense of responsibility. Perhaps people who have never done part-time job have large troubles when they find employment in the future. Therefore, I think college students should do part time jobs to raise themselves. 
I agree with the statement. Of course, college students must study hard. However, I think a part-time job has some advantages. I will show you advantages.   First of all, I think it is not good that college students completely depend on parents for money that is used by playing, because almost college students are more than 20 years old. They are adult, so they should prepare for independence. So they should try to play by only using money that they earn by a part-time job. There is advantage that college students can independent.    Second, a part-time job makes you notice the importance of money. When I did not have a part-time job, I usually waste money on buying unimportant things. However, I have a part-time job now, I cannot waste money. When I go shopping, I think carefully the goods which I want to buy are really necessary. And I get to save money for future. There is advantage that not only you notice the importance of money but also you can find new use for money.    Finally, you can meet many people at workplace. For example the boss, senior, company, customers and so on. When you talk the boss, you must be polite. When you talk to customers, you must answer with polite words. There is advantage that you always be able to be polite unconsciously. On the other hand, when you talk to company, you may find new of life. You may be able to find good friends who you cannot meet at college. There is advantage that you can broaden your horizons.    So I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  
I disagree with that it is important for college students to have a part-time job, because I think studying is the most important thing for college students. I donÅft think to have a part-time job is bad, because I think earning money by ourselves during college students is good experience ,besides we can make friends with person who go to other school or who is another age. However, I think if we cannot study so much because of their part-time job, we should not have a part-time job. The thing which we have to do during college students is studying. We have to work every day after we graduate college, even if we donÅft want to work. So I think that we donÅft have to work during college students. Of course, we donÅft have enough money if we donÅft have a part-time job, so we may want to work and get money. Then I think we may work for a few days in a week. However, if we graduate college and begin working at the company, we will not have enough time to use for ourselves, but during college students, we have enough time to play with our friends or to use our hobby. I think there are many things we can do only during college students. I think we should use our time for ourselves and enjoy our college life. Therefore, I think a part-time job is not important thing for college students. 
In my case, I have to work part-time. I mainly work at a supermarket, and also work as a tutorial and cram school teacher.  Why do I work so much? This is because IÅfm a so-called working student. If I didnÅft work, I couldnÅft go to university, buy something I want, and even eat lunch. Therefore, for me, working is important. However, for rich people, part-time job is not important. Part-time job means that we exchange our precious time for cheap pay. Some people say that it is important for us to work part-time when we are students, for social study. You might have been taught like that. Do you really think that if we worked part-time job, we could know one of the most important thing of our life? I want to insist that such a thing is a lie. I think we should spend times significantly. For example, to participate in the volunteer, enjoy club activities, or study what we really want. These activities really make us experience good thing. There are a lot of thing that can be done when we are only student. Unlike those activities, we can work at any times in our long life. In other words, when we become independent, we have to work all our life. So, I am opposite to working part-time when we are student.  
I agree to the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. We can learn importance to work and to have responsibility from a part-time job. It is just like a practice of a true job. It is hard to start a true job without a practice. Not only we are able to get money, but we can make new friends at workplace. We might be able to find a new way to think about our lifestyle, get new skills and become good at expressing ourselves.   However, now my parents say that having a part-time job robbed me of a time to study, so they are unwilling that I start a part-time job. And I really have never had a part-time job yet. So I canÅft talk about a part-time job so well. Of course it is important for college students to study. But I think it is worth to do even if it shortens a time to study. I canÅft keep up with talks of my friends about a part-time job now. And I am sorry for my parents and my friends who do a part-time job hard. I would like to start a part-time job as soon as I can. 
 I donÅft think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.   It is because I know that those who like smoking feel stress if they are told not to smoking, and to smoke after dinner seems to make them happy and calm very much. I think that both smokers and nonsmokers should enjoy dinner. I hate smoke of tobacco.  When I go to a restaurant with my friends, we usually choose nonsmoking seats. If I smell of tobacco, I lose the want of eating a little. Therefore, I wish all the restaurants completely separate smoking seats from nonsmoking seats, and prevent smoke of tobacco from leaking out of smoking seats. By it, everyone can use restaurants comfortably.  However, I have a problem when I go to a restaurant that allows every seat smoking with my friends who like smoking. When I enter it, I manage to stand the smell. I can afford to chat with them. However, as they start to smoke in front of me, I hardly stand it.Å@It is too unpleasant for me to eat, but I sometimes canÅft ask them to stop it. Therefore, honestly, I wish all the restaurants to ban it. 
I donÅft agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan, because those are the place where customers enjoy not only eating but also having a conversation and atmosphere. If the guests only do eat some hood there, smoking should be controlled. But people come to the restaurant in order to relaxing and enjoying by having meals. Imagine it when you are prohibited from wanting to do----now you want to be smoking in this case-----,though you expected. I know many of smokers want to have a smoke after the meal. Please think that it is similar feeling to after the meal coffee in the person who has not smoked. Setting you have to take meals quickly aside, it is very boorish thing when you are deprived of the enjoyment of after the meal.  And I do not say that I want to take smoking in everywhere. Only I am unpleasant in all seat no smoking. So, in restaurant, I think that it is good to divide the smoker seat and stop smoking seat. In not only smoking problems but also every thing, I think that it is good not to exclude only one side not to recommend only one side. People think about themselves and feel things in various ways, so I oppose the opinion that smoking should be perfectly forbidden at all the restaurants.  
I agree with this topic that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan. There are two reasons why I think so.  First, smoking is bad for our health, especially lung. Smoking is known as the major cause of lung cancer. Smoking also causes many heart or bronchus diseases. If all the restaurants in Japan would prohibit smoking, the number of smokers, or the number of smoking times might be decreasing, I think.  Second, some of the nonsmoker spaces are insignificant. Many restaurants in Japan have nonsmoking space. But actually, sometimes smoke from tobacco comes to nonsmoking space from smoking space. It is very bad for nonsmoker because most of they are not like smoking smell. IÅfm nonsmoker, and I hate smoking smoke too. And generally speaking, it is more danger around smokers who have a smoke than smoker themselves. So they hate tobaccos smoke, all the more they are eating.  However, for smokers, it is stressful that they cannot smoke, and maybe it is bad for their health. But smokers should stop smoking even if they are eating. So IÅfm in favor of this topic. I wish it would come true some day, and other public institution should be banned too, I think.  
I agree with this idea. Simply, it is one of grounds that I don't like smoking, but I think there are two reasons why smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. First, smoking is harmful for you. For example, if you habitually smoke, you can get a cancer of the lungs easy. And you can get nicotinism, too. By nicotinism, you can be taken tobacco dependence, so you are not able to stop smoking gradually. Because smoking affects your health step by step, smoking should be perfectly forbidden not only restaurants but also daily life. Second, smoking bothers those around smoker about passive smoking. For instance, passive smoking is harmful for those around smoker, too. It increases by passive smoking that Possibility that you can get diseases such as cancer even if you do not smoke. The trouble is not that much. There are people who dislike smoke of tobacco. I do not like this smell, too. Especially, I am having dinner. This smoke spoils good meals and good times. So smoking should be cut out at all restaurants.   I can not smoke because my past disease. I hope that smoker aware that there are people who are harmed by smoking such as me. 
I definitely agree with this following idea ÅfÅfSmoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in JapanÅfÅf On the country I have the opinion ÅeÅfSmoking should be completely banned in the all public places.ÅfÅf I have some reasons why I think so. First of all, smoking is very harmful to the health. For example, it is a leading cause of lung cancer. Smoking has a bad influence not only on smokers but also on passive smokers. And the influence on passive smokers is more harmful than the one on smokers. There are many kinds of people who come the restaurant; family, students, old people and perhaps the people who have the allergy to tobacco. If there is only one man who smokes, all people are forced to breathe the smoke of tobacco.  Secondly, seeing someone smoking and smell of tobacco lose our appetite completely. We go to restaurant to eat and enjoy delicious foods. Smoking in restaurant spoils such thing. For the people who dislike tobacco itself, to take a glance at someone smoking loses their appetite. And smell of tobacco spoils foodÅfs good smell that stimulates their appetite. And I think smoking at the table is very rude for the cook at the restaurant. For smoking makes the sense of taste.  Thirdly, restaurant is the public place. In the public place there are many kinds of people. Some people dislike tobacco. I think the all thing that trouble other people should be banned in public place. For these reasons, I agree with the thinking ÅeÅfSmoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan.ÅfÅf And I think smoking should be banned in other places. 
I donÅft think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Actually, in many public place smoking is banned. Especially I donÅft think that they should smoke at the street over walking. But I think they may smoke at the restaurant. Some friends of mine smoke, and they say that smoking can get rid of stress for them. At the restaurant I have a part-time job the guests can smoke at all seats. When I see them smoking during job, it seems that they take a rest by smoking.    But, the other hand, some guests hate smoking. I am often inquired if there is a non-smoking room. Some of them give up entering my restaurant because of we have no non-smoking room. I donÅft smoke, so I also can understand their thinking that smoking does harm.   As a result, I think that there should be two spaces at the restaurant: smoking room and non-smoking room. Then both smoker and non-smoker will be able to enjoy eating and talking at the restaurant. And I think they can spend comfortable at the restaurant. At not only restaurant but also other places it is important for them to understand their thinking each other. Then I think they can live more comfortable. 
I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan for three reasons.  First, as you know, smoking is bad for your health. Even if you like smoking, you ought to reduce smoking. The law against smoking will be a chance for you to stop smoking during meals.  Second, many people have dishes in restaurants. Though some of them may like smoking too, but others donÅft like it. You may say that these days more and more restaurants separate between smoking seats and no smoking ones. But smoke widen throughout the floor. Moreover, you can do harm much heavily in case children are there. Both physically and mentally, children are more effective than adults. It may inhibit them from growing! And of course you canÅft easily make up for it. You will get many responsibilities by smoking in public. Third, smoking prevents you from tasting dishes. ItÅfs a pity that even though good chefs give you delicious plates, you wouldnÅft be able to feel anything special. ItÅfs also rude for the chefs.  In the ends, by smoking you have a fun only for a second, and after that you will get many problems. I hear that many countries in the world have already banned smoking in public. They widely announce that smoking is a cause of many diseases. In Japan there are less strict against smoking now. But weather strict exist or not, you should stop smoking such places like restaurants where many people are. 
 I agree with this statement. I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I have mainly two reasons and, then, I will mention why I agree.  First, a lot of people who do not smoke often hate a smoke of cigarettes. At the restaurants, they have the rights of enjoying eating, and if someone is smoking near them they can not enjoy it. Since the restaurants are public place, it should be kept comfortable for everyone. Smoking sometimes makes people uncomfortable, so smoking should be banned at the public place like the restaurants.  Second, a smoke of cigarettes affects not only the feelings of people who do not like smoking but also the health of everyone. If you smoke, of course it is bad for your health. In addition, it is worse for the health of people who sitting near you or serving the dishes to you. It is proved scientifically that people not who smoking but who is near smoking man are more affected in the point of the health. So smoking should be banned in order to protect the customers and the employees of that restaurant from harm of the cigaretteÅfs smoke.  That is my ideas about smoking. Of course it is better that they can stop smoking by themselves at the restaurants but it is difficult, I think. So smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. The restaurants should be comfortable place for everyone.  
I agree with this idea of ÅgSmoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in JapanÅh. There are three reasons I think. First,Å@tobaccos do harm to people by the smoke. There are many poisonous substances and very bad smell in the smoke. People who don't smoke feel ill and can't eat deliciously. Nonsmoking people eat at a restaurant for the same money that smoking people pay. But if they can't eat deliciously because of the smoke, it is not able to forgive. Second, though the restaurants have smoking area and nonsmoking area now, they are divided the one room so the division of smoking or nonsmoking doesn't mean. The two areas connect each other so the smoke can go through the area. I don't know why the restaurants permit it. Third, smoking at the table is bad manner. Around the table people must feel ill eating delicious dishes by the terrible smoke. And people who smoke tobacco are likely to be looked proud. Other people also feel that tobacco is bad thing. Those three reasons make me agree with the idea of Ågsmoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in JapanÅh.   
I think that smoking should not be banned at all restaurants in Japan. Of course, a lot of studies show that smoking is harmful not only for smokers, but also the people around smokers. Smoking causes the lung cancer; it almost becomes a commonsense.  However, many smokers continue to smoking although they know the commonsense. A study shows that otherwise once a person is used to smoking, it is difficult that he gives up smoking, smoking help smokers concentrate on their works, or make smokers feel relax. These effects make it more difficult for smokers to give it up.  Restaurants are the places where people feel comfortable and relax through the dishes. If smoking is banned at all restaurants, those who make it a rule to smoke a cigarette after eating will feel uncomfortable. The owners who manage restraints should not make them feel such uncomfortable feelings and they will not. This is why I insist that smoking should not be banned at restaurants. On the other side, it is also important that those who donÅft smoke should not feel uncomfortable because of smokers. The owners should make effort as well as they can. If it becomes true, more people have more comfortable and better times. 
From the beginning, I firmly object to smoking. Smoking do harm to you. For example, it lessen your strength, it has carcinogenicity, It makes you liable to be hard to recover from sickness, and so on. The above facts are very famous. But some young people, especially teenagers, donÅft know the above facts. Of course a lot of young people know the above facts. But even these people also donÅft know the real terror of smoking. In a word, they make light of smoking. Some people begin to smoke with a slight interest. Then they come to be prone to be addicted to tobacco. Finally they canÅft refrain from smoking. I think that the most serious terror of smoking is secondhand smoking. If you donÅft smoke but you have the person who smokes around you, you suffer the harm of tobacco. And to our surprise, the smoke does more harm to the person who doesnÅft smoke than to the person who smokes. Then there are a lot of restaurant that doesnÅft have no smoking seat or no smoking area. In my opinion, such restaurants should set up no smoking seats or no smoking area. Frankly speaking, I think that the statement ÅgSmoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant. In Japan.Åh is an excessive enforcement.  
I agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. There are three reasons why smoking should be prohibited.  First, smoking is bad for our health. Smoke contains some harmful substances and they often cause cancer. It does harm not only to a smoker himself but also to people who are around him and never smoke because of him. So smoking is not good at all.  Second, smoke has very bad smell. It gives pain to people who are around a smoker and do not smoke. At restaurants there are little children as well as adults, who dislike smoke.  Lastly, at restaurants there are many families, lovers, friends, and so on. If someone starts smoking at such place, they will feel badly and their happy time will be soiled. Only one smoker sometimes brings discomfort to everyone there.  So I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. In addition, I hope that tobacco completely vanished all over the world. If so, I can live more comfortably and happily every day!! 
I donÅft agree with that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Today, in Japan, you may often see signs ÅgNo smokingÅh at many places. For example, you can find that at offices, colleges and stations. It is sure that smoking is bad for our health, not only smoker but also nonsmoker. But I think these days movements against smoking go too far. In this topic, it just solve by separating smoking people from no-smoking people.  From the beginning, a restaurant is space to relax. Although smoking harm oneÅfs health, smoking relax smoker. So I think we should think not prohibit smoker from smoking but how separate smoker from nonsmoker. Too interfering with people who have different thought is not good for our society. It is better that we find the way to live together in same place. So I think this topic is very trivial. It needs just a little device. The equipment that separate people who smoke from people who donÅft smoke become the solution, I think. So we have not need to think Ågall or nothingÅh.  From these reason, I donÅft agree with smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. 
I agree with this idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. There are three reasons why smoking should be forbidden. The first reason is that the smell of smoking can disturb the flavors of dishes. Foods may taste down by that of smoking. The second reason is that family customers can come to restaurants. I think that parents want to prevent their children from smoke. Smoke is too much harmful for what children grow up. So, in front of children, people should not smoke. I think that the last reason is the most important reason. The last reason is smoking does damage to not only the smoking people but also the other people around the smoking people. Surely, there are the spaces which are prohibited smoking at almost all the restaurants in Japan. But the smoke flow widely around the restaurants. There are many people in the restaurants. So, at common place, smoking should be banned. Therefore, I agree with this idea. But I also think that this idea is sorry for the people who like smoking. It seems that they want to smoke after eating. So, I think that restaurant managers had better than to make a space for smoking out of store.
I agree the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  There are three reasons why I think smoking should be completely controlled.  First, smoking is very harmful for smoking people themselves. Smoking people have high risks of disease such as lung cancer, larynx cancer. If pregnant mother smokes, her baby smokes, too. Then, the baby get same risk.  Second, smoking also does harm to non-smoking people. We call this problem Ågpassive smokingÅh. Even if we donÅft smoke (and hate smoking), we are snuffing smoke coming from tobacco. Smoking people smoke through filters, but other people inhale directly. Passive smoking has a risk to the health of the people who have been troubled with asthma. I am suffering from asthma, so I wonÅft inhale smoke of tobacco in the restaurants.  Third, smoking during the meal is rude for cooks of the restaurant. Long time habits of smoking take away smokersÅf normal taste. Cooks want guests to eat their great dishes deliciously, but they will be disappointed if guests smoke during the dinner.  Many smokers (like my father) canÅft stop smoking despite their will. So, I think society should deprive them of their smoking opportunity. 
Many people like a cigarette ,and smoke at any place in japan. if only we are over twenty years old, we can buy it in any store easily. Today, while  a lot of them feel relaxed by smoking it,, many people who don't smoke suffer from that smoke.    The fact is that smoke contains harmful material which cause the person lung cancer . So, to reduce the risk for the smoker, a cigarette is  with a filter tip. But only being by the person who is smoking , even if you are nonsmoker, you smoke passively. Passive smoking is more risky for the human health than direct smoking.      But ,today, we have done many things to change this circumstance into that both smoker and nonsmoker get along without feeling uncomfortable. we have separated smoking area from non smoking area. At the restaurant ,office, university, even at the platform , smoking  space is established. Owing to that ,we have not only succeed in reducing passive smoking ,but also many smoker are able to have a chance to reflect on their smoking manner. A lot of thing for smoker and nonsmoker have been complemented, nevetheless now should smoking be banned completely at all the restaurants ?  
I disagree with the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at the restaurants in Japan. The reason to disagree with it is that it is too severe. I do not smoke and dislike smoking. Smoking is very bad for the health of smoking people and people around smoking people. Also smoking costs highly. In restaurants, smoking makes delicious foods bad. I think smoking has no merit. But people who want to smoke exist. For such people, I think areas where people can smoke should be placed. That smoking place is not left makes smoking people stressful. If drinking is completely banned like the same reason, I canÅft stand it. But I want to say about smoking. Though I think smoking places should be kept, some smoking people smoke in the place where people must not smoke. I donÅft excuse it. Some people dislike smoking very much and anther people may become sick for it. Smoking people must keep the rules and have good manners of smoking. If they completely do that, I think smoking does not have to ban. Smoking itself is legal and for people to smoke is free. As long as people donÅft trouble the other when they do something, everyone doesnÅft have a right to ban it. 
I donÅft agree the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in Japan. Surely, nonsmokers have rights that they avoid breathing cigarette smoke. It is because that nonsmokers damage their health by passive smoking. However, most restaurants have divided into the no smoking seat and the smoking seat. So, nonsmokers should sit the no smoking seat, and some restaurants have the functions except meal. For example, Ågfamily restaurantÅh have function of chatting, rendezvous, resource, studying and etc. Such time, the cigarette is indispensable for smokers. Therefore, I think that the smoking seat is necessary in some restaurants. However, I think that many restaurants could not be done separation of smoking areas. For example, the cigarette smoke flows to us even if we sit on the no smoking seat. This example is an imperfect separation of smoking areas. So, I donÅft agree the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant, but I think that it should improve the method of the separation of smoking areas. For example, the structure of the restaurant should be designed to take cigarette smoke into account. The area in the smoking seat is divided with the wall. Finally, this is an opinion from the smoker.
  I agree this theme. Smoking is harmful not only for smokerÅfs health but for nonsmokerÅfs health. Because, nonsmokers expose to passive smoking. Tobacco contains harmful substances such as nicotine. It is possible for smokers and nonsmokers to cause lung cancer.  Passive smoking has a risk of lung cancer. In Japan, when we go into the restaurant, we are asked if we smoke or not. If we say yes, we will be led to smoking seats. If we say no, we will be led to nonsmoking seats.  In a restaurant, although the seats are parted, nonsmokers can smell the smoke. And many families eat at restaurant. Of course they contain children. Smoking has a bad influence on children. Children are very sensitive and easy to be effected by smoking. Many people donÅft like the smell of tobacco. The smell of tobacco is very unpleasant for nonsmokers. If smokers want to smoke in the restaurant, they should smoke outside the restaurant. For example, I have a part-time job at a restaurant. It bans smoking all day. We ask customers not to smoke. So, I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  
I donÅft agree with this statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Because this statement is too severe to follow. In fact, it is clear that smoking is one of the most causes to lead to cancer. And smoking gives bad influence to not only their own but also around people. I think this is the worst point of smoking. And I need not ban smoking completely. I think that the restaurants should divide into smoking people and not smoking people. GREEN MOS BURGER is a good example. In there, smoking seats are placed outside the shop and non-smoking seats are placed inside the shop. This is very interesting. Few years ago, in there, smoking seats were placed inside the shop. This is cared about this problem. Now at the many restaurants, smoking seats and non-smoking seats are divided inside the shop. I am satisfied with this situation. But the restaurants that are banned smoking are increasing. So if I think about the matter in terms of management, it is good to build the restaurants for smoking people. These are the reasons why I donÅft agree the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
I donÅft smoke but I donÅft hate smoking. But I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I have three reasons for it. Firstly, the men who dislike smoking are unpleasant. Smoke will flow to non smoking area if there are smoking seats and non smoking seats in the restaurants. After all, troubling people is bad. Secondly, smoking do harm to people who donÅft smoke. It is good to injure smoker itself but not good to harm non smoker. And passive smoking is possible to get cancer people who are around smoker. Especially, for babies this is a big problem because smoke influence development of babies. Smoker shouldnÅft smoke in spite of obstructing development of babies. Thirdly, smoke is dirty. Smoke dirty food and the atmosphere at the restaurant and produce unpleasant smell. Restaurants are the places at which people enjoy eating food and talking. Smoking is opposite for this. ItÅfs a pity that smoke dirty dish which cook make hard.  Thus smoking trouble many people. It is not bad to smoke. But smoker should smoke after they think people who around them and place.  
Recently, in Japan many people got to know the risk and unnecessariness of smoking in society. Thus, I think it is necessary to ban from smoking at all the restaurants in Japan. There are three reasons why I think so. Firstly, smell of dishes-sweet smell, sour smell and so on- is very important in restaurants. And the cigarette spoils a smell of the cooking. It is true that there is some person who wants to smoke while  eating a dish or drinking liquor, but the smoking should be prohibited at the restaurant if we think about many other people. Secondly, the smoke of the cigarette may spoil equipment: for example, wallpaper or ornament in the restaurant. It is very wasteful if these things are very precious valuable things. Thirdly, the prohibition of smoking is a flow of the modern society. It becomes natural on a train and the platform. Or there are many places that you cannot smoke in the workplace. So it is thought that it is a matter of course to prohibit smoking at a restaurant. In conclusion, the smoking should be banned in all Japanese restaurants 
I think it is very good that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. There are some reasons so that I think so.  The first reason is because I donÅft like the cigarette. I dislike the smoke of the cigarette which other people smoke, and of course I donÅft smoke. So, I donÅft want to be disturbed the meal at the restaurant by the smoke of the cigarette of other people. The second reason is because the cigarette has a bad influence on a body. Smoking cause the diseases such as the lung cancer, if it is terrible, there can be the mortal thing to smoker. In addition, the harm of the cigarette extends to not only the smoking person himself but also the person of the circumference. By passive smoking, the family of the smoker is easy to come to suffer from diseases such as lung cancer, too.  The last reason is because even if we separate smoking seats from non-smoking seats, I think that we cannot intercept smoke completely. The eating people will feel unpleasantly when smoke comes. As conclusion, from these reasons, I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. 
 I agree this idea. Many restaurants already make non-smoking area. So I think itÅfs easy because we only need one more step to ban smoking completely. IÅfll show you 3 reasons to support my opinions.      First reason is health. As you know, smoking causes many diseases for example lung cancer. And it is said that if you smoke one cigarette, your life span will shorten in 50 seconds. I think dangerous risk is so openly said so smoking people must stop it and be careful of their health.      Second reason is passive smoking. Even if you want not to smoke, you would breathe smoke because of the one smoker. This is dangerous not only adult but also children especially baby. They canÅft escape from smoke by themselves. So parents should avoid smoking. And passive smoking canÅft prevent by family only. We need all social peopleÅfs cooperation. So, smoking should be banned at all social place, of course including restaurant.      Third reason is smells. Have you ever been to KARAOKE? DonÅft you feel uncomfortable by smell of cigarette? I have experienced that situation many times. Cigarette is annoying product. The existence itself is troublesome.      For those reasons, I think all restaurants should ban smoking completely. 
I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Roughly, I have two reasons to agree with this proposal.  First of all, those who smoke are minority. These days, the population of smoking is decreasing gradually. In fact, according to JT, 10 years ago, 56.1% of Japanese men smoked. But, in 2005, only 45.8% of Japanese men smoke. So, no smoking is the trend of these days. We should not ignore this chance. In addition, the rate of Japanese women smoke is only 13.8%. Simply, only 30% of Japanese people smoke. It is not wise, not efficient to satisfy only 30% of people, and to dissatisfy 70% of people. It is so crazy! So, we need not think about the minority ? those who smoke. We should think about Ågthe greatest happiness of the greatest numbersÅh(Jeremy Bentham).  Secondly, the smoke of tobaccos makes people who donÅft smoke feel unhappy. At least, in Japan, eating is regarded as the part of the culture. Eating is the part of our happiness. So, eating is very important, cultural, and holy. But, smoking destroys it. Smoke destroys the perfume, and the taste of meals. No, not only the meals, but also they destroy the culture of eating! So, as it were, smoke is the destroyer. It can call smoke as offender. I canÅft put up with it! So, I want to expel smoke from restaurants!  
In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.    The first reason is that people should have meals at restaurants. I do not agree with smoking at restaurants. What are restaurants for? Everyone go to restaurants to eat, not to smoke. If someone wants to smoke, he or she should not go to restaurants. And smoking would weaken the sense of taste. Anyone donÅft want to weaken their sense of taste.   The second reason is that when smoking is completely banned at restaurants the smoke may come to non-smoking sheets. Smoking is completely banned at some restaurants but there are smoking sheets and non-smoking sheets at most of restaurants in Japan. I think this is not good. I insist that restaurants should remove all smoking sheets.  And the third reason is that smoking is harmful for everyoneÅfs health at all. Drinking alcohol has some good points but smoking does not have even one good point. Moreover, smoking is harmful for other people who donÅft smoke. It is important to think about other people. If smoke disappear from Japan, everyoneÅfs health could be better in Japan. Because of These three reasons, I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  
I agree with the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Tobacco damages the health of people who smoke and donÅft smoke. When there are people who smoke in the same room, people who donÅft smoke feel bad and cough. People who smoke will feel so comfortable when they smoke. But tobacco trouble people who donÅft smoke and they feel so bad.  Restaurants and coffee shops are areas where we take a rest. So, people who donÅft smoke visit there in order to take a rest. But there are people who are smoking in a same room, people who donÅft smoke canÅft feel comfortable.  I think that people who want to smoke should smoke outside and in the areas which are allowed to smoke. I think that it is a minimum manner.  Tobacco gives not only harm to peopleÅfs health, but also bad smell caused by smoke. Because of the bad smell, most people who donÅft smoke feel bad. And the bad smell remains for a long time. The bad smell cling to our hairs, clothes, and bodies.   So, I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants and coffee shops in Japan. 
I disagree with an opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I have two reasons for this.  Firstly, recently in Japan, most restaurants have both of smoking seat and nonsmoking seat. You are asked which seat you like when you come into restaurants. So if you do not smoke or dislike smoke, you can choice nonsmoking seat. I think that it is not necessary to be banned smoking at all restaurants.  Secondly, we often hear that people who smoke love to have a smoke after eating. So they maybe want to have a smoke after they eat in restaurants. Only if there are both of smoking seat and nonsmoking seat, I think that they may smoke after eating.  Many people think that smoking is harmful for their health. Actually, smoking is said that it is worse than useless. And then, clouds of smoke by people who smoke give harm to people who do not smoke. But people who have smoked heavily for a long time depend on cigarette heavily and can not stop smoking immediately. I think that you may smoke unless you keep the manner and do not have trouble anyone. So I disagree with an opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. 
 I donÅft agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants at all. This is not because I am a smoker. In fact, I donÅft smoke at all and hate smoking. Then, there are some reasons why I think so.   These days, it is very often said that smoking is not good for our health and smoking tend to get a cancer. However, many people smoke in spite of the advice. In addition, there is an opinion that when nonsmokers breathe the smoke of cigarette, nonsmokers tend to get a cancer more than smoker tend to do.   Only because of these reasons, it is too one-sided to adapt smoker to nonsmoker. In restaurants, if they ban smoking in all areas, people who want to smoke canÅft smoke and if they put up with smoking, they canÅft enjoy themselves and maybe they feel bad.    I think that it is good to make the partition wall or the partition room that separate smokers from nonsmokers. When we do it, it isnÅft one-sided and it is a fair solution, I think. In restaurants these days, some make such things and shop assistants ask us whether we smoke or not or which seats we sit down. So, it is nice to be complete.    Therefore, there is no necessity to be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  
I certainly agree to the idea of ÅgSmoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.Åh It is because it has now been a worldwide approach of increasing and spreading non-smoking areas.      First of all, just like many other western countries are concerned of, Japan is also increasing non-smoking areas throughout Japan. Public buildings had first taken its action in various governmental offices and into social facilities. And now it has gradually but surely spread into private facilities like theaters, big and small shops, restaurants and companies. It seems that people had finally become to think about the non-smokers. It has even been taken into transportations like buses, taxis, trains and planes.      Secondly, we have to be aware that restaurants are the most sociable places where various people get together. Their customers consist of children to elderly adults. Therefore, it is obvious that smoking is not good for them. Moreover we also have to be aware that people eat at the restaurants. Smoking would certainly destroy the flavor of food and drinks.      Finally, I would have to say that smoking is not good for oneÅfs health. Cigarette smoke is now considered to be harmful to non-smokers as well as smokers. Therefore, to think of others, it is fair enough for smokers to smoke in smoking permitted places. As a result, more and more non-smokers want a smoke-free environment. And in the future, as I feel a little sorry for the smokers, but they would soon have an even harder time finding places to smoke. 
 I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan, for there are the four following reasons. Firstly, I hate smoking because I have smoked myself sick and while I was walking downtown recently, the man in front of me tapped his cigarette, and almost made a hole in my clothes. Secondly, if people are in the room filled with thick, people are exposed to secondhand smoke. This is dangerous to us, because secondhand smoke is deadly poison. So the person should not smoke at the restaurants. Thirdly, when many of people look at smoker at the restaurant, the cheerful mood is broken by the smoker. We go home with our disappointed look. And the restaurant managers are at a loss, as visitor does not spend much money eating and drinking in the restaurant owing to the smoker. As the result, the smokers may lead the restaurant to bankruptcy. Lastly, when people smoke in the restaurants, there is the heap of cigarette ashes at the restaurants. The garbage is thrown away by employees. This means that the restaurant managers must pay extra cash to employees. The managers canÅft put up with the spending. According to four problems, I am opposite to smoking at the restaurants in Japan. ThatÅfs all. Thank you for your reading.  
I think smoking should not be banned at all the restaurants in Japan. There are three reasons which make I think so.  Fist , there is a surely fact that many people want to smoke. If smoking is banned at all restaurants , many place where they can smoke reduce. We, who do not smoke, hate smoke which is produced by tobacco, and be happy if smoking is banned. But I feel this action ignored their thought. We have to think about people who want to have comfortable time to smoke. Second I think banning smoking is not necessary. Why reason I think so is that if the restaurant separates its space , for example one is for people who smoke and another is for people who do not smoke ,it is not needful action to ban smoking. Finally if smoking is banned at all restaurants, some restaurants are against it. Because these restaurants gather people to take them place for smoking. Then they have to other way to gather customers. I think these three statements is connected. To see these reasons linked, I think smoking should not be banned at all the restaurants in Japan. 
I  think  smoking  should  be  completely  banned  at  the  restaurant  in  Japan .  There  are  three  reasons  why  I  can  agree  with  the  ban  on  smoking .      First , smoking  in  restaurant  does  harm  to  non  smoker . It  is  called  passive  smoking .  Its  harm  is  as  dangerous  as  risk  smoker  has .  and  in  public  place ,  restaurant  non smoker  think  unpleasant.    Second,  smoking  disturb  that  we  enjoy  the  dinner  taste .  even  nonsmoker  around  smoker .  and  it  is  rudeness  to  chef  in  the  restaurant .  Because,  every  chef  must  be  in  earnest  to  please  guest .    Third,  every  restaurants  have  original  mood .  for  example, bright, adult, clean  etc. It  relate  the  restaurant,s  image  . But, smoking  destroy  the  mood  and  image . The  reputation  of  restaurant  go  bad.  Therefore  the  profit  will  be  diminished  .  I  may  overstate , however  the  restaurant  allow  smoker  to  smoke  may  go  bankrupt .    I  explain  three  reasons.  And  I  think  smoking  affect  nonsmoker  and  the  restaurant .  So ,  every  restaurant  should    completely   ban  smoking .   Also  I  think  smoking  area  also  should  be  removed.  Smoking  smell  hang  over  even  no smoking  area .  Limited  smoking  area  is  only  nonsense.  Finally,  smoking  should  be  banned  not  only  restaurant  but  also  other  public  place.  For  example, school  park  road  etc . Smoker  should  find  other  method  of  relaxing  and  entertainment.   
I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. It is painful for the people who smoke to be completely banned from smoking at all the restaurants. But, frankly speaking, I donÅft like cigarettes. I think that many people donÅft like cigarettes too. When my mother smokes, I become angry and say her to stop smoking or go away. Thus, in the restaurant, some people donÅft feel good, if anyone is smoking. Moreover we have meals in the restaurant. So we may feel much worse.  As a personal opinion, smoking should be completely banned at not only the restaurant, but also all places. I think that smoking gives us no advantage. Instead smoking is bad for our health. Besides I learned that smoking does harm to people around a smoker than the smoker. It is really annoying for nonsmoker. Frankly speaking, I think smoking is the same as a waste of money. In addition, we often see that someone toss away a cigarette stub by the road. For the above reasons, smoking should be completely banned at all places. But, considering smokerÅfs feeling, I want smoking to be banned at least at the all restaurants in Japan.  
I donÅft like smoke. So I think smoking should be completely banned at the all restaurant in Japan. There are some reasons.  First, people who smoke bother other people who donÅft smoke. For example, when I went to the restaurant with my friend, there were some people who smoked. Then, our pleasant dinner was over. We were tired of smoke. And when we got out the restaurant, our clothes smelled bad. I felt bad. Like this, smoking bother people.  Second, smoking is no good for health. I hear that not smoking peopleÅfs lungs are clean, but smoking peopleÅfs lungs are black. Once you begin to smoke, it takes several years to return to healthy lung again. And generally speaking, people who smoke tend to become lung cancer. To make matters worse, not smoking people may become disease by passive smoking. Especially, it is not good for childrenÅfs health. That is to say, smoking is bad for not only smoking people bad also not smoking people.  That is why, smoking is banned at the all restaurant. Smoking people should consider people who hate smoke. I think that all people, from children to old people, enjoy dinner and talking at the restaurant.   
 I donÅft think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. There are two reasons why I canÅft agree with the ban on smoking. First, banning at all the restaurants is too excess. Now, at many public place smoking is banned, for example the station, on the street and so on. And smoking area is increasing. So someone think smoking should be banned at all the restaurants too. But restaurants is eating space, and also resting space. Smokers relax at the restaurants by smoking.  We donÅft have the right to deprive the smokers of their right to smoke.  The other reason is that it is not necessary to ban smoking at all the restaurants. Of course smoking does harm for our health, and even passive smoking also does harm to nonsmokers. So think it is better for smokers and nonsmokers to separate space in the restaurant. Then, nonsmokers can enjoy eating without worrying about passive smoking, and nonsmokers can enjoy smoking at the restaurant without about nonsmokers. In fact, many restaurants have smoking table and nonsmoking table. And I think it is good enough for smokers and nonsmokers to enjoy eating at restaurant.  By these reasons, I donÅft think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in japan. 
I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  There are two reasons. First I think so that is personal reason. That is I hate smoking, tobaccoÅfs smell and that smoke. I come to feel sick just to smell the tobacco. And the restaurant is the place that to eat lunch and dinner. When I eat a meal I want to be relaxed. But there are smokers same place I canÅft be relaxed. There will be the person who thinks so. So I hate smoking. Second tobaccoÅfs smoke do harm to non-smoker. Passive smoking is worse non-smoker. And it is cause lung cancer. So People who take care of health become unhealthy because tobaccoÅfs smoke.  But smokers may say that they have freedom to smoke. That is surely right. I think, however, they donÅft have the right that may trouble another person. And they donÅft have the right to hurt the health of another person. In other words they should mind another person. And I think that when smokers want to smoke at a restaurant they go to outside a restaurant and smoke there.  For there reasons, I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. 
I agree with the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at the restaurants in Japan.  There are three reasons why I agree with the ban on smoking.  First, smoking does harm smokerÅfs health. So, smokers become to dislike exercising and they are apt to be illness. For example, smoking do harm smokerÅfs lung. And the function of lung becomes not to work normally. They sometimes die of lung cancer.  Second, smoking does harm not only smokers but also non-smokers. In fact, Passive smoking is sometimes more harmful than smoking. I think that it doesnÅft pay for non-smoker. But some smokers stupidly smoke regardless of the presence of the non-smokers. Now many people and pets worry about to the danger of the passive smoking. So smoking makes no benefit to all creatures!  Lastly, people recently think that smoking is a kind of shameful act in formal or public place. I have even heard that smokers canÅft promote in a certain big corporation. In fact, non-smoking areas are increasing now. For instance, there are completely non-smoking areas in platforms, coffee shop and beach. In America, smoking is completely banned at almost all the restaurant. Therefore, I think that smoking should be completely banned at the restaurants in Japan. I think that it is the most important thing to feel of others for smoking.  
 I agree with the statement. In public areas, I think, people should not be admitted to smoke.  Until the time I spent at Kobe University for a few months, I thought that the only thing to do was to separate smoking areas from non-smoking areas. Then people who did not smoke could avoid othersÅf smoking. But I was noticed it was not true. Let me talk about places outside restaurants for preparation for the main topic.  I have seen many Kobe University students smoking at corridors and exteriors. I have also seen people smoking at stations or the places more than three meters from the smoking areas. They are non-smoking areas. I think people who love smoking cannot will to bear non-smoking situations.  In restaurants, the main topic here, the matters even more vary. Restaurants are small domains but interiors. There, people on non-smoking seats will not smoke because they are extremely controlled by other peopleÅfs eyes. But, smoke caused at admitted seats more or less goes to non-smoking seats. Also, non-smokers often sit on admitted seats in crowded restaurants.  The only way they protect people from smoking is to ban it in public domains, of course with laws. Certainly punishing hard is not always the best way. Crimes by boys and girls seem not to be reducing despite increasing hard punishes. But smoking is not the same with killing a person. Feelings toward killing could sometimes become unbearable, but feelings toward smoking will not if there is punish.  There are many people who hate the smell of othersÅf smoking. Smoking is also harmful for the health of people around smokers. The number of smokers, especially of young ones, is decreasing from year to year. It is time to increase non-smoking areas greatly, and ban all smoking inside the areas. 
I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. There are three reasons why I think smoking should be so.  First, I donÅft smoking and donÅft like smoking. My father doesnÅft smoking, too because he was hospitalized with a disease ten years ago. He stops smoking to be careful about health. Some my friends are smoking but I think they stop smoking with me.Particularly, when we have lunch together, I think so, too. Second, Smoking is very smoky and bad sell. Some people that are not smoking feel unpleasant when some people are smoking in the same restaurants. In such a situation some people that come to the restaurant to have good dish can not have good dish. Third, Smoking gives not only a smoking person but also the person whom there is around bad influence in them body. Now smoking is banned at many public places, train and bus because passive smoking is known as the cause of lung cancer.  I think that some people that are not smoking do not want to go to the restaurants that there are some smoking people and a parent having the child does not want to go there.        
I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. There are two reasons for my opinion.  First, smoking is harmful not only for smokerÅfs health but also non-smokerÅfs health. Many people move in the restaurants every day, of course both smokers and non-smokers. It is unlucky for non-smokers to absorb smoke at the restaurants. Smoking at the restaurants is inconvenient for non-smokers. If staffs of the restaurants and smokers recognize that smoking at the restaurants is harmful for non-smokers, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  Second, smoking could ruin smokersÅf sense of taste. Smokers move in the restaurants to eat delicious food, but they canÅft eat them in the best condition. Cooks must want their customers to have their works in the best condition, but they canÅft.  If cooks really want their customers to have their works delicious, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  I donÅft like tobacco very much. For non-smokers, smokers and cooks I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Smoking cannot help anyone, I think. The all restaurants should be the place where everyone enjoys eating delicious food, I think. 
I donÅft think smoking is bad. But I am really angry with smoking in the street.  It is very dangerous. In fact fire of a tobacco took my hand and I got burned. My friend has got burned too.   It is more dangerous for children. Because the height of an adult personÅfs hand is the height of a childÅfs head, it is possible for a child to get burned his or her head.   It is also a problem that many people throw away their tobacco.  In particular cities, it is banned to smoking in the street. I agree with it. 
I think smoking should be banned at all restaurants in Japan.  Smoking has good points and also bad points. Of course, you can get a pleasure, and have a relax when you smoke. I donÅft know how I feel when I smoke, because I donÅft smoke. However, at the same time, you get harm your lung and people next to you. When a non-smoker breath smoke, he get harm more seriously than smoker breath smoke. You damage other people unconsciously. If you are in your house, you can smoke without any anxiety. But if you are in a restaurant, you should not have a smoke because there are many people around you.  Someone may say it is a pity for smokers that smoking is banned at all restaurants in Japan.  Of course, today, smoking is banned at many places. For example, you must not smoke at many stations, department stores, buildings. If all restaurants become banned places for smoking, smokers canÅft get a pleasure by smoking in Japan. However, you should not harm other people by smoking. If someone dead because you smoke, how you take the responsibility of his death?  Therefore smokers should go out from a restaurant if you want to smoke, or find other ways how get a pleasure.   
I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. When I say more, walk smoking should be banned everywhere. There are some reasons for my opinion.  First, smoking harms not only smokerÅfs health but also non-smokerÅfs health. I have heard secondhand smoking is worse than smoking. In other words, it is to say that the person who does not smoke is easy to suffer from cancer. Why non-smokers are harmed by smoker? If smoker want to smoke anyway, smoker should smoke alone. I donÅft think smoker trouble non-smoker.  Second, there are people who donÅft like smoking smell. Cigarettes smell unique. So, there are people who are made feeling bad. Third, I think the quantity that smoker smokes will decrease by enduring to smoke after meal. A smoking rate is 50 percent at present in Japan, and smokers are pointed the badness of their manner. For example, there are walk smoking and littering cigarette. These destroy environmental. If the quantity that smoker smokes decrease and number of smoker, the quantity that walk smoker and littered cigarettes may decrease. Problem of prohibition of smoking is difficult to solve. But this problem should be solved little by little for people and environmental. 
If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan, the restaurants may not give enough service to customers. So I am against it.   It is true that smoking is harmful not only to the health of smoker but also to the health anyone around smoker. So if someone wants to smoke, he or she should smoke in the area separated from non-smokers. Actually there are many restaurants do the separation of space or times for non-smokers. Almost smokers are satisfied with that. But if smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants, many smokers canÅft be satisfied. Smokers canÅft enjoy a coffee and a meal without smoking. They may not think they quit habit of smoking to go to restaurants.  Sempai of my universityÅfs club, she is studying abroad in Canada, said in NYÅfs restaurants smoker are complained. In New York smoking is already banned at all restaurants. So when someone at restaurant wants to smoke, he or she has to go out to smoke. This disturbs talking. So She said banning smoking at restaurants is not good. I also think so.   I disagree with complete banning, but I think there needs compromise between smoker and non-smoker. So I agree that smoking is completely banned at the restaurants where donÅft give separation of space or times for non-smokers.            
I donÅft think that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. I have two reasons why I think so. First, a lot of people hate to smoke or its smell. Especially in a restaurant, people have a meal. So smoking will disturb other peopleÅfs meal. However smoking will disturb a lot of peopleÅfs meal, I donÅft think that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. The problem can solve easily. To make a space which is separated perfectly other space for non-smoker. Thanks to this space, non-smoker will have a meal with good mood.  Second, smoking is very bad for his health. His lung becomes black by cigaretteÅfs tar. But, smoking is not only bad points. For example smoking is good when I have nothing to do, I smoke and spent time with good mood. Moreover, when I am nervous, smoking will cool down me.  Today, campaign against smoking is expanding gradually in Japan. But I can often see smokerÅfs bad manner about smoking. For example, throw a cigarette butt out on the street, smoking in non-smoking area, and so on. Smoker should have a good manner about smoking, and get along with non-smoker. So, smoking should not be completely banned. 
I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Now I will show some reasons. Firstly smoking does harm to people. So if you continue to smoke, it will be all the cost of your health. And even people who donÅft smoke are harmed by smoking. For example, smoking may cause lung cancer, respiratory diseases, arteriosclerosis, and so on. And there are many families at restaurants. Because smoking can harm to children, all the more smoking should be banned at restaurants.    Secondly if you smoke at restaurants, people around you cannot eat foods deliciously. This is because smoke can damage taste of foods. For example, you cannot smoke at Starbucks at all. Starbucks take care of flavor of coffee. It is important to keep taste of foods and drink. Finally smoking is banned at all the restaurants in some countries. For example, the US, the UK, Italy, Australia, Canada and so on. In these countries, if you smoked at restaurants, you are punished for smoking. And other countries are also going forward with banning smoking at restaurants. Like this, there is tendency which smoking should be banned at restaurants in the world. So Japan also should ban smoking at restaurants. 
Å@I disagree with this opinion for the following reasons.     First, smokers cannot live well without smoking. If smoking is completely banned at the all restaurants in Japan, smokers who are in the restaurants donÅft enjoy dishes and chat with their friends well. They also start to want to smoke and get irritated because they are poisoned by nicotine. Unfortunately, nicotine influences human body very powerfully. So when they do so, you donÅft know what they will do. They may kick the table on which there are a lot of dishes simply because they are irritated. They may hardly criticize a waiter simply because he or she is not good about communicating with them. Smokers who are taken away from cigarettes are too dangerous.       Second, restaurantsÅf sales will fall down. According to research, about one fourth of Japanese people are smoker. It means that if smoking is completely banned at the all restaurants in Japan, restaurantsÅf sales will fall down to three fourth. This must influence restaurantsÅf management. When it is difficult to manage restaurants, a lot of employee will dismiss, and there will be a lot of Japanese people who donÅft have any occupations. It is bad for Japan, and Japanese people.       
    I agree with this statement. We should not smoke at restaurant. There are three reasons that make me think so.     First, smoking is nuisance to around people. They comes restaurant to enjoy their meals, its taste and its smell. However, if there is a smoker by them, their meals are spoiled by smoke of his cigarette. In fact, in the restaurant where I do a part-time job, a woman asked me for  change her table to where is far from the smoker. If I had not changed her table, she would not have been satisfied when she finished her meal.     Second, smoking spoils his own sense of taste. Surely he also comes restaurant to enjoy his meals, its taste and its smell. But, he takes his own pleasure by smoking. He puts taste of cigarette he can enjoy everywhere on special taste of meals he can enjoy in only that restaurant. There is not more wasteful than this story.     Third, smoking obstructs nutrition. As if he ate something healthy, he could not take its nutrition in his body. This is wasteful story too.     Because of above three reasons, I think that we should not smoke at restaurant and smoking should be completely banned at restaurant. 
I think that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  Because, it is harmful for human to smoke. And smoking has many bad points.  First, smoking damages to our health. If you keep smoking in the future, you  will lose your health. Your lung will be a sick. The survey shows that the  cause of lung cancer is smoking. Because smoke contains much nicotine.  Nicotine makes us excited. In addition, nicotine also causes other sick. For  example, heart attack, high blood pressure . . . so on.  Second, smoking makes people who donÅft smoke uncomfortable. When I went to  the restaurant last week, a man was smoking at the next table. The dinner  was very delicious, but smoke made me uncomfortable. In addition, my brother  suffered from cough. We wanted to eat in the more comfortable restaurant. I  think that the restaurant should ban smoking. If smoking will be banned at  all the restaurants in Japan, the restaurants will become cleaner than now.  Because, people who smoke may throw the garbage after smoking on the floor.  When other people see it, they may dislike the restaurant. The restaurant is  damaged by smoking. It is also good for the restaurant to ban smoking.  Recently, many people think that it is important to live in the healthy  life. They are also interested in the sick. So the news about the sick shows  us the danger of smoking. Many doctors appeal that it is danger for human to  smoke in the news. And they appeal that people should stop smoking soon.  Smoking is bad only.   So I think that smoking should be banned at the all restaurants in Japan.  (279 words) 
I think restaurant should not be banned smorking. Many people smoke today,it is banned to smoke in restaurant, restaurant managers will close their restauranrt.  So, I suggest that they should separate smokers and non-smokers. Smoking is uncomfortable for non-somokers,non-smoking irritating smokers. Thus two kinds of people should be separated. 
I think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. There are two reasons for this.   One is that restaurant is essentially not where we smoke but where we eat. I think the people who smoke at restaurants can not understand this perfectly. Indeed, some nonsmokers refuse to eat at the restaurants which are not completely nonsmoking. I do not want to eat at such restaurants, either. Although it is not quite that I can not understand the smokers, who want to smoke in having a rest at places such as restaurant and train, I think all restaurants should be completely nonsmoking from the point of view that more people can eat more comfortably. We are usually at a restaurant for about an hour. I think it is not hard for the people who smoke at restaurants to refrain from smoking for only about an hour.   The other is that the health damage by passive smoking is worried. Passive smoking is that nonsmoker is obliged to breathe the tobacco smoke regardless of or against his or her wish. According to researches, it turned out that the harmful substances in the tobacco smoke which rises from the top of tobacco are much larger in quantity than those in the tobacco smoke which smoker breathe in directly. In short, nonsmoker is in danger when smoker is around nonsmoker. I think the restaurant, where tobacco smoke is hard to diffuse, is particularly dangerous place for nonsmoker.   For two reasons mentioned above, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. I think the Japanese government should legislate against smoking at all restaurants as soon as possible.  
I agree the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.     I think that we enjoy not only taste of food but also a smell of food between meals at the restaurants. A smell of food is important for meals.  Smoking give bad influence on other people.  When other customer are smoking, non-smoke customer can not appreciate a smell of food because of passive smoke in the air. Non-smoke customer may feel that even the taste of food is different. Besides, it is possible that passive smoke in the air made us lose our appetite. I also have experience like this at the restaurants. Moreover, passive smoking is harmful for our health than active smoking.  Passive smoke in the air makes a mess of meals at the restaurants.     I think that it is not necessary for smoker to smoke at meals. If smoker want to smoke at meals, they should go outside the restaurants and smoke to their heartÅfs content. All customers have the right to appreciate meals at the restaurants. I think that we should take this right into account.     For that reason, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.     
I think that smoking shouldnÅft be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Someone may disagree to me because smoking is bad not only for the smoker but also for other people. But, if all owners of restaurants in Japan banned to smoke, smokers would feel very sad. Indeed, I also hate the smell of smoke, yet we cannot ignore the right of smokers.  I sometimes go to restaurant with my friends or family. Then, we are often asked  by the staff whether there is smoker in us. This means that the restaurant has smoking area and non-smoking area. It is good system because two rights are thought about. What two rights mean are the right of smoking and the one to get clean air.   Recently, smoking is banned at too many places. For example, itÅfs banned in parks, on streets or even at restaurants. Probably, smokers want to go to restaurant. But itÅfs hard for them to stop smoking. So, restaurants should have two areas, which is smoking area and non-smoking area.  Good society is the one that all the people (of course include smokers) can live comfortably. So, smoking should be allowed at some areas in restaurants. 
I don't agree to this statement. I don't like smoking, but this statement is  too extreme.  I have never smoked before, and perhaps I won't smoke in the future. Because  smoking is bad for the health, and modern society is against smokers. As a mat ter of fact, the people who try to stop smoking and have already stopped smoki ng are increasing.  However, the most reason why I don't like smoking is that I hate the flavor o f smoke. It is simple reason. But when I breathe smoke, I cannot stop coughing .   I mentioned disadvantage of smoking, but I don't think smoking should be comp letely banned at all restaurant in Japan.  Most restaurants in Japan have smok ing area and nonsmoking area. I think it is good system. I have never felt bad  in Japanese restaurant because of smokers. It is impractical to ban smoking a t all restaurants. I think smokers should not be limited still more.   Today, smoking is banned at many place in Japan, and more and more smoking ar eas are disappearing. It is pleasure for the people who don't like smoking. I  am also one of the people who think so. However, I think we have to consider s mokers as well as nonsmokers. I hope smokers and nonsmokers are satisfied at r estaurant.(213word) 
I think that smoking can be harm. So, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. When I go to a restaurant, I almost choice no-smoking seat. But if there is near to smoking seat, sometimes I feel tobacco smoke. And I become sad, because I dislike tobacco smoke.   The environment of place to eat has a great influence on our appetite and feelings. One of important point is smell containing tobacco smoke. Cigarette has not only the smell but also smoke coming into our mouth and eyes. One don`t care cigar smoke, but another might be damaged by the secondhand smoke. According to circumstances, the customer having asthma or allergy may come in restaurant. And a pregnant woman or a small children might sit down in the space being smoke.   Certainly, smoker have feeling to want to puff at a cigar. But I think that no-smoking people`s sufferings of smoke are bigger than smoker`s suppression to smoking. Smoker can smoke in different place and time, for example outside or park or place where there is not people who dislike tobacco smoke.   Now restaurant measure for smoke is not enough. All smoke can`t be absorbed in an air vent. Restaurant is place where many and various people gather to enjoy mealtime and eat good-tasting foods. I don`t understand why we are permitted to smoke in restaurant, while hospital and office have been restricted. I agree to refuse smoking in restaurants as one of solution.   
I agree with this opinion. Tobacco is worse than useless. Tobacco have two bad reasons. Firstly, smoke is an unpleasant smell to nonsmokers. Especially, nonsmokers are displeased with smoke when they eat. Before, I and my mother ate at one of restaurant. This restaurant was very fassionable itarian restaurant. But, this restaurant didn Åft have no smoking seat. We were suffocated by smoke when we ate pasta.  Each foods have smell. People feel foods have good smell. But, smoke is very bad smell. Smoke make nonsmokers lose their appetite. So, smoke not only make nonsmokers displease and cling to cloths and body but also make nonsmokers lose their appetite. Secoundly, smoke is very poisonous. From recent studies, smoke do not only smorkers but also nonsmoker who stay near by smoker. On the countrary, nonsmoker who stay near by smoker rathar than smoker was risked their own life. Commonly, people know that smokers get cancer &#8211;especially lung cancer Å| easier than nonsmokers. But smoke  damaged even people who stay near by smoker.   I think that smoke is free. So, I pity that smoker is limitted place of smoke. But,  smoker can damage other differ from smoker can smoke freely. They should not trouble for other.   
I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. There are two reasons about my opinion.  Firstly, it is bad for us to smoke, though this is not only problem in the restaurants. And smoking does not only harm the smokers, but also harm the nonsmokers. I think that this is a strange story. Smoking not only harms the customers who come to a restaurant but also harms the workers who work on a restaurant. If we work on restaurant from morning till night everyday, the passive smoking will harm our health. ÅgPassive smokingÅh is the act of breathing in smoke from other peopleÅfs cigarettes. The passive smoking more harms our health than the active smoking. So if we make our health care hard, it may be bad for us to work on a restaurant. I think that we should keep our offices clean, when we consider the workerÅfs health.   Secondly, smoking makes the taste of a delicious meal bad. And smoking also spoils a cheerful mood of the meal. We do not come to enjoy at all for this. I had had a hot time with my friends, when I went to a restaurant with friends. But I got out of the restaurant, for I hated next customer to smoke.  Therefore, I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.                       
  I donÅft think so. There are many smokers in Japan. They smoke to relieve stresses and people go to restaurant to eat meal and to relax. In fact, when I go to a cafe, there are often some office workers resting and smoking. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants, they canÅft relieve stresses there, and in addition, they may feel unsatisfied. It is nonsense. There are smoking seats and nonsmoking seats in most restaurants to let nonsmokers and smokers more comfortable. In that case, restaurants should keep the air completely clean for fear of not being complained about smoke by nonsmokers. Å@If smoking is banned at all the restaurants for the purpose of making smokers stop smoking, it seems to be better to ban selling cigarette. There will be little change even if smoking is banned only at the restaurant. Exactly, people may be able to eat meal deliciously by doing that. But smokers go to other place to smoke. For example, they smoke on the street, and people have a trouble of their throwing away cigarette butts. Such a thing will repeat. I think that the most important thing is decreasing the number of smokers gradually rather than keeping out them from restaurants.
I donÅft think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  Now, in Japan, 26.8 percent (man: 41.3 percent, woman: 12.4 percent) people are smoking.  In economical side, if these people do not enter restaurants, restaurants would have a big loss  Some people say that if they do not ban smoking in restaurants, non smokers wouldnÅft enter restaurants.  But restaurants have already restricted smoking.  They set up seats for smokers.  All restaurants do not set up it, but almost major restaurants set up it.  In addition, they set time, when people can smoke or not.  For example, in lunch time (11:00~14:00) all seats (include smoking seats) are banned smoking.  Restaurants concerned guests.  Thus, restaurantÅfs attitude is not to ban smoking.  As long as someone legislates that smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan, restaurants will not ban smoking in restaurants.  Restaurants choose profits.  Restaurants provide a lot of comfy equipments for smokers and non smokers.  I think just a few cheap judgment non smoking people yell ÅeÅfsmoking is too bad!  So smoking and smokers should be exterminated!!ÅfÅf  So I think they canÅft completely ban smoking in restaurants in Japan in economical viewpoint and they donÅft have to ban smoking by force.  Because there are demands.  
Å@I am agreeable in this opinion. There are two reasons.   The first is that I may smoke passively when I sit down near the person who smokes on the seat. Passive smoking is that nonsmokers who are near smokers are forced to breathe the smoke got out of the end of tobacco and expired by smokers. And these smokes contain many harmful substances such as what can cause cancer. Unfortunately because most of the nonsmoking seats were full up, I have been led to a nonsmoking seat near the smoking seats by a clerk before. Though I was eating deliciously, I had my feeling displeased by smoking smell. I think that other people as well as I are also troubled with smoking smell.   The second is that bad smoking smell sticks to clothes when sitting down near smokers. Of course, that also does nonsmokersÅf feeling harm. The other day, when I went to a restaurant with my family, I have had my feeling displeased by smoking smell from my father. Even after we finished eating and went out of the restaurant, I have had my feeling displeased by smoking smell from my clothes again.   From these two reasons, I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. 
I am agreeable in this opinion. I think that I should prohibit not only the restaurant but also the smoking at all public places. The smoking hurts not only the health of the person himself sucking in but also the health of neighboring people because there are two kinds of active smoking and the passive smoking for smoking. Needless to say, the active smoking means that someone smokes. The passive smoking means that I breathe smoke appearing from a cigarette.  If there is a person sucking in near in spite of not wanting to smoke, someone will do passive smoking. In brief, many people are made to do the smoking that they do not hope by active smoking people. In a more terrible thing, passive smoking is worse in health than active smoking.  A passive smoking people are unpleasant and are bad in health, and there is not a good thing at all. Therefore the active voice smoking people should think about surroundings and smoke in oneÅfs house or the smoking space. I sit in the non-smoking seat by all means at the restaurant because I was not able to eat food deliciously owing to the smoke near person who smoked. However, smoke comes to the place that is near to the smoking seat in the non-smoking seat, and it is often that there is no non-smoking seat when it is crowded. So I agree this opinion.   
I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. First, if people eat or drink with smoking, they will feel foods and drinks less delicious than they have a meal without smoking. Second, it is very important reason, smoking gives people so bad effect.  Smoking is the major cause of the lung cancer.  The effect reaches to not only the man who smokes practically but also people who are around the smoker.  To make matters worse, the effect which passive smokers were given is larger than it which active smokers were given.  So stop smoking is healthful for both smoker and people who are around the smoker. I am really afraid of the disease by smoking.  Of course I will never smoke in my lifetime, but I cannot stop other peopleÅfs smoking. The other day, I went to a nearby restaurant with my family.  We sat on no smoking seats.  But then I noticed the smell of smoke.  It is because the smoke flowed from smoking area to no smoking area.  Smoking areaÅfs air and no smoking areaÅfs air were not completely separated!! Thus, if smoking area and no smoking area are separated by the words, it is difficult to separate the air completely. So for the sake of everyoneÅfs nice meals and health, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. 
    I think smoking should be completely banned at all at the restaurant in Japan because I h ave three below the opinion.    First thing is that cigarette has it itself. It is the effect of passive smoking. Passive  smoking injures the people around a smoker without their volition. And passive smoking has  more harmful than active smoking.     Second, now most restaurant separate smoking seat and nonsmoking one. But it cannot separ ate SMOKE. It floats anywhere. Only perfect locked room can do it, however, it doesnÅft real ize in the restaurant in Japan. And more smoking seat often is near the bathroom in the Japa nese restaurant. So many people-baby, child, pregnant woman, and elder- have to pass near th e smoking seat, of course, if they donÅft smoke. I mean, nonsmokers feel so bad because of s mokers. It resemble that the noise of in the train. For example, the loudly talk, the leak o f sound from earphone and the call on the cell phone.     Finally, the climate in Japan is becoming Non-smoking. ÅgI was scared the light of cigare tte.Åh This words is said by small boy and girl on the poster. In Japan now the goverment im poses a duty on cigarettes. And already, smoking seats is excluding from many places.    And first of all,smoking harms the smokers very much...  
I disagree this opinion. There are two reasons. First, although this opinion may be for people who donÅft smoke, most restaurants separate seats for smoking from seats which we must not smoke, so both people who smoke and donÅft smoke can be pleasant now. Second, heavy smokers are able not to go to the restaurants. If the restaurants become to be so, we are able not to go to them together heavy smokers and they will be very angry. I think that we should give them consideration. But, I donÅft speak Åg Smoking is goodÅh I think that it is so bad. There are four reasons. First, it causes smokers to be sick., for example, lung cancer. Second, people around them are also damaged. Third, the environment is worsen because of cutting down many trees to get paper for cigarettes. Fourth, I donÅft like smell of smoke of cigarettes. In short, smokers should smoke on the place on which there are a little people and smoke a few cigarettes in order not to be nuisance to other people, that is to say, all the restaurants in Japan should not ban smoking completely but separate seats for smoking from seats which we must not smoke.
       I donÅft agree with this opinion. I think we donÅft need to ban smoking at all the restaurants in Japan.          First these days almost restaurants have smoking seats and non-smoking seats. I think that this way is very good. Indeed I donÅft smoke and donÅft like tobaccoÅfs smoke. However thanks to separate smoking area and non-smoking area I feel comfortable at the restaurants. Some people may claim that tobaccoÅfs smoke flow to a non-smoking area and smokes are affected their health, what is called passive smoking. Surely passive smoking attacks humanÅfs health. But if smoking is banned at all the restaurants, we cannot escape from passive smoking. Because humans have already polluted the air by tobaccoÅfs smoke. If you completely want not to have passive smoking, you must use a mask always. So we non-smokers should bear to passive smoke.          Second I think we should not blame smokers. ItÅfs because smokers have to pay tobacco tax. In Japan it is important to receive tobacco tax. Tobacco tax is large. Today Japan has a lot of debts. If revenue of tobacco tax gradually decreases, Japanese debts increase and consumption tax rise surely.          Finally I think that we non- smokers need to care about smokers little more. Smoking is the way of refreshing for smokers. If they cannot smoke at the restaurants, they donÅft feel comfortable at the restaurants. Therefore I donÅft agree with this topic.         Thank you.
 I hate smoking very much, so I really agree with the opinion.  First, the reason I hate smoking is that tobacco do many harms and has bad influences on human body. It hasnÅft any merits, and I can find many demerits. Throat particularly tends to be hurt by it. It has very high probability to cause cancer, and some of the heavy smokers killed by it.   Second, if smokers sit in the restaurant, the surrounding people also suffer from their tobacco smokes. In other words, tobacco has bad influences not only on smokers but also on the surrounding people. If there are children in the place, their brains are not developed in particular.  Third, some people say that smoking people is very cool, but in my opinion, it isnÅft cool at all. It is rather dirty, nasty, and badly smells than cool. Though a smoking scene is broadcasted on the TV commercial, people working at the company is very foolish. If someone smokes a lot, their teeth will look like black, brown, or yellow. Their breath will smell bad. As a result, they will be hated by their surrounding people and lose their friends.  Anyway, I hate smoking very much from all the point of view, so I really agree with the opinion that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan.   
I agree with the statement. IÅfm nonsmoker. I dislike other peopleÅfs smoking when I have meals. ThatÅfs because my foods become bad if anyone smoke near me at the restaurant. In such a case, I sometimes feel anger. I want to eat my foods deliciously. Surely it is a suffering for smokers that they must not smoke at the restaurant. But I want them to endure smoking during meals because smokers may enjoy it but nonsmokers feel pain for it. Now, many restaurants divide their room into two rooms, which are smoking room and nonsmoking room. But I think that smokers can put up with smoking during meals because the time they spend having meals is 30~60 minutes and the time is very short. In the first place, the smoking does you no good and much harm. It is useful when you want to get temporary pleasant feelings, but it is absolutely bad for your health. The benzopyrene which is included in cigarettes changes your base sequence of the DNA. It is a terrible material. Smokers should stop smoking. We should quit bad habits. I cannot understand why smokers depend on such a thing. Human beings should not depend on such a things. I think so.  
Now, they say that a cigarret has an bad effect on the smoker's body. Because a cigarret contains a lot of poisonous substances, smokers tends to come down with various illness.  In particular, many of smokers can have cancer  and some of them will die of cancer. What is worse, this affects not only smokers but also nonsmokers who are only around smokers. Those who absorbed smoke which smokers smoked near them can have cancer more easily than smokers who directly smoke. It is true that smoking temporarily makes  smokers pleasant, but after all stop smoking better for both smokers and nonsmokers considering their haelth in the future. When smokers smoke in the restaurant, even if the smoking place is devided into the nonsmoking place, smoke drift near nonsmokers. Therefore nonsmokers are often in dangerous position. If there is a man who take care of his health in the restaurant, a cigarret will cause him much trouble. In addition, due to smell of the cigarret, the smell of the cooking disappoints and the lunch will not delicious. It is  better for smokers to be absorbed in eating lunch forgeting to smoke. In order to enjoy lunch in the restaurant, it is important to stop smoking. 
I have not seen the restaurants which is completely banned from smoking. This is because at everything completely banning is very difficult. Everyone have the right of freedom, so they can do what they think right only when it is not troubling to others.But, smoking makes others smoke indirectly and does big harm. As you know, smoking causes man to get cancer. If the number of smokers is smaller, the fewer people will be died by cancer. In restaurants, many people would not want to smoking indirectly.  By the way, tobacco have a lot of problems. First, smoking causes man to get cancer as I said. Second, throwing tobacco away. Nowadays, trash problem have become biger and biger. When I walk along the street I often see many tobaccos on the road. These tobaccos make the view of town bad and lead fire. Third, walking with smoking. Smoker have the fire. It is very dangerous for other walkers. These problems are my opinions, so there are more problems. If government impose some severe punishment on smokers, the number of smokers would be smaller. I think this is the best idea for small the number of smokers, but this is very difficult to cary out. So I agree to the idea of reduce smoking lounge suchi as restaurants , school and park.  
I agree with this opinion. In a restaurant, those who smoke bother a lot of people very much. A certain happening made me realize it when I was working part-time as a clerk in the restaurant. It is the following.   One day, a family that includes a baby was eating. However, a man sitting next to them started to smoke. Then, the baby began to cry very loudly.   By the way, smoking in a restaurant is a nuisance from the view of hygiene. When I am working part-time as a clerk in the restaurant, I often see that cigarette ash come out from an ashtray and is scattered on the table. Especially in summer, more cigarette ash is scattered by the wind from an air conditioner. Cigarette ash is more likely to get in the dishes.  In the first place, the cheapness of a cigarette in Japan causes the number of smokers in the restaurant to increase. By making the price of a cigarette very high, foreign countries are making an effort to decrease smokers. Japan should also make an effort to do so. Japan introduced the ÅgtaspoÅh system, but it do not mean to decrease smokers. Decreasing all smokers leads smokers in a restaurant to decrease.  
Smoking and breathing the smoke are bad for our health. When someone smokes, people around him breathe the smoke. If it occurred at the restaurant, the smoke would prevent them from enjoying meal because they donÅft feel the smell and the taste very well. Moreover, they may feel uncomfortable.  In case of me, I hate tobacco and the smoke. When my parents smoke during my meal, I feel uncomfortable. I get them not to smoke while I eat meal. At the restaurant, I make it a rule to choice the no smoking area. However, when no smoking area is full, I sit the smoking area unwillingly. Then I canÅft enjoy meal. I go to the restaurant to enjoy meal. I want to eat at home rather than eating meal at the smoking area.  The smoke not only prevent enjoying meal but also is bad for our health. Smoking people donÅft have a right to prevent enjoying meal and influence the other peopleÅfs health. They should consider the environment and people around them. If they did so, they would realize that they should not smoke at the restaurant. If the restaurant banned smoking, people who are like me enjoy meal. So, smoking should be banned at the restaurant.  
It is well-known that smoking doesn't only cause to increase smoker's probability of getting sick but also their surrounding people. Now once sitting at table, we won't leave until finishing meal. In other words, with smokers at restaurants we breathe some smoke all the eating time and take not clean dishes covered with smoke. Smoking allowed at the restaurants forces us to eat dishes polluted with smoke; besides it's about over an hour until our ending to clean on the table in front of. There is a similar situation around us which is as follows: noises on the train, that is to say too high volume music dropped from the earphones. Naturally, on the train people have right to behave freely at some agree. However, do the listeners at too loud volume interfere with otherÅfs right as a passenger? Of course, we say no. Equally, it mustnÅft be allowed that smokers at the restaurants interfere in our enjoying meals. Moreover, there are a plenty of families having at the restaurants. Smoke is especially harmful to children. For our childrenÅfs good health, which in turn for society in the future, smoking at all the public places should be banned soon as possible.   
 First, I know there are many people who donÅft like the smell of  cigarettes. The restaurants where smoking is not banned would be filled with  the smell, so people who donÅft like it would hesitate to inter the  restaurant. Even if they enter the restaurant they would not feel good.  Perhaps they may feel the food is not so delicious, just because the smell  of smoking. It would also be the same at restaurants where smoking were half  banned, because people who sit next to the smoking area, would smell the  unpleasant smell a little. I think people should avoid causing other people  troubles as possible as they can. And it may be very easy to stop smoking  only when you are at table.   The second is that second-hand smoking would cause lung cancer, stomach  cancer and so on. Of course smoking also cause these illness, but  second-hand smoking is more likely to cause them. IsnÅft it strange that  people who like smoking cause other peopleÅfs health to be bad? No one would  be able to take responsibility for other peopleÅfs health. So I believe it  should not be allowed.   In addition, it would also be good for smoking people to ban smoking at  restaurant. They would able to save some cigarettes, not only bad for there  health but also a very expensive substance.   For these reasons I think this idea should be carried out. 
I disagree with this statement. At present, people who are alive longer than 20 years are not forbidden smoking by the law in Japan. So they all have the right to enjoy smoking at will. And of course they also have the right of using the restaurants. If smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants, they cannot genuinely enjoy their own relaxed time - eating, drinking, chatting, and more.   Recently the risk of Åepassive smokingÅf has often come up as a topic that citizens have been interested in. It is surely the important problem for all of the people, especially they who do not smoke or dislike smoking may think about it seriously. But many restaurants already take the provision against this problem: setting up the smoking seat and the non-smoking seat. Setting up both of seats and choosing seat sitting, people either who smoke or do not smoke can spend comfortable time at a restaurant. This provision seems enough to enable all of them to enjoy eating. Banning smoking completely may be too hard for people who like smoking and deprive them of their pleasant.    Smoking people should enjoy smoking with a manner toward other non-smoking people. 
I disagree this statement that smoking is banned at all the restaurants. I have two reasons for this. First, restaurants are where people have dishes with relaxing. All people have right to enjoy eating. Of course, smokers arenÅft exception. They deserve to smoke after eating. Nobody can disturb their leisure. Indeed, smoking harms humanÅfs health. For example, smoking causes lumber cancer, pulmonary emphysema etc. ThatÅfs not all. TobaccoÅfs smoke is poisonous for surrounding people who donÅft smoke. The roomÅfs air is becoming dirty and stink. But these problems are solved if seats are separated for smokers and non-smokers. Smokers understand smokingÅfs damage and select smoking. Non-smokers need not get secondhand smoking. That is, not at all the restaurants but at part of the restaurants, smoking should be banned.  And second, if smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants, the number which smokers go to restaurants will be decreasing. ThatÅfs because they will come to eat where they can smoke, for example, at home or at office. Reduction of customers has a malign influence upon profit of restaurants. Since the food service industry support Japanese economy, Japanese economy will be dealt a heavy blow to and may fall into disorder. In a word, the policy isnÅft good.  Arguments for and against smoking should be decided by each people. Tobaccos are taste for some people. It shouldnÅft be banned unnecessarily. ThatÅfs why I donÅft support the statement.  
Of course we know that restaurants is the place where we enjoy having lunch or dinner. There are no people who eat with smoking. If we have lunch or dinner with smoking, we feel like tasting bad. Maybe we donÅft go to restaurants alone but we go there with someone. In that situation, a person goes to restaurants with someone. If he smokes at the restaurant, probably other people hate it. A man who smokes at restaurants may feel good, but other people donÅft feel good, donÅft enjoy lunch or dinner. Smoking also does harm to weaken-smoking people. If ever a smoking place is separated from non-smoking place, a little smoke made by at smoking place will cover non-smoking place. When the restaurant deal with the smoke, the restaurant must install machines which deal with smoke. The machines cost the restaurant much money. It is not good for the restaurant. So, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. Smoking at the restaurants does harm many people, but non-smoking at the restaurants doesnÅft harm any people. Non-smoking at the restaurants needs for us to enjoy lunch or dinner there. It is important for us to keep manner where we have a lunch or dinner.
I disagree with the statement.  Tobacco's smoke may do harm not only to smokers themselves but also to people who are near the smokers at restaurants. In fact,scientists say that smoke do more harm to people who are near smokers at restaurants than it do harm to the smokers themselves. So,many people may think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants.  But,smokers also have rights to eat lunch at restaurants.Smokers also have rights to eat dinner at restaurants.So,smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants.  On the other hand,from the restaurants' perspective,profit have cut down if smoking was completely banned at all the restaurants.Then,Japanese business also will cut down.It is worst thing. On the meaning of this thing,smoke should not be completely banned at all the restaurants.  The most important problem is that everyone enjoy eating lunch at the restaurants. To achieve the goal,restaurants' staff should divide smokers with no smokers. For example,restaurants'staff should set up big wall between smokers and no smokers.Then,both smokers and no smokers enjoy having lunch. That is to say,smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants.
Today,a lot of developed countrys have started to ban customer from smoking at   Restaurants.The countrysÅf governments have ensured their citzensÅf right to be free from   otherÅfs smok.So why they could do it? One of the reasons is that nonsmokerÅfs insistence-we have the right to be free from otherÅfs smoke-is so strong.They have said ÅgIt is wrong that we,nonsmokers,havedamaged from passive smoking.But in japan,there are more smokers than that of other developed countrys.So first,the governments or city administrations should enforce the low of prohibitting smoking at all restaurants to save nonsmokers from passive smoke.      These days,I often have heard that more and more minor have started to smoke in Japan.That is one of social problems.Some of these children have seen a lot of smoking thing.Say in other words,smoking is so natural thing for them in their life.But in Japan,minorsÅfsmoking is not allowed.To reduce childrenÅfs smoking,to begin with saving them from the surroundings that lots of adults have smoked.If the low of prohibitting smoking at all restaurants is ensured,many children are free from the surroundings at least in restaurant.a lot of children often use restaurants.So that is very effective to save them. 
I agree with this opinion. Nowadays, smoking is banned at a variety of places, for instance, at station, hospital, community center and so on. This means that the number of people who donÅft like smoking is increasing and public opinion heads toward banning smoking. It is very comfortable for people who dislike smoking, including me, because we have not to breathe smoke there. Above all, we dislike breathing smoke while we are eating, for smoke make dishesÅf smell or tastes bad, so we should ban to smoke at the restaurant. In my family, my mother, my sister and I hate tobaccoÅfs smoke, but only my father like smoking very much. Therefore, we made some rules about smoking not to quarrel. First, nobody can smoke at the table and everybody must enjoy eating and talking each other. Thanks to this, we can enjoy our dishes very much. Second, my father can smoke only in his room if he wants to smoke in our house. This keeps our roomsÅf air clear. In these ways, we have some rules that limit smoking and we are in good each other. I think it is very comfortable for us to enjoy our meal without smoking. We should ban it.
I agree this statement. I have three reasons. First, Cigarette is a kind of drug for smoker. It includes ÅgNicotineÅh and this has poison. If you smoke 40,50 cigarettes every day for 20,30 years, you will probably become diseases of lung. So not-smoker should not smoke and smoker should stop smoking as early as they can. In this point of view, this opinion will be useful for smoker to start to stop smoking and to send a healthy life. Second, Smoking is not healthy for surrounding person too. This is because the smoke which smoker blow out has strong poison. A restaurant is the place where a lot of people are, and some smoker comes there with his family. So smokers should not smoke there for  the others and their family in order not to bless the smoke. Certainly, there is an argument that separating smoker and not-smoker solves this problem, but it is almost impossible to separate them completely. People who are around border can be made to keep blessing the smoke. Finally, because recently people who understand an effect of cigarette and stop smoking are increasing, this idea is not ideal. It may be achieved sooner than you expect.  
Many restaurants separate nonsmoking and smoking seats recently. But they mostly are divided a room in two without a wall; non-smokers must share the same air with smokers. If a man takes a smoke after eating, though he is blissful moment, other customers who start to eat are displeased by smell of cigarette. While the smell from the dish is very appetizing, that from the cigarette takes away their appetite. Especially customers are eating at the seats next to smoking become sickening. For cook, it is pleasure that people eat with relish.    And in restaurant many families come to eat. So inevitably, there are a bunch of children. In terms of education and health, it is wrong that people smoke in the places that gather children. Smoke of cigarette contains nicotine and tar. As they cause a cancer, parents should keep a child off it.   By the opinion above, at all restaurants in which various people eat should be completely banned. 
Nowadays, the seats have separated for smokers and for non-smokers in most of the restaurant. However it may be meaningless, because tobaccoÅfs smoke expands around the restaurant. It makes non-smokers feel too bad. We go to restaurant for enjoying          but if there are a few people smoking while miles, the pleasure of eating will be decrease.     Not only uncomfortable, tobacco is bad for health. For instance, people smoking well are more likely lung cancer than non-smokers. In addition, the tobacco does harm not only smokers but also non-smokers as a passive smoking. In fact, many people who donÅft smoke but whose friends or family often smoke die of diseases relating with tobacco. This is a very big problem!        Thus, tobacco has a lot of bat thing; bad feeling, many kinds of diseases and early death or so. I cannot say to stop smoking all over the world, but at least, in restaurant where people enjoy eating delicious foods, it should be completely banned. If smoking is forbidden in restaurant, a lot of people who hate tobaccoÅfs smell will be able to more enjoy eating out. The morals of smoking must be protected by smokers more strictly. We all have the right to eat comfortably, without tobaccoÅfs smoke.      
 It is free whether smoke or not.  But, in fact, not smoker fed up smoker.  Therefore, in restaurants, it is not necessary to ban smoking but necessary to separate space in which they are able to smoke from not space.  Most restaurants in Japan make two spaces, but it is not all.  Smoke from cigarets is worse to our body than directry smoking. Indirectry smoking lead to many deseases.  These are smoker's crime. Smokers have to be careful smoke from cigarets.  And restaurants have to do.  Restaurants have to not only make space in which they are not able to smoke but also set machine rejecting smoke from room.  When other people are eating, smoker near to them smoking is against manner.  It is natural for not smokers to get anger to smoker.  These two groups have to discuss this ploblem.  Smoker most have a moral and protect not smoker's health, and not smoker most protect smoker's right. It is most important thing.  Restaurants help them to do these and have a nice time. 
Every one knows that smoking is bad for our healthy.  A nonsmoker smokes indirectly if people surround him smoke in a small place  as a restaurant.  It is a short time in the passive smoking time for a person comes to the  restaurant as a visitor,  but the waiters of the restaurant must come to work in the smoke of the  cigarette all day.  The prohibition of smoking in the restaurant should be carried out to follow  their health.    Many people think that taste, an appearance and a smell are important for  the best cooking.  When I smell the cigarette, I have a headache. The smell of the cigarette is  never comfortable for nonsmokers.  Some people feel dishes bad if the smell of the cigarette drifts in a  restaurant. It may decline to reputation of the restaurant.  If it is a high-quality restaurant, most of customers do a dress-up and go  to a meal.  We cannot wash the expensive clothes in our houses, so we sent the clothes  to the laundry.  They must bring the smell of cigarettes and feel unpleasant even after  leaving the restaurant.    These problems are to be settled if a smoker endures smoking a cigarette for  dozens of minutes.  t is happy that the prohibition of smoking at the restaurant advances. 
I agree with this statement. Because smoking is the murder as well as the suicide. When one smokes, people around him have greater possibility for cancer and other diseases. Who says it is not the murder? Of course those who do the murder at the restaurants are to be banned. And the penalty for it is very strict. Why smoking is excluded from the murder? In addition to this, smoking is the suicide. The suicide is the murder for oneself. It must be strange to tell the suicide from the murder. These are the same as Åeright Åf war. In the world, right war is impossible because it is nothing but violence. The violence canÅft be right. And smoking canÅft be right, too. That is, the war is direct violence, on the other hand, smoking is ÅeindirectÅfviolence. But according to the custom, these are acceptable. The murder and the suicide at the restaurants could exist. It must be strange. In addition to this, Japan is democratic country. Democracy canÅft go with the violence. And Japan canÅft have any weapons which hurt oneself or others. It is clear that tobacco is a weapon. So we should ban completely smoking at all the restaurants in Japan. 
Restaurants are the places where we enjoy dishesÅf pleasant smell, good flavor, conversation with friend and so on. When someone begin smoking in the restaurant, people surrounded him must be hurt their feelings because the smoke makes the dishesÅf tastes and the atmosphere in the restaurant bad. So the restaurantÅfs customers are not satisfied in dishes. This might be responsible for the restaurantÅfs unpopularity.  In terms of health, the effect of passive smoking on human is grater the that of inhaling smoking. In other words, passive smokers are apt to be taken ills including cancer of the lungs. If someone begin smoking in public space, he do damage to people who surrounded him. Namely, smokers who smoke in a crowded space, they reduce the length of other peopleÅfs life. How guilty it is! Smokers must be considered the place for smoking wherever they are.Recently, there are many restaurants that make smoking sections. But nonsmokers often sit down and eat in the smoking sections if nonsmoking sectionsÅf seat is filled. So if smokers want to smoke, they should be outside the restaurant, or the master of   the restaurant is ought to provide the smoking area for only smokers. If so, nonsmokers cannot smoke passively.  
Tobacco is a kind of drugs. Many people die for smoking every year in Japan. Drugs injure only users. On the other hand tobaccos injure not only users but also people around users. This is passive smoking. Nowadays, there are classified into smoking area and non-smoking area in many restaurants. However, in many cases it is not complete. Only a measure that classifies one space in two areas is not enough. This is because tobacco smoke spread and people in the restaurant including babies and women with child breathe smoke regardless of their will. If you made a wall between smoking area and non-smoking area, a problem could occur. Of course, customers are not injured by tobacco smoke. However, waiters are injured. Even if the number of people who are injured is small, we should completely ban smoking at all the restaurant in Japan. Some people sometimes insist smokerÅfs right. They say that it is natural that they can smoke everywhere at all time because tobaccos are legal different from drugs. It might be right. However, the human rights of victims of passive smoking are far more important than smokerÅfs rights. We canÅft ban smoking because it is legal. Therefore we must take action in order to protect ourselves from passive smoking. One of this is that smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. 
There are many matter related to smoking. Smoking has a bad influence on conditions of other guests. People with smoker has more risks that they get sick, say, lang cancer, even if they have never smoked. 35~62 thousand people die due to passivity smoking in the world ( asahi newspaper November 24, 1999). Besides tobaccoÅfs smoke has bad smell. So other guests will lose our appetites if we take a smell of tobacco. This is big issue at restaurants. Because restaurants are the place that we eat foods. The smell of foods is as important as the taste of those. When we are eating foods, we enjoy the smell of foods. But tobaccoÅfs smoke prevent us from enjoying that. Perhaps, there may be those saying that smokers have the right that they can smoke freely at restaurants. But non-smokers also have the right that they are smoked passively. If smokers allowed to smoke freely at restaurants, the non-smokersÅf right is ignored. Furthermore, if smoking is banned at restaurants, restaurants donÅft need to buy smoking stands. Then restaurants can reduce the cost so they can offer better services in lower charge. So smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in japan.
As you know, smoking not only harms smokerÅfs health, but also has a bad influence upon other one. Smoke of a cigarette includes nine thousand chemical matters. Cigarette cases of US sayÅhSmoking By Pregnant Women May Result in Fetal Injury, Premature Birth, And Low Birth WeightÅh. To make matters worse, smoke of a cigarette is famous for one of the causes of having lung cancer. Smoking is worse than useless. Whatever the case which heavy smokers are killed by smoking arbitrarily, nobody can stands to be harmed their health by someoneÅfs smoking. Also, restaurants are just place to eat. Smell of smoke is especially sickening such place. If smoke is not harmful, smoking at restaurants is not allowed. Smoking should be banned not only restaurants, but also every public places. There are the general public people. Perhaps they are invalid, or expectant mothers. Everybody must NOT trouble somebody.
I agree with the statement. Smoking is bad for health, and passive smoking is also bad. Restaurants are public spaces. If someone smoke in here, it is dangerous for many people. To make matters worse, smell of foods become badly. However, smokers will say that ÅgThere are smoking area and non-smoking area. If you donÅft want to smoke, you should go to non-smoking area.Åh There are walls between smoking area and non-smoking area, but smoke flows in the air. This is why smoking should be ÅgcompletelyÅh banned at restaurants. By the way, this essay should be written more than 200 words, so I should continue to write essay, but problem is happened. I already wrote my opinion. DonÅft give up. In Japan, tobacco tax is low compared with foreign country. So, many people smoke. Is it necessary to be completely banned at all the restaurants? This question is good point. I donÅft like smoke. But heavy smoker think
I agree this opinion. I am not a smoker. So I donÅft like smell of smoking. When I am eating something, if someone near me is smoking, I become unpleasant. And I turn irritated. Finally, I come to be able to eat few dishes and I will not order dishes any more. Other people should have experienced this situation like me. Recently nonsmoker is increasing. So, if the restaurant doesn Åft ban smoking, many people lose appetite and the number of orders will decrease !! At last, the restaurant will be out of business.  And as you know, smoking will harm peopleÅfs health. Only take the smoke which drift from other Åfs tobacco, there is a possibility of cancer. I donÅft want to become disease because of other Åfs careless. Surely people who have a habit to smoke may be relaxed by tobacco. When they feel stressed, smoking may release from the nervousness. And there may be many people who look forward to smoke soon after dinner. So they must be hard to put up with smoking at restaurant. But things are changing. The age which people can smoke everywhere and every time is over. So we have to obey social rules. Don Åft to annoy people around us by smoking. To live comfortably for everyone, only at restaurant, smoker should put up with smoking.  
I agree with this statement. One reason is that I think restaurants is the place where family with children enjoy eating the meal, and smoking have bad influence for children. Most parents with children always think about children's growth, so think that influence, most parents don't want their children to smoke in their life. In the second reason is smells of cigarettes spoil the dishes in the restaurants. When a dish carried, at fist you feel from the dish is an appearance and smell, if the restaurants should not be banned the smoking , people do not enjoy smelling the dish. And third reason is that smoker's tastes become funny, and become dull. Sommeliers do not smoke , because taste become not sensitive. So people who smoke do not enjoy feeling true the true taste of dishes in their life.   
In these days, prohibition of smoking is tightened more and more.  But I donÅft think so much to smoke should be completely forbidden at the all the restaurants in Japan.  However, many reasons would be offered, I want to give an opinion that cigarette is one of the most popular luxury item.  I think luxury items important for people, not only, cigarette but tea, coffee, and liquor. These items are not necessary for men, but they could make you pleasant, and that is funnily important. A person who knows the delight of enjoying luxury item seems to have a relaxed frame of mind. I think that attitude is one of the important factors to estimate a person. So smoking should be allowed at the restaurant, I think.  Many people will criticize that opinion. For example, cigarette smoke, especially side stream smoke is harmful for not only a smoker but also people not smoke.  But I think that problem will be solved easily. That is, dividing smoking area and no smoking area more severely. If a guest smokes in no smoking area, they warn him or take a more rigorous stand.  We have a right enjoying luxuries freely, provided they are not crime.  
I think we have to prohibit smoking in the restaurant, because the restaurant is the place where we should have a meal. The smoke prevents you from smelling the dishes and. You canÅft taste the meal so much. So you must feel uncomfortable if someone smokes in front of our table.  Not only the customers but also the managers dislike smoking in the restaurant, for the managers think smokers canÅft taste the delicious dishes very much. The managers do their best for the customer to enjoy their dinner. So the managers are very sorrowful if the customersÅf interest is not the meal but the smoke.   However the smoke also disturbs people around the smoker. It makes the managers very angry. Because the customers think the service of the restaurant is worse and they will never go to the restaurant.   It is very irritated for me to see a man smoking in the public place like the restaurant. DonÅft the smokers recognize their behaviors make other people unpleasant? Yes, they do, however they arenÅft considerate. If they are more considerate, they donÅft, for instance, smoke walking or throw away a cigarette. Sadly, however, there are few considerate people, so smoking in the public place must be prohibited.  
I agree with this statement. Smoking harms our health. If smokers are harmed their health by smoking, it is their own responsibility. But people who are near smokers are also harmed their health. It is very important thing. Almost all the restaurants in Japan have smoking area. When we enter a restaurant, a clerk of the shop says ÅgDo you smoke?Åh Of course, our university has smoking area and non smoking. So, some smokers say itÅfs O.K. But, I think smoking area is near non smoking area. It is meaningless. I have an experience. I went to a restaurant with my friend. Of course, we donÅft smoke. So, we sat down non smoking seat. However, there is smoking seat behind us. And, people sat the seat began to smoke. It is not strange thing. But for non smokers, smoking is very, very bad thing. We couldnÅft enjoy eating. Therefore, it is important to separate each area. For example, smoking is prohibited all the platforms of station except smoking area. This area is the edge of platform or room. But the restaurants donÅft have so large place. So it is difficult to make smoking area like station. Therefore, I agree with statement. Probably, some smokers say ÅgWe have a right to enjoy smoking!Åh But, I want them to think about non smoking people. And, I want to say them to stop smoking only at the table.
 What do you feel when you find the ash in your dishes? Probably, almost all people answer that that accident makes them displeasure. I often see who says something when he finds some dust or hair in his dish. On the other hand, nowadays we can hardly find the restaurant that is forbade smoking.    I think that to admit the smoking is as same as to admit putting in the ash in dishes. Maybe some smokers say that I never put in ash in dishes by my cigarette. But, in the fact that, smokes from the cigarette consists not of many detrimental thing but of many fine ash. This fine ash floats in the air as smokes, and fall in dishes. Smoking let us eat the ash.    We are no duty to eat ash and endure the smell of smoking when you are given a service in restaurant. Besides, the owner of the restaurant should give the regard that all customers have get the best service as far as possible, not to disturb their mind by admitting smoking. Then, some smokers may say that if smoking is banned in restaurant, it makes us so uncomfortable. Now, we will imagine, the child in front of you like insect like black beetle and he says that if he canÅft touch that, he feel much bad. You and that child eat with on same table and he put black insect on the table. Can you bear it? You certain say ÅgnoÅh. This is a example. You should not smoking someone feel uncomfortable in meal. 
I suggest that it is important not only in Japan but also in the world to ban customer from smoking at restaurants. Restaurants supply us with so very good food or drinks that we should taste them as they are. If we smoke, the taste and flavor of them will change to completely other things. That is too rudeness to cooks of restaurants. Restaurants also try to give all of guests very good time, but if someone smokes some guests who hate smoking feel uncomfortable.   These days many people donÅft like a cigarette or its flavor at any place. Especially the smoke of cigarette brings our bodies bad influences. So I think that restaurants which allow customers to smoke will get smaller number of guests than restaurants which donÅft allow customers to smoke will. At the point of view of popularity, restaurants had better not recognize smoking inside.   I talked about many reasons of agreement with the subject. If there still are those who want to smoke at restaurants, restaurants refuse them to enter or make the space to smoke outside restaurants. From many point smoking is out of order. In Europe warnings of a cigarette case say to us that smoking leads to death. Japanese expressions of a cigarette case should be hard and make people feel like not to smoke. LetÅfs discuss good ways, and make the atmosphere of restaurants very nice.    
First of all, saying my opinion about ÅgSmoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in JapanÅh, I agree with this idea. I also think smoking should be completely banned at all public places and I want to say to all smokers, ÅgIf you want to smoke a cigarette, please smoke at your private place!Åh There are two reasons why I say terribly about smoking. First reason, generally, non-smokers dislike the smell of the smoke of a cigarette. We, non-smokers, donÅft want to have a smell of the smoke of a cigarette and feel bad at a public place as a restaurant. An ordered dish also tastes bad. Second reason, breathing the smoke floating from a point of a cigarette (called Ågpassive smokingÅh) has very bad influence for our body, especially young children. A lot of young children visit a restaurant, so it can also be said that itÅfs crime to smoke a cigarette and let harmful smoke float at such a place. By the above mentioned two reasons, I think smoking should be banned at all restaurants. And I hope that smoking be completely banned at all public places, a campus of the college, a platform, and so on. 
I think that smoking should be prohibited at the entire restaurant.  There are many smokers in Japan. They are able to smoke at a restaurant for  instance.  Some restaurants donÅft separate smokerÅfs tables from nonsmokerÅfs table.  When nonsmokers drop into the restaurant, they must choose enduring smoke of  cigarette or stopping entering. When they choose enduring smoke of cigarette  and smoke spread in the room, they must become bad feelings.  At most of restaurants, smokerÅfs tables are separated from nonsmokerÅfs  tables because smoking makes not only smokerÅfs health but also nonsmokerÅfs  health bad condition. However nonsmokers can not help breathing smoke of  cigarette in the restaurant where smoker smoke even if they are separated.  Health of smokers gets wrong day by day if they go on smoking. And then  breathing smoke of cigarette is worse effect to their health than smoking.  In short, both smoking and breathing smoke of cigarette are unhealthy  behaviors very much and they one of main causes of cancer of the lungs.  Smoke of cigarette also makes their taste bad.  Furthermore wallpapers of the restaurant become dirty by smoking and ash of  cigarette makes unclean surroundings.  Those are the reason I insist that smoking should be prohibited at the  entire restaurant.  
To smoke does harm to you. To smoke makes your lung black and you become a lot of disease. Practically, when you compare smokers with non-smokers, smokers die than non-smokers the cause of cancer of lung and throat.  Since smoking is very bad for your body, I think that to smoke be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  There are a lot of people in the restaurant. So smoking does harm not only to himself but also to them. It smells bad. As a result, non-smokers are also equal to smoker in smoking. So many restaurants are divided two seat types, for smoker and for non-smoker. However, when I went to the restaurant, smokersÅf seats were vacant and non-smokersÅf seats were filled with people. Not only visitor but also restaurant loses in many ways. Perhaps, there are people who say, ÅgI canÅft live, if there no tobacco in my life.Åh They should smoke out of the restaurant. They should know that they do themselves harm and give trouble to a lot of people. Finally, I think they should stop smoking. Then, all the people become healthy and happy. I sure to that . So I disagree with smoking in the restaurant.  
Some people enjoy smoking, though they know that some bad substances which are contained in cigarette, for instance nicotine, tar and so on, affect their health. They, especially heavy smokers, may be irritated if they canÅft take a smoke, while taking meals or after. If smoking is forbidden at all restaurants, I think only nonsmokers and light smokers enjoy meals. But I want the heavy to have a good time too not only at lunch time but also at morning or at dinner. But other people hate completely cigaretteÅfs smell or smoke. ThatÅfs smoke affects those around the smoker as a passive smoker. As the means of an elimination of passive smoking, there is banning on smoking at restaurants, separating of the seats, or having equipments for filtering bad substances from the air. So it is no wonder that smokersÅf area is separated from nonsmokersÅf at restaurants these days. This is one simple means of keeping nonsmokers from affects of passive smoking. All restaurants should have also some machines that can change the foul air to the fresh air, for example an air cleaner. If so, at the same place nonsmokers and smokers can eat together. I donÅft think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan, if there are some rules or equipments for smoking like these.
I oppose the idea that smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Restaurants should be relaxant place for all people. So if all the restaurants ban from smoking at their place, a lot of smoking people lose a lot of relaxant places and all the restaurants. Smokers are better being given the place at restaurants. But then some people think that what should people who donÅft smoke or who donÅft want to be with smoking people at the restaurant do? I think that this problem is solved by establishing smoking room and nonsmoking room. In fact I donÅft smoke and I have not felt discomfort at restaurants if there were nonsmoking room there. So I think that smoking is not needed to be banned at all the restaurants. But I think that individual restaurant may prohibit smoking at own restaurant. The reason of that, each restaurant has various environments. For example a restaurant has very expensive curtain, furniture etc, and more. And the restaurant doesnÅft want those to be stain by smoking. In such a case, I think that the restaurant may prohibit smoking. But smoking should not be   completely banned at all the restaurants by politics of a nation, a countryÅCor a city.  
Smoking tend to be banned everywhere these days, for instance at stations or in taxi. I think it is very good tendency because smoking is too bad not only for smokers themselves but also people around them. I hate smoking and I canÅft understand why they smoke spoiling their health and money. However, I know that there are many people who are crazy about smoking and cannot give up it. If all the restaurants ban smoking, they would never find their comfortable places In Japan. Sometimes it would be their great stress and may lead some crimes. For these reasons, I donÅft completely agree with this idea. However, I think smoking place should be more separated from no smoking place. I work at a restaurant as a waitress. At my restaurant, there are smoking floor and no smoking floor. The first floor is only for no smokers and second floor is only for smokers. I think it is a great system because both of the smokers and no smokers can be very comfortable. Therefore, if there are some attentions that no smokers can be comfortable at restaurants, we donÅft have to completely ban smoking at all the restaurant in Japan.     
I think that we have to prohibit people smoke in all restaurants in Japan. That is based on two ideas.   First of all, a restaurant is the place where we enjoy eating. Tobacco has extremely strong smell.  And smell represents more than 50 percents of taste. In addition, smoke spread in the air. So if someone smokes in a restaurant, we might not be able to taste accurately. And if we are not able to taste accurately, we might not enjoy eating.  In the next, habit of smoking is harmful for our health. Recently, harm of smoke is noticed for a lot of people. It does not cause only smokerÅfs bad health, but also otherÅfs health. A restaurant is public space, so we should not cause trouble. For that reason, public spaces where we can have a smoke are decreasing. Restaurants in Japan should adopt this movement for the public benefit. And a lot of public spaces adopt this movement, smoker find the place where they can smoke difficult. If they are placed that situation long time, they donÅft smoke gradually. That might cause decrease of smoker.   ThatÅfs why I think that we have to prohibit people smoke in all restaurants in Japan
I insist that smoking has bad points but never has good points. Smoking is harmful for not only smoking people but also people around them. I think smoking should be completely prohibited, specially in restaurants and on street. In restaurant, people eat lunch or dinner. They enjoy the taste and flavor, but smoke makes their feeling not clear. This is why, many exclusive restaurants forbid guests smoking. Nowadays many restaurants in Japan divide seats into smoking seats and non-smoking seats. Do you think it is good idea? I donÅft think it is good idea, because it is unable to completely separate non-smoking people from smoker. The smoke enters non-smoking seats area and non-smoking people breath it. In addition, waiters and waitresses working there canÅft avoid from the smoke. I work restaurant twice a week. When I work as a waiter, I donÅft want to go smoker table. I donÅft smoke, so I hesitate it. So I always worry about my health. For instance, smoke may make my stamina down or make inside my body dirty. Like this, smoking makes non-smoking people feel uncomfortable. I think smoking should be banned at restaurant in Japan, even I think smoking should disappear from around the world.
Nowdays,many repot doesnÅft say smoking makes his health bad but also people around him. Smoking may cause lung cancer, heart attack, storks and some fatal disease. In Japan those disease come from smoking press the cost about medical. And some report says smoke from cigarettes are more harmful people are smoked around them than smoking people. Because of this, I think we must prohabit smoking in public place for example school, office, station or restraint.  If office worker canÅft smoke in office, he was able to smoke in out of building. It is not that he canÅft smoke everywhere. He smokes parkÅfs bench or his house too. On the other hand some people say we should make smoking area in public space. And we should admit smoking in smoking area. But to set smoking area need large space and it canÅft completely separte cigarettes smoke smoking area between other areas. I think this idea is not good way to admit smoking in public places. Now a lot o  f number people smoke, some of them throw away his cigarettes after smoking in anywhere. Such act makes more strict rule about smoking.  We should make the world smoking people and not smoking people live with comfort   
I agree with this opinion.  The smell of the cigarette smoke is unpleasant for me because I do not smoke the cigarette. Though the smell of the cigarette might be not anxious for the smokerÅCI think that many people who doesn't smoke the cigaretteÅ@will think the smell of the cigarette is unpleasant.   The restaurant is a place where people eat meal. PeopleÅ@should  come to the restaurant the atmosphere there and  to enjoy the smell and the taste of the meal. The smell of the cigarette might remarkably ruin them. Though there are a lot of restaurants where the smoking seat and the no-smoking zone are divided, there are some problems. The space has not divided completely. Even if in a no-smoking zone near the smoking seat, I feel the smell of the cigarette. It is often when it is necessary to sit on the smoking seat because the no-smoking zone is overcapacity. Namely, it is imperfect in measures of dividing the seat.  I think that it is painful for the smoker not to be able to smoke the cigarette. It is a problem to limit smoking too much severely. However, it might be not too painful to endure the cigarette while it eats in the restaurant.   Thus,I think that it is the most desirable that the restaurant stops smoking all seats.  
Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I agree this topic. First of all, non-smokers dislike cigarette smoke. If smoking doesnÅft be banned at the restaurant, they must smell it and their clothes will begin to smell of it. It is nothing but quite painful for them that smokers sit near their table.  Some restaurants separate the place where guests can smoke and canÅft smoke. However, non-smokers sometimes must seat at the place where guests can smoke there when the seats and guests are almost full.  Secondly, smoking is not healthy. There is no need to smoke at all. Everyone, rather, had better stop smoking. I hope so. For the reasons stated above, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.   
I think that smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.The thing that all the restaurant completely ban smoking is unbelievable.Some restaurants should allow people to smoke.There are many people who smoke in Japan.If all the restaurants completely ban smoking there,many people who smoke become depressed and have a lot of stress.Therefore,the restaurants which ban smoking have less guests than one which allow people to smoke there.So,I think that each restaurant should decide whether they ban smoking there or not.Now,I hate tabaco,but I may smoke in the future.Then,if I can't eat lunch or dinner smoking,I may tears.And I may commit suicide.Now that a lot of people suicide in Japan.I think that the increace of no smoking area is one cause of the increace of suicide.So,I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant.
I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Nowadays there is the tendency to prohibit people smoking in public places, such as in the transport facilities and in the buildings. Because cigarettes are bad not only for your health but also for other peopleÅfs health, more and more people gradually hate smoking. First of all, cigarettes have unique smell, so it makes good dishÅfs smell vanished and smokers themselves canÅft taste foods. In addition, cigarettes smoke badly and even if smokers are sit on the different seats, you will be did harm, since the smoke spreads over the restaurantÅfs room. In that case, if you are not a smoker, you go to the restaurant in order to enjoy having a meal but you canÅft do so. Secondly, it is natural that there are two kinds of people in the world: smoker and nonsmoker. Restaurant owner have problems about them. For instance, today, when nonsmokers notice that people smoke in the restaurant, some of them consent reluctantly to sit down and eat a meal. But others not only give up entering the restaurant but never go there as well. This is disadvantage for owner. In conclusion, restaurant is the place to enjoy eating and should be comfortable place for customers so as to have more delicious dishes. So you donÅft need smoking there
I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  Nowadays, more restaurants in Japan separate nonsmoking seats from smoking seats. However, nonsmoking seats often become full soon and people who donÅft smoke have to sit smoking seats.   I hate smoke of cigarette. It smells bad and penetrates into clothes. In addition, it makes me have a sore throat. For instance, guess that you have a dinner with your family cheerfully. On that time, if a man who smokes next to your table, smell of cigarette will spoil your delicious dishes and make you feel unpleasant.  When I see a man smoking in a public place, I get angry very much. Smoking, of course, makes smokers unhealthy. Moreover, smoke of cigarette has a bad influence on people who donÅft smoke. Smoking makes a possibility of getting cancer high.  There may be a pregnant mother or a baby in a restaurant.   And so if smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan, people who dislike a cigarette can enjoy themselves without being irritated about otherÅfs smoke. What is more, smokers have less opportunities of smoking and so, they can become healthy.  I hope smoking will be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan soon.    
I think that everyone who smokes always and everywhere should give up smoking  at the restaurant.   The reason is that  there are some people who dislike cigarette at the restaurant.  An act that it is smoked for the people who do not smoke during a meal is an annoying act.  There is the non-smoking seat in the restaurant, but it is still nominal.  The cigarette gives human health the bad influence.  That is why you should promote prohibition of smoking at the restaurant overall where there is a lot of people.  However, the smoker will object to prohibition of smoking.  They may insist on a right which is called the smoking.  we can eat the meal which is more delicious than now if there is no smoker  at the restaurant.  In addition, the nonsmoking flow is spreading out worldwide now.   The cigarette does you no good and much harm.   That is why I agree to the prohibition of smoking at the restaurant.  
Å@I agree with this statement because I think smoking isnÅft good for us at all. First of all I donÅft like smoke of cigarette. If someone sitting near me smokes cigarette in restaurant, I want to change the table where smokes donÅft come. Smokes of cigarette make me feel my dishes taste worse. There are a lot of people like me in the world. We go to restaurant not to eat bad dinner but delicious dishes. Smokes of cigarette are enemy of a good dinner.    Then, smokes of cigarette do harm our body. For instance, smoke of cigarette damage lungs. Heavy smoker is likely to get lung cancer. They also damage our heart, stomach, a blood vessel and so on. Smoking is no less harmful than poison is. Smoking is not only bad for people who smoke but also for nonsmoker around them. The influence on people around smoker is worse than that on smokers. This is a funny story.   Moreover, we canÅft quit a habit of smoking easily. Cigarette makes us feel like smoking more. Even if we decide to stop the habit of smoking, eventually we smoke cigarette again. There are a lot of people who canÅft stop habit of smoking.  Once we smoke, we continue to smoke forever.   For those reason, I want to ask all restaurant to ban smoking. 
I canÅft agree this idea.     To be sure, smoking may be very troublesome for those who are not smoking.  But I think that a little it is an excessive idea.  Because this troublesome be solved by advancing dividing the workplace into smoking and non-smoking sections.  I feel a cigarette no merit, and although I dislike the smell of a cigarette, a motion of the latest society seems to be cold in smokers too much.  I have a feeling that smoking is not so bad.  Probably, most smokers have the preparedness at the sacrifice of their life by smoking.  Some people may not have it.  If it is right, what problem is there when they think manners and smoking so that trouble may not be made to us?  It is the cause of those who do not consider manners and it is very sad that even smokers who really love smoking receive cold treatment.     If only a restaurant is forbidden to it, a smoker may try to finish a meal in other place other than a restaurant.   If it becomes so, only the restaurant industry will receive damage and it is also sorry it.     I think for smokers more kind policy should be made.       
A restaurant is a place where people enjoy not smoking but eating. There are many kinds of people in restaurants, families including young children for instance. If someone smokes near young children, his smoke makes their health bad without his notice.  Though, you have a right to relax with your own way, smoking gives other people much more infection than your contentment. That is why, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Even if each tables are divided into two parts, one is for smokers and the other is for non-smokers, their smoke is spread to all tables and spoils their meals. And more, the restaurant which is full of smoke looks dirty. In fact, there is a city law which bans smoking at all the restaurants in Yokohama. People who want to smoke while drinking or run bar are against this law. But I think that this law is the best way to make citizensÅfs health more good. As the place where people can smoke decrease, people who smoke also decrease. I wish that many cities should adopt such a law immediately. Then, everyone will be able to have a good time in all restaurants. So to conclude, I really believe that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. 
I agree with the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan because there are a lot of nonsmoking people who hate the smoke. I think it is important for Japanese people not to smoke too much. In Europe, people are accepting the trend of nonsmoking in public facilities. Japanese people should be more active to reduce the number of victims of lung cancer that is caused smoking too. In order to make the smoker give up smoking, the government should put more tax on tobacco, and the company which produces tobacco should withdraw from the business of tobacco. If the government put more tax on tobacco, the income will increase and the financial condition of the Japanese government will improve. As for the production of tobacco, in fact, JT, which is the only tobacco producing company in Japan has started withdrawing from the tobacco business. I think that the worldwide tobacco boom has ended. So, the day will soon come when smokers are avoided not only in the restaurant but also in everywhere. If they ban smoking at a restaurant, the number of customers may decrease. But if they ban smoking at all the restaurants, the smokers may give up smoking at restaurant and go to restaurant without smoking.
I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan because smoking is bad for the health. Smoking harms not only smoker's health but also another person's health. So the Japanese government is beginning to prohibit smoking. For example, school teachers are prohibited smoking inside an elementary school and a junior high school. When I was a junior high school student, school teachers are prohibited smoking not only inside buildings of school but also inside the others. In America, the state governments imposed a high tax on the cigarettes so that smokers try to give up smoking. As a result, the price of cigarettes rose and was more than 1,000 yen, but the policy was effective in giving up smoking. Therefore smoking is considered to be bad for the health in a lot of countries and many governments begin to adopt a policy to smoking. There is another reason why I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. In Japan, there are seats in the smoking section and nonsmoking seats in restaurants. But each seat doesn't completely be divided because we can't separate the air in seats in the smoking section from the air in nonsmoking seats. So people who sit a nonsmoking seat breathe in smoke of cigarette. Therefore I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  
I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  There are a few reasons.  First of all, if someone smokes at the restaurant, those who dislike smoke of cigarettes will be uncomfortable. Some people have disease of their lungs. If they take smoke in, their disease will be worse and worse.  Second, though there are some restaurants which separate tables where smoking is allowed from tables where smoking is banned, it is not very useful. For instance, assume that there are thirty seats where smoking is banned and twenty seats where smoking is allowed. If forty people who donÅft smoke and ten people who smoke come to the restaurant, ten people who donÅft smoke must wait and there are ten empty seats. This is not efficient. This is why it is not good to separate seats and smoking should be banned.  Third, it is no need to smoke during meals. Smokers should be able to endure smoking for just short time. It is said that if we eat meals with smoking, meals get less delicious. So we should not smoke during meals.  For these reasons, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.   
I agree with the opinion that taking a smoke should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  Firstly, taking a smoke is bad for the health and cigarettes harm not only those that usually smoke but also surround people near the smokers.  Such people are more likely to suffer from many kinds of disease than those that are never smoking. Statistics show that smokers are likely to die of cancer.  Secondary, those that have ever smoked tend to depend on taking a smoke.  These people are not able to stop smoking if they want to stop taking a smoke.  This sort of people is also highly likely to be tormented by many sorts of illness and die of various kinds of sickness.    Thirdly, it costs smokers much money to take a smoke.  Moreover cigarettes are very expensive. However cigarettes are a kind of dependence-producing drug, so smokers can not help buying them because they could not live one moment without taking a smoke.  Finally, when someone takes a smoke, those that are having something to eat are likely to hurt their feelings. For this reason, I would say that smoking must be banned at all the restaurants in Japan. 
I agree with this opinion. One of the reasons for this is that the smoke do harm to personÅfs body, and what is worse, persons who are damaged by this smokeÅfs influence are not persons who are smoking but those who are near the smoking person. In especially restaurants are closed spaces, where it is impossible not to breathe this smoke. Another reason, if there are smoking persons near us when we eat, this smoke would make meal tasteless. Not only persons who feel this smoke unpleasant, but also those who like smoking feel meal tasteless. This is because I heard a person who stopped smoking say that after stopping smoking, he feels meal delicious and he enjoys eating. This is why, in restaurants, in order that everyone enjoys and concentrates on eating, smoking at all the restaurants should be prohibited by the law. If smoking at the restaurants were banned by the law, someone who was once discomforted by smoking would not have to worry about smoking in restaurant and would not have to ask smoking person for stops smoking. And what is the most important merit for this is that when we eat, we definitely donÅft mistake the ashtray for the dish. Therefore I think that smoking should be completely prohibited at the restaurants in Japan. 
I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.Several of ÇçÇô friends who are smokinÇá cigarette say that it is a kind of puff to smoke a cigarette.Therefore, since it thinks that a restaurant is also a place which it has not only in the place which has a meal,I think that it is not necessary to make it prohibition of smoking completely at a restaurant.However, probably, partly, there are some persons who think that a cigarette is disagreeable. Therefore, although the nonsmoking seat is prepared, since it is meaningless if it is few at a restaurant from the first and a nonsmoking seat fills, you should cope with increasing a nonsmoking seat more etc. Moreover, there may be an opinion which cares about the manners side that what is necessary is just to smoke a cigarette to except during a meal,but since it thinks that tobacco is a part of a break as stated also like the point, I think that the opinion does not have effect.Probably, the blanket ban in our country will be too severe.  I am opposed to the blanket ban of the tobacco in Japan from these things. 
I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. First, smoking occur health damage to not only people who want to smoke but also people who never want to smoke in life. To prevent the thing, guests are separated in the restaurant. But it is not also perfect. For instance, donÅft you feel smoky at the separated area from smokers in the restaurant? Moreover, it is certain that we pass the smoking area for some inevitable reasons. For instance, toilet is near the smoke area. These are just evidences that preventing health damage is not perfect. Second, smoking may lose the quality of dishes. This is because smoking make our tongue numbed temporary, we lose our taste. This is why I wonÅft be able to taste foodÅfs real taste. This is bad not for only smoker but also chef. Because smoking also lose appetite so smoker cantÅf enjoy dishes fully, but almost all chef want guest to delight eat chefÅfs cook. If we smoke, these things donÅft be filled. Because of two things that I wrote, I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. 
I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. There are some reasons.  First of all, I hate smoking, so I want smoking to be forbidden.  Second, if someone smokes in the restaurant, the smoke will make non-smokers feel unpleasant. Some restaurants have some provision against smoker. For instance, smokers are separated from non-smokers in some restaurants, but a man who wants to smoke should get out from the restaurant.  Third, smoking is bad for health to not only smokers but also non-smokers. To make matters worse, the smoke non-smokers suck is worse than the smoke smokers suck. A man who lives with a smoker is liable to be disease. For instance, if you live with a smoker, the rate you get cancer will increase, and living with a smoker increase mortality among non-smokers. Moreover, the influence on children and the pregnant is   larger.  Such being the case, I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  
Now, few restaurants allow customers to smoke completely. And in almost all restaurants, it is partly banned or wholly prohibited to smoke. In addition to these facts, smoking is strictly restricted to smoking area in some European countries. This is because, to smoke dose harm not only to smoker but also to people in around. It is true that there is smoking space in some restaurants, but it is not enough to keep away smoke from non-smoker. Even in restaurant with smoking area, the area is usually open and just equipped with funs. Moreover when the clean air seat is full, some people have to sit in the seat filled with poison. Imagine the feelings of pregnant that sit in near smoking zone. Imagine the feelings of family with children who have to be seated in smoking section. Imagine the feelings of patients with problem in their throat are forced to sit in smoking seat. If it effect only to smoker, it can be permitted anywhere. But in fact, it is harm to everyone around people. Besides, cigarettes make furniture and wall colored or smells bad. And after smoking, it becomes trash. It cost shoppers to clean interior. ThatÅfs why smoking should be completely banned in restaurant.  
Smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan, because some people dislike smoke, other people feel irritate without smoking.    Smoke have a bad effect on people , especially pregnant women ,patients and so on. Non smokers are reluctant to have a dinner near to smokers. In fact, I dislike smoke very much, and I stop breathing ,when I am near to smoker.   On the other hand ,cigarette is a necessity for smokers. If they do not smoke for a long time, they will feel irritate, and they may become in a bad temper. They may not have a delicious meal due to not smoking.     the owner of the restaurants should separate smoking area from non smoking area.  The separation is distinct ,for instance smoking area and non smoking area is separated by wall and door. So, the smell of cigarette do not reach non smokers  and they need not worry to secondhand smoking. So, whether people smoke or not , they can comfortably have a dish and have a good time at restaurants.     Thus smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants but be allowed only at smoking space. Non smoker should also admit the space.  
Certainly, smoking is a bother for others. But smokers pay heavy tax when they buy them and in Japan tobacco is   legal over 20 years old, so they have smoking rights and they can   smoke at the restaurants.  Tobacco is a one of luxuries and many smokers may want to smoke during   or after a meal. They often say ÅgIt is very delicious that smoking after a meal   or drink.Åh  But non-smokers have rights of not to be exposed smoke naturally, too.  Tobacco smoke is very harmful especially for other people, and there   are many people who don't want to be exposed to that smoke.  We just want to enjoy eating or drinking delicious meals and talking   with friends at the restaurants.  How we can solve that simple question?  Now, there are divisions into smoking and non-smoking areas at the   stations or universities and so on. So it is necessary that dividing smokers from non-smokers at the   restaurant, too.  To  dividing smokers from non-smokers completely, it may be able to   make  a progress improving relations between smokers and non-smokers. And we have to understand each other, smokers and non-smokers.  After appropriate measure of smoke, smokers can smoke at the   restaurants in Japan. 
Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan, because smoking have a bad influence upon the smoking person but also surrounding. I donÅft smoke, and I donÅft like. Smoke of tobacco. When someone smokes around me, I get angry with his smoke makes my body bad. I go to a restaurant with smoker, I choose the nonsmoking seat as possible. There are all lot of people like me in Japan, and almost those people endure. If smoking is completely banned at restaurants, nonsmoker go in restaurants in peace. On the condition that restaurants ban smoking, there is no risk. To put it the other way around, the number of customers increase than before. It is better that smokers who want to smoke go out and smoke outdoor.  As another reason, banning smoking makes cleaning more easily. Smoking discharge smoke include tar which strain the ceiling and so on, and cigarette butts are left. Cleaning these is troublesome for employees. But by banning smoking, employees have no need to wash an ashtray and wipe the ceiling that is dirty with tar. According to this, employees can go back home earlier and rest in their home.  So smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. 
Restaurants in where all people enjoy dishes are not private place but public place.  It is various people in there; adults and children, family and couple, gentle men and women, noisy men and women, smoker and non-smoker, for instance. So if you have lunch in restaurant, you should think feelings of around people in there. If you are smoker, it is most important that think thinking of non-smoker.  In fact, I think smoke of cigarettes harm taste of foods. And smoke of cigarettes harms growth of children in restaurant.  People who want to smoke should smoke out of room after mealtime. Then smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.   For example, McDonaldÅfs near my home prohibits smoking in store because McDonaldÅfs think that smoke is obstacle for good taste of hamburger. It is very good idea!  And it is truth for smoker that smoke harms dishes. So in now, some restaurants have sheets for smoker, but all restaurants should abolish the sheet, if they want all people to enjoy good dishes.  Finally I want all restaurants to prohibit smoking in it and all people agree this thinking and enjoy food and conversation peaceful, cheerful in it.        
Nowadays, smoking often becomes banned at the various places. This thing is good trend, for smoking has many bad influences. There are many arguments for and against smoking. For instance, first smoking is incriminated as the major cause of lung cancer. Cancer is very very serious disease. And it is said that death rate is very high, and treatment is very difficult.   Second, at the restaurant, many people without regard to age or sex visit to eat delicious dishes, in various time. Possibly, some people hate smoking. These people would feel bad, if there are smokers at the restaurant. Although they have come from a great distance to eat delicious foods and to enjoy talking, it is spoil.  And passive smoking is worse for personÅfs health than usual smoking. Nonsmokers damage their health, although they donÅft smoke. If these person watch out for health, itÅfs meaningless. Many kids, baby, olds, pregnant women come restaurants, too. Passive smoking troubles those people. Especially pregnant womenÅfs case, smoking affects unborn babies. This thing is very severe and awful problem.  Recently, most of restaurants have a smoking seats, another usual seats. But it of many restaurants doesnÅft separate completely. It is meaningless.  So smoking should be banned at all the restaurants. 
Today, many restaurants in Japan separate ÅgSmoking seatÅh and ÅgNo-smoking seatÅh, so when we enter restaurant, clerk ask ÅgSmoking seat or no-smoking seat?Åh ThatÅfs show some people, like me hate cigaretteÅfs smoking, smell, and so on. However, will this measure of the restaurant be really effective? In many cases, partition between these seats is plastic, glass board etcÅc and smoke cannot be completely intercepted. Besides, air-conditioner carries unpleasant wind to no-smoking seat. With this, Non smoker cannot enjoy themselves enough over meal.   Almost all of people know smoking is not good for human body. In addition to this, secondhand smoke is worse than firsthand smoke. What an irrational thing this is! Smoking in the public place will not be an exaggeration to say pollution. For the nonsmoker, if smoke drifts in the store, a special meal is spoiled. We go to restaurant for eating, not to take smoke of others' cigarettes.   In Japan, it already tends to exclude smoking. For instance, the regulation that prohibits the walking cigarette is made, and the price hike of the tax is examined. Tobacco is said that ÅgThere are 100 harms and an advantage none.Åh It is glad that the chance to breathe in the smoke of the cigarette decreases.   
In Japan, smoking is banned recently.  Not only restaurants but also a number of facilities are banning from smoking .   It should be c completely to smoke in the restaurant.  Smoke flows into nonsmoking zone even if it is separated smoking zone from nonsmoking zone.  This means that nonsmokers are inevitable from the cigarette smoke   if smokers and nonsmokers are together .  According to is data, the cigarette smoke does persons by smokers, children, pregnant women and old people, more harm than smokers.   Furthermore, nonsmokers feel bad and canÅft enjoy having dishes because of the cigarette smoke.   It is rude to have something with smoke.  And to have something smoking is impolite for people who cook dishes.  Smoker must put up with smoking  during meal and can smoke in place where allows people to smoke.  It is natural to keep rule.  By these reasons, restaurant should be prohibited from smoking completely.  We should make restaurants nonsmokers can enjoy having dishes enough.  
 Cigarette contains various kinds of chemical material, for instance, nicotine, tar, and so on and those smoke also contain harmful material.  So cigarette smoke can make non smoker sick, for example, lung cancer.  Therefore non smoker have a right not to breathe cigarette smoke. Smokers give great risk to non smokers unconsciously. So restaurants have a great responsibility to defend non smokers.  We enjoy not only taste but also smell of dishes at restaurants.  If we smell tobacco when we eat dishes, we do not enjoy the dish and feel that dishes of this restaurant are not so delicious even if those dishes are very delicious. We probably have bad rumor that dishes of that restaurants are not so good or that restaurants do not prepare good condition for eating. Even if restaurants install seats of non smokers, non smokers cannot avoid tobacco smoke completely because we cannot see chemical materials which are released by smoking.  In order not to get bad rumor and in order to benefit, it is the easiest way for restaurants to ban smoking.    In the end, from these reasons, ashtrays should be eliminated from all restaurants in Japan.  
In these years, the Japanese government has recommended politics which smokers bother where they smoke calmly. For example, the government made streets nobody can walk or stay with smoking. We got cities clean and enjoy walking comfortably. Most people translate it as a very attractive policy.  So, all the restaurants in Japan should completely banned smoking too. We can especially find many bad situations in the restaurant. Their smoke makes not only them but also non-smoking customers more tasteless. If non-smoker were sitting far from smokers, they could not avoid smoke coming up. Then, passive smoking is a great important problem. As you know, smoking does damage smokerÅfs lugs and it leads smokers to have various bad diseases. Moreover, those diseases have a possibility to affect health of non-smokers who breathe smoke surrounding them. Smoke is more dangerous than we usually consider. Actually, smokers have troubled non-smokers while it is unknown. The restaurantÅfs floor is restricted within a narrow space. And customers sometimes turn up to eat with little children. So, all people at the restaurant are should be more attention to smoking.  In Japan, most people have seen smoking in any appearances in a new light. That present condition teaches us an importance to consider doing smoke. What smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan must bring good consequences.  
I agree to the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I have four reasons for this idea. First, today, researchers make great advances in smoking. According to their researches, smoking is very bad for human beings` health. For example, smoking increases a personÅfs risk of serious diseases: heart attack, cardiovascular diseases, lung cancer and more. So, smoking is harmful for people. Second reason is a matter of passive smoking. If a person smoke in restaurants, people around him do secondhand smoking. Serious disease risks of people exposed to passive smoking are higher than people who smoke. Third, there are people who simply do not like smell of tobacco. If you smoke in the restaurant, the smell of smoke is going to spoil the taste of the foods served at the restaurant. So, if you want to smoke, you should be smoke outside the restaurant. Forth, lighted cigarettes are dangerous. If children accidentally touch it, they burn their finger with it. In addition, cigarettes may be one of causes of fire. So, smoker should be care of cigarettes. In summarizing, smoking is worse than useless for people. So, I think that smoking should be banned at all the reataurants.
I agree with this idea.  I say about the reason why I object about smoking in the restaurant concretely.  First, many people enjoy eating their dish in the restaurant. Some people in restaurants, cigarettes smoke makes dish bad taste. Its smell is bad.   Approximately non smokers donÅft feel comfortable. For instance, my experiment said that smell have me be irritated because I couldnÅft concentrate on the taste. Maybe many non smokers think same that because my friend talked to me about similar thing.  Second, recently people have been interest in their health. But cigarettes smoke harmful. It is said that the smoke brings about cancer and many disease. In other words cigarettes smoke does harm our body. Some smokers try to quit smoking because of the fear of illness. Moreover Passive smoking causes non smokers illness. They are smoking unconsciously in the restaurant. It is very dangerous situation. So we must change that. Third, now there are many smoking banned spaces in Japan and it has been increasing. In addition that smoker canÅft smoke almost all public spaces such as train station and concert hall. Of course, restaurants are public space. All things considered, all the restaurants in Japan should disable smokers to smoke.   
In Japan smokers are freer than in other country. In other country, they are banned strictly and they feel that they are not comfortable. People who donÅft smoke can deny smokers and can say Ågplease donÅft smoke hereÅh. But Japanese smokers donÅft feel so uncomfortable and other people donÅft have the right which refuses smoking. Japan should be severer to smokers in every situation. Restaurant is one of the situations. So, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. In addition, restaurants serve us with delicious foods or drinks. Eating wonderful foods is most precious and happiest time in life. That time must not be spoiled by smoking. Most of people who donÅft smoke feel smoking very bad. Because of smoking, delicious foods will be terrible foods. Restaurants make our great time and get money by us. Restaurants should consider them and choice the best way to make us happy. Add to this, Japan is behind other advanced country in various manners and view to around problem, environment, global warming and so on. Other country may recognize Japan as developing country in these fields. So, Japan has to renew its society and should be truly advanced country. As first step, I agree smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants. 
  People who smoke frequently say that smoking is ÅgoishiiÅh. ÅgOishiiÅh generally means delicious in Japanese. However, in this case, what it really means is not delicious but Ågfeeling relaxedÅh. This idea may be beyond comprehension for people who donÅft smoke, but at least it appears that some people feel at home by smoking.    At restaurants, people often eat, drink, have a conversation with their friends or family, and so on. That is to say, it is not too much to say that at restaurants each person spends his time feeling relaxed in some form or other. Then, thinking smoking plays an important role in the comfort of people, it can be said that itÅfs all right to smoke at restaurants.    Nowadays, a lot of people have thought that smoking does you no good and much harm, so they would like cigarettes to be completely done away with. However, it seems that this idea is only from the side of health. Smoking is not entirely good for health, to be sure, but whether smoking is good for health or not isnÅft important here because this is a personal problem. If people in good health complain the cigarette smoke does harm, they will make seats in the smoking section, and have already wrestled with this problem at almost all the restaurants in Japan. Therefore, smoking doesnÅft have to be ÅgcompletelyÅh banned at all the restaurants. 
Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I agree with this statement. Smoking is a treasury of toxic substances, such as nicotine, tar and so on. Nicotine leads smoker to toxicosis, and tar triggers lung cancer. Smoking causes toxicosis or cancer not only to the smoker but also to the nonsmoker who is around the smoker. This kind of nonsmoker is called Åga passive smoker.Åh In general, a passive smoker hates the smoke from a cigarette due to its smell and an impression of its harm. So it is disagreeable for a passive smoker in the restaurant. It is not complicated to imagine that smoke in the restaurant decreases customersÅf appetite when they have lunch or dinner. Nowadays, smoking is almost entirely banned in public places, but many restaurants have smoking area or seats for smokers. I think however, smoking in the restaurant should be prohibited before everywhere else, for customers must be in the restaurant for a long time, from half an hour to an hour if long. The longer they are in the restaurant, the heavier they harmed by smoke if someone has a smoke. In these points, there is no need to dare to smoke in the restaurant.
Most of restaurants hope that all their guests enjoy their meal. Restaurants cook the meals in order to please their guests. Some guests enjoy their meal more when they are smoking than when they are not smoking. Then, smoking does not have to be banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Perhaps you will say that those who do not like smoking are not pleased with meals if those who are smoking are near. If so, you should divide an area into two areas &#8211; a smoking area and no smoking area. This way, all the guests are pleased with their meal in the restaurants. Nevertheless, if you say that you want to ban smoking in the restaurants, you could do so. I do not oppose what you do. Some restaurants can ban smoking there. But smoking should not be banned at all the Å@restaurants! There are a bunch of people who likeÅ@smoking at the meals. Where could they have meals if smoking will be banned at all the restaurants? They would not have meals at any restaurants. They have the right to enjoy meals. If there are some restaurants in which smoking are allowed, they can smoke at meals and enjoy meals. A good meal is the meal at which guests enjoy it.  
At present, some strict rules about smoking have been established by this country and autonomies. For instance, there are regulations that people underage may not smoke and every people must not smoke in the street except admitted smoking lounges. WhatÅfs more, smoking is not permitted in the train stations and the inside of a taxi, not to mention the hospitals. Then, why arenÅft smokers completely banned from smoking at all the restaurants?  Since people who care much for his health have been increasing, issue of passive smoking come to the surface in recent years. The restaurant is a place to enjoy meals. If cigarette smoke hang over you when you enjoy your meal, it may difficult for you to feel nice smells and flavors of foods. And you are bound to breathe in cigarette smoke as you take foods in your mouth.  Though you have restaurants which you can choose between smoking table and nonsmoking table, cigarette smoke come in nonsmoking table through smoking table at almost all of the restaurants. In brief, it is no use dividing smoking table from nonsmoking table and setting up smoking room. I suppose that smokers should tolerate to smoke at least while he is at the table. 
Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. This is because I have several reasons.  The first reason is that smoking is not good for smokers. The data shows that more and more smokers are killed by the lung cancer because of smoking. In fact, my friendÅfs uncle was smoking heavily. He was smoking about thirty cigarettes a day. As the result, he was killed by a lung cancer when he was forty years old. The second reason is that smoking is not also good for people around smokers. I know that smoke out of the smokers is much worse for health than smoke smoked by the smokers. The final reason is the most important. For instance, a family was looking forward to eating out at a rich and famous restaurant. The family was not so rich that they could eat out at such a rich and famous restaurant only once a year. At last, the day when they eat out came. They sat down at each seat. The dishes were put on the table in front of them. They began to eat. However, they smelt cigarette. The family looked around them. The visitors around them were smoking. How sad this situation is! This is why smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. 
Should smoking be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan? Nowadays, it is the known fact that smoking do harm to our health. Smokers have a higher risk of getting lung cancer than non-smokers. And if expectant mothers smoke, they do harm to the development of their fetuses. Above all, the serious problem to solve is that smokers, with their smoking, do damage not only to the health of themselves but also to that of other people around them, unlike with their taking alcohols. However, we should not ban smoking at all the restaurants. In restaurants, people allow smokers to smoke in particular seats they give smokers. If these seats are apart from the ones non-smokers sit, smokers never do harm to non-smokers in restaurants. Imagine smoking were completely banned at all the restaurants. If so, smokers smoke outside of restaurants and may do harm to non-smokers outside like children or expectant mothers. This is the awful situation. The particular seats for smokers make smokers to forbear their smoking outside. Of course, if, in some restaurants, people who run them have not separated the seats for smokers from the ones for non-smokers yet, they should do it as soon as possible.
 In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.   One reason is that the smoke of tobacco has a bad influence not only on smokers but also on passive smokers who are near smokers. It is often said that the influence on passive smokers is heavier than the influence on smokers themselves. Smoking can do harm to passive smokers. Customers enter the restaurant not to be damaged but to enjoy having lunch or dinner.     Second reason is that smoking cause the restaurant to be full of smokes. The smoke goes to the dishes, and the taste of them become worse. People, particularly nonsmokers feel uncomfortable to inhale tobaccoÅfs smoke. The smell is very important to the dish. When the smell become worse, the tastes also become worse.   Third reason is that the cost of maintenance falls down. TobaccoÅfs smoke goes to the clothes of waiters and waitresses, and the cost of wash become higher. The smoke also goes to the walls of the restaurant, and the cost of cleaning become higher in order to remove the smell of the smoke.   That is to say, I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.    
Å@I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in   Japan.  Restaurant is a public space.  So, in a restaurant there are a lot of    people including nonsmokers.  If a man smokes in a restaurant , that smoke    will immediately spread there because a restaurant is usually not so large.    Then, that smoker may feel comfortable, but most of nonsmokers will feel    bad.  Some people who dislike the smell of smoke may lose their appetite.    In Japan, the number of nonsmokers is larger than that of smokers.  So,    considering the public benefit, smoking should be completely banned at all    the restaurants in Japan.       In some restaurants, smokerÅfs space is divided from nonsmokerÅfs.     Recently, this system have been introduced in a lot of restaurants and coffee    shops.  But, smokerÅfs space is not completely separated from nonsmokerÅfs.     So, nonsmokers breathe the smoke unless smokers stop smoking there.         In addition, scientists say that passive smoking have a bad influence on    nonsmokers.  Smoke in passive smoking contains a lot of poisonous    substances.  If a nonsmoker stays by a smoker, the risk that nonsmoker    will have a cancer will increase.  In order not to damage nonsmokerÅfs    health, I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the    restaurants in Japan.  
There are a lot of heavy smokers in Japan and they often smoke during eating and after eating. If smoking were completely banned at all the restaurants, they wouldnÅft enjoy eating at the restaurants. They feel it uncomfortable that they arenÅft permitted to smoke and donÅft go to the non-smoking restaurants. Then, people who go to the restaurants are almost only non-smokers. The number of customers may greatly decrease. It is bad for the restaurants. Smoking need not be completely banned. It is better to divide the area of the restaurants into two. One is the area where people can smoke, and the other is the area for non-smoker. This way makes each people come to the restaurants and enjoy eating at the restaurants. It is important for the restaurants that the customers enjoy and feel happy.   
I am for the idea.There are some reasons.First,I hate smoke,especially while I am eating.With smell of smoke,any food become the worst of all foods.If smoke with a long distance,smoke flows to my place and if it is a little,it will make me feel sick.Second,a lot of people donÅft like smoke.It is obvious ,as see the govementÅfs movement,for instance,decreasing smoking area,arising price of tabacoÅc.Somokers may say that Ågif you donÅft like smoke,you should sit non-smoking seat.ÅhI can understand what he want to say,but,speaking,as a worker in a restaurant,not all restaurants separate smoking seat and non-smoking seat.Even if separated,it is unclear.When many non-smoking customers come to a restaurant,and non-smoking seats are filled,clerks would take customers to smoking seat.So,without banning smoking,all customers are possible to smell smoke.Third,smoke is bad for both smoker and people around him.Generally,who agrees the idea is the later,but,for the smorker ,the idea isnÅft bad.Now,banning smoking is the trend.In my opinion,sooner or later,the day when it is hard to smoke will come.Then,smoker had better agree the idea and decreases opportunities to smoke.It takes a lot of time to give up smoking.Then,do such things and stop smoking before many difficulties confront you,it is the wise celection,isnÅft it?
ÅgWe get much harm, but no plus.Åh     There is such a proverb in Japan. This is often used about cigarette. Thus, smoking is not seen a good thing. Smoking does harm to smokers, but also nonsmokers. Cigarette has two types of smoke. One is mainstreamÅ@smoke, the other one is sidestreamÅ@smoke. MainstreamÅ@smoke is smoke which smokers are inhaled directly. SidestreamÅ@smoke is smoke discharged from top of cigarette.     Here, it is an important problem that sidestream smoke do more harm than mainstream smoke. If someone smokes in the place there are many nonsmokers, they will be done more harm than someone. And, if one of them is suffered from asthma, he may have a fit of coughing. So, smoking should be banned at the place there are many people. For example, train, shop, college school, and restaurant. It may be restriction for right of smokers. But It must not be that the right to disturb the health of others. Cigarette is obstacle for living close together.   
Today, many people smoke in Japan. The main health risk in smoking relate to disease such as heart attack, lung cancer and asthma. Mostly, Tobacco-smoke is thought productive of these diseases. Some of smokers smoke in public place, such as bars, restaurants, stations, bas stops, and etc. Tobacco-smoke gives any bad influence for not only smoker but also non-smoker. Tobacco-smoke gives us any bad influence. These days, several countries have legislated against smoking in public places, often including bars and restaurants. In the United States, many states prohibit smoking in restaurants, and some also prohibit smoking in bars. If many public places have a smoking place, non-smoker avoid getting any bad influence. However we could not avoid entirely getting any bad effects and not get any bad effects. If we want to maintain health condition, we should ban at all the public place. Especially, in restaurants, smoking should be completely banned at all in Japan because restaurant is indoor place. Even if there are smoking place in restaurants, smoke spread over any place. Even if we make smoking place for non-smoker, smoker smoke and they get any bad influence. So, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
Now, some restaurants have separated nonsmoking seats from smoking seats. But that is not effective if smoking is banned completely at restaurants. That is why we cannot stop smokes from cigarette from invading nonsmoking seats. As a result, the situation at nonsmoking seats is the same as that of  smoking seats. Also, there are a lot of children or people who are not allowed to smoke. Smoking affects them badly by their seeing people smoke. For instance, they may snuff smokes or they may start smoking by seeing that often. In fact, the number of the children whose parents smoke smoking is mor e than that of the children whose parents donÅft smoke. And if the man couldnÅft help smoking, he might get out of a restaurant.  In the first place, restaurants are not where people smoke or chat but where people enjoy eating dishes. People should concentrate enjoying eating or drinking. And smoking may prevent us from eating original tastes. In short, smoking may alter tastes. Then those who smoke cannot get anything at the  restaurant. It is true that they relax by smoking, but, at restaurants, that doesnÅft bring them anything good, but that brings people around them criticizing. 
Smoking has tended to dislike by many people since ancient times. These days its tendency seems to strong. It is said that to smoke brings no good and a lot of harm not for any smokers but also neighbors who do not any smoke. Furthermore, smoke that neighbors may take in their body is more dangerous than smokers breathe in. It is what is called Passive Smoking.  Recently Japanese government suggests price of a smoke would be around 1,000 yen. Newspapers search many people what was their opinion for governmentÅfs suggestion. According to the results of an opinion poll, over fifty percents of people who answered questions did not oppose it. If price of a smoke rises, many smokers would stop smoking and then nonsmokers do not have to smoke regardless of grate hate.  If we walk in a city, we would see many smokers. But we can escape from them. By contrast when we are in a restaurant, we cannot escape their smoke. Restaurants must be clean because there are the places where people eat or drink various foods. We might be harmed unconsciously with eating foods because smokeÅfs smoke is likely very strong poison.  From that reasons, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. 
You should not smoke at restaurants in Japan. Because smoking is not match with restaurants.  First how places are restaurants? They are the spaces where people enjoy meal, without disturbance from others; however you also should not disturb others. You can talk with your friends, use cellular phone and do your homework, but you must not make a loud voice or sound there.  Next what does smoking cause? Of course, cigarettes make smoke. It makes people feel unpleasant in many ways. Its smell is very bad; besides, it includes harmful matter for human body. A lot of people know the fact and almost all of them dislike the harmful smoke. Some feel unpleasant though they only see the smoke. That is to say, smoke from cigarettes can bother people.  From the above, it is natural you should not confuse the two factors, restaurant as place and smoking.  Nowadays, many restaurants have provided both smoking area and no smoking area. They have believed that customers were not disturbed by any smokers because they kept distance each other. But the fact the two factors have been confused in the same space is not good.  That idea is wrong. So, all the restaurants in Japan should completely ban smoking. 
There are many people smoking at a restaurant in Japan. I think that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. There are two reasons I think it. First, smoking give not only mans who smoke but also who donÅft smoke unhealthy effects. It is called passive smoking. Especially children and expectant women are given very bad influences by smoking and passive smoking. At a restaurant even if there are smoking lounges, people who donÅft want to smoke may breathe smoke from cigarettes. They will feel so bad and may lose their appetites then. But if people who smoke heard these talks, there would not be a lot of people who decide to stop smoking at a restaurant at once. So I think that smoking should be completely at all restaurants in Japan to protect people who donÅft want to smoke. Second, to make smoking lounge needs large place to divide between smoking lounges and nonsmoking seats. In there are many restaurants which canÅft prepare large enough to make them. Owners who manage those restaurants have to build smoking lounges near nonsmoking seats. It is more and more possible that people who donÅft like cigarettes breathe smoke from them by passive smoking. So government in Japan should make laws which ban smoking at all restaurants.   
I think that smoking should be forbidden at all the restaurants in Japan.  Recently, I often hear the word ÅgnonsmokingÅh everywhere. I think that smoking should be forbidden at place where a lot of people are because the cigarette smoke affects our health. Even if we donÅft smoke a cigarette, our bodies receive the harm if there is a person who is smoking a cigarette around us. Above all, it is said that children are more likely to receive the harm, and there are many children in restaurants. There are a lot of harmful things we receive by smoking cigarette or breathing cigarette smoke from the cigarette which the person around us smokes.   There are some people who donÅft like the smell of cigarettes. I donÅft like it, too. People go to a restaurant to enjoy eating dishes. I think people enjoy the smell of dishes, too. If a person smokes a cigarette in a restaurant, people who enjoy eating dishes around there couldnÅft enjoy the smell of dishes.    Of course, there are many people who smoke cigarette. Such people would have troubles if smoking is banned at all restaurants. But there are many people who donÅft smoke cigarettes, too. I think people who want to smoke cigarettes have to smoke outside.  
It is said that tobacco is a poison, harmful for our healthy, and it is caused of cancer and other severe disease. Many people die from smoking around the world each year. And recently, it is often said that secondhand smoke is more dangerous, especially for children. In the small room like restaurant, there is a lot of danger of secondhand smoke. Some restaurants in Japan, there are divided two types of seats, smoking seat and no smoking seat. But sometimes the two seats are closed. So if someone smokes in the restaurant, there is also a danger of secondhand smoke even if we seat no smoking seat.  Therefore, to remove the danger of it, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. And it may enable to decreases the number of smoker. Many countries, especially America and Europe, make many laws and regulations to restrain from smoking. And there are often banned from smoking at all the restaurants. But some Japanese people donÅft consider the danger seriously. They think that smoking is not so harmful for us. For that reason, Japanese laws and regulations about smoking are less and easier than that of other developed countries. But it should be more strictly in Japan. Smoking is harmful, not any good. 
I am opposed to forbidding smoking at all the restaurants. Incidentally, I am not smoking.  As one of the reasons, for a smoker smoking tobacco is relaxed one. Restaurants aim at thing that all the visitors have a meal with a pleasant and sufficient feeling. Nevertheless, for a smoker prohibition of smoking is only pain. Actually, you see the scene smokers enter after smoking tobacco before going into the place where a smoker cannot smoke. Prohibition of smoking is pain for a smoker so much. Then, it is putting the cart before the horse. I do not regard making anything prohibition as a clever way. Therefore, smoking is not given up in all area in a restaurant. Those who do not smoke dislike the influence by the smoke of tobacco. Therefore, what is necessary is just to separate the place where smoker can be smoking and the place where they cannot be so more than now, for instance, the smoking car of a train etc.  After all if it think actually, in Japan the consciousness to the health impairment caused by tobacco is low. And take various problems into consideration, it is impossible to ban smoking at all the restaurants. Even though it can do, I will oppose it.  
 Recently, smoking has been banned at many places such as planes, buses, trains and so on. That is because smoking troubles many people.  Tobacco has many toxic chemicals. Smokers sometimes suffer from serious diseases, such as lung cancer. Besides, smoking does harm not only to smokers but also to non-smokers. Non-smokers can breathe smoke and fall sick if they are near smokers. It is called passive smoking. Some non-smokers will know this and hate tobacco. Especially, in the restaurant, many people will enjoy eating and talking with friends or families. If some people smoke, the restaurant is filled with smoke and people feel unpleasant. Then, they can no longer enjoy talking and taste dishes. It is very unhappy. Restaurant is the place where many people relax and enjoy dining. Customers go to restaurant for the purpose of it. They should not be offended by smoking. Smoking should be strictly banned at the restaurant.  However, some non-smokers may argue that they cannot enjoy eating in the restaurant if smoking is banned there. But restaurant is the special places. Smokers can smoke in private places, such as their home but customers can enjoy eating better than usual only at the restaurant. Non-smokers should be respected.
I think that smoking should completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. Th ere are four reasons to explain my opinion. Let me introduce the reasons.  First, the smell of smoking is so bad for not only smoking people's health bu t also non-smoking people's health. Perhaps smoking people accept some bad eff ects for their health, but people who don't smoke don't want to be a patient b ecause of smoking effects. And if there are some effects for non-smorking peop le, smoking people don't have any responsible for that nevertheless the people  who smoked nearby the effected people who don't smoke is them.  Second, if there is a restaurant in which anybody can smoke, the income will  decrease. Because some of the people who don't smoke don't go to the restauran t. They hate the smell and the smoke, and they go through the restaurant as so on as looking at the smoking people in the it.  Third, the restaurant in which anybody can smoke is bad for the people who ha ve been smoked and try not to smoke. If there is the restaurant, perhaps some  of the people will smoke.   Fourth, I don't like smoking people.   So I agree with the opinion. I think that restaurants should be the place in  which nobody smoke. 
Today, a lot of restaurants ban smoking at all tables in Japan. It is very good tendency. Smokes spoil chefÅfs good dishes. Smell of smoke robs appetite of people. In addition to this, smokes make peoplesÅf body illness gradually. Because smokes in top of tobacco are worse than these in end of tobacco, whether a smoker is careful of others or not, he or she never smokes without bothering others. We should not smoke. If that tendency expands to all places, a lot of people will quit smoking. Also population of lung cancer is increasing. This disease is caused by custom of smoking. The more people quit smoking, the fewer death rates are. People who are not over 20 years old are banned smoking. But some of them have habit of smoking. This is due to adults. Adults should watch them not to get tobacco. In order not to get tobacco, its vending machine should be banned soon, and price of it should be high. If government started these two plans, we could reduce population of smokers. I hope that all over the world ban tobaccoÅf vending machine and smoking in all places. I want to see world that no one smoke some day. 
Recently, smoking has been banned in public places. This trend is spreading the entire world.   For instance, in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Finland, Singapore and the EU smoking is prohibited in public place and fine for smoking is very much. Yet in Japan there are a few places where smoking is banned. And fine is small. So compared with the law of smoking in developed countries that of Japanese is so slack that the government in Japan has to enforce the strict rule.  Public places should be comfortable and relaxing for everyone. But smoking is a very bad smell for some people who don't smoke. Restaurant is public place and all of people have to be able to relaxing there. So smoking should be banned at all the restaurants.  And the cigarette smoke make dishes awful. Some restaurants have divided the spaces into two areas, smoking area and nonsmoking areas. Yet this system is not enough to completely provide smoke from streaming into nonsmoking area. Besides lately, plenty of hotels have decided to forbid smoking there. After this, most of place, of course streets, smoking are banned. People have better smoke in smoking room not to hurt people's feeling.  
Recently, men who smoking in Japan gradually have been decreased, but many people have still smoked. Most of them smoke in restaurant, road, office, etc.  Not surprisingly, we know that smoking has exposed a man who smoking to cancer and others serious disease, because this is often reported by many researchers.  But smoking harms not only smokers for himself but also non-smokers around smoker.  This is called Ågpassive smokingÅh. A cigarette can spread many health problems for many people if people live around smoker.  Nowadays, restaurants in Japan separate smoking seats from non-smoking seats, but it is a fact that how far smoking seats are separated from non-smoking seats, smokers and non-smokers are spending times on eating foods and drinking tea in the same building; space.   From the other point of view, cigarette smokes have peculiar smells, so people who are eating foods in the same room in which the man smokes cannot enjoy the smell and taste of food because of the smells of cigarette smokes. Smoking can prevent from enjoying meals.   Furthermore, many ashes of cigarette are left by smoking. By an ashtray, most of them are caught, but a little of them arenÅft caught. Restaurant must keep rooms clean, so smoking in restaurant can bother people who use after seat smoker used to enjoy eating foods. 
Nowadays in Japan people tend to dislike the tobacco. There are a bunch of places where smoking is prohibited. For instance in hotels, on streets, at colleges and not only in trains but also on platform. So only at restaurants smoking is not banned that is strange. Smoking should be thoroughly forbidden at all the restaurants.  One of the reasons is that if many smoking people are in the restaurants, we would feel its atmosphere to be not good. A restaurant is a place where we have a good meal and where we spend time comfortably. Secondly some of customers who come to the restaurants are family. Sometimes the family has the babies. To babies tobaccoÅfs smoke is very bad. The restaurants should make visiting all families very happy. So smoking ought not to be allowed.  Nowadays the rules of Japan gradually begin to be rigid. But they are not stricter than the rules of Singapore, America, United Kingdom and France. There smoking is almost prohibited. For instance if we are in one of the countries, it is natural that we donÅft watch a TV commercial. And if we walk there, we would donÅft look the advertisements on streets. Japan should imitate these. 
There are many arguments for and against smoking.  However, I agree this idea which smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  Firstly, I dislike the smell of the smoke and if I snuff up it, I maybe lose my appetite.  Secondly, smoking cause various disease such as lung cancer , stroke, asthma.  Smoker often cause these disease but if I snuff up smoking, I also cause such disease  Moreover, passive smoker are more harmful than smoker. Because, passive smoking contain more harmful materials than smoking.  So, it is very unfair. Why I am damaged by smoker? I am very angry when people walk with smoke.  Finally, Smoking sometimes wound others badly.  For instantly, my junior high school friend has been troubled with asthma for long years. One day I and he go to the shopping. When we meet smokers in the restaurant, my friend suffer from smoke and finally his breathing is very slow and weakened. So, I take him into the hospital.  So, I perfectly agree that smoking should be banned at the restaurants in Japan.
Nowadays, it becomes more and more difficult to smoke. In some place you can't buy it without permission of machine which is lately introduced and discern individuals by their faces in order to prevent young people from buying it. In the other place you can't smoke while you are walking. You should pay 1000 yen fine if you are witnessed by them. They earn 60000 yen in three weeks. Some people even say raise the price itself   to 1000. So why not, restaurants also should make smoker at unease. In Japan we rarely warn smoker. This is famous phrase "too much smoking have possibility to do you harm" Is this advice or something? In Japan this is the very warning. Cigarette do them harm and are useless. Of course restaurants don't have to care health of their customers. If they hesitate to serve food to overweight person, they can't go around. But don't you want to go such restaurants?  in the case of cigarette, it is worth doing. Practically, some restaurant don't make seat for smokers. But only family restaurants which have a big chain can afford to do that. It is no longer matter of health or manner. It is the opponent to extinguish.   
Recently, many regulations about smoking are enforced. For instance, in some area if people walk with smoking, they are fined. This rule is wonderful for non-smokers! IÅfm 18 years old so I cannot smoke. But I donÅft want to smoke. Smoking hurt feelings. When you eat lunch with your friends, next customer is smoking. Then what do you think? Perhaps you think nasty, you do nothing but complain about the smoker with them. Eventually you spoil lunch time. WhatÅfs more, smoking destroys our body. By smoking, our stomach is dirty. And compared with non-smokers, smokers are apt to get cancer. The death rate of smokers is also very high than non-smokers. That is to say, smokers want to die quickly. Smokers say that smoking is our pleasure. But I cannot understand their words. When I was 8 years old, I smoked once. It was too hard for me to smoke to end. What on earth is pleasure? Probably, there is no advantage to smoke. I hope that one day tobacco will be clear completely. It is the best means for the world. We want to get very clear air. 
I agree with the idea.    Nowadays there are less and less people who smoke than there used to be. It is because a lot of people realize that smoking is very harm to our health. For example, if pregnancy women smoke, babies in their womb cannot breathe a few seconds and it is said that people who smoke constantly more likely to get cancer of lungs than people who never smoke. However, if a person smokes at public space such as restaurant, many people who are in there have to smoke passively or escape from there not to smoke passivelyÅD The worse thing is that passive smoking is more harmful than active smoking. Although some people say that smoker's rights should be protected, protecting rights of people who don't want to smoke is much more important.    In addition, smoking is one of a luxury like drinking but smoking people must have a lot of risks, for instance cigaretto is very expensive due to special tax and very harmful, but they donÅft have any profits different from drinking  Some Japanese people, especially young boys, think that smoking men are so cool under the influences of that a lot of Japanese men smoke at public area, but cigarette is a kind of drags.  We must reject smoking area from public space like restaurant to prevent young people from starting smoke.   
 In Japan, passive smoking, which often endangers non-smokersÅf health, is taken as one of the most serious problem. Therefore, many places have become non-smoking areas and still they are increasing. Indeed, we cannot regard it as a good practice. But smoking is not illegal for adults. So completely banning from smoking in all the restaurants is too strict. Moreover it can be one of the discriminative rules such as apartheid. Since we can smoke legally as long as we have lived more than twenty years, there should be both smoking areas and non-smoking areas in every building as there are both menÅfs rooms and womenÅfs room. But on one hand we have the right of smoking, on the other hand we have no right of hurting others. That means that smokers must be careful not to harm others. While smokers must care not to injure othersÅf health with the smoke they blew in restaurants, of course, there are limits of their efforts. To support them and make smoking customers and non-smoking ones comfortable together, restaurants need to do some solutions, perfectly separating both areas with walls for instance, instead of refusing smokers entering. For peopleÅfs happiness on each side, we should not quarrel with each side but seek the way to go with.
I agree with this statement. I have some reasons for my opinion.   First, restaurant is a relax space for many people including me and those people may hate smoking. In fact, as far as I know, almost all of my friends feel unpleasantness, when other person smokes around them. As a result of this, there are nonsmoking seats in many restaurants. And people who donÅft smoke often take nonsmoking seats. Therefore, the cigarette smoke will start going from the restaurant of the hated person in which it can smoke to the restaurant that has stopped smoking even a little.  Second, it is too bad for everyone to smoke. If you smoke over and over, you would have illnesses such as lung cancer. In addition, it gives badly and smoking affects other people negatively. Other people breathe in secondhand smoke, and receive a more awful adverse effect from the person in question who is smoking the cigarette. This will not be a problem of the smoker himself alone.  Smoking the cigarette as understood from these damages not only I but even also other people. It is likely to become the customer's saving a little by stopping smoking in the restaurant digging into one's purse of smoking the cigarette moreover.   Anyway, it should make it to no smoking of smoking because it is not good.     
Recently, some local governments ban on smoking on street. Smokers are against this new regulation. But many no-smokers think that smokers should be prohibited smoking in any other public places. Especially, they should be forbidden to smoking in restaurant by regulations. I agree with this idea and I have three opinions about this topic. First, it is widely known, the cigarette smoke has many various harmful materials for example nicotine, carbon monoxide, tar and so on. It damages not only smokers but also people around them. This smoke gives more harm to children than adults. If you smoke around children, you look like to injure them lungs slowly by knife.Secondly, restaurant is place where many people enjoy dishes. But smoke has too bad smell. People in restaurant that filled by smoke can not relax and taste dishes correctly. All restaurant chefs donÅft want to enter smokers in them restaurant. Finally, according to some newspaper research, more than a one fourth smoker wants to give up smoking but can not. They also say that they will be able to give up if the rules of smoking changes stricter. Strict rules are chance for smokers to change them life style healthier.  
In these days, I heard an information of non-smoking area in Kobe is about to be enforced. The non-smoking area has been spreading all over the country. When I was in Hiroshima, that area has been enforced at main part of the city. These instances show us that public opinions are unlikely to be possible for smokers to smoke in public place. As far as I know, smoking has no good effects for the health of smokers their own and passive smokers. However, the right of choice what smoke or not belongs to smokers their own. There are not any laws that ban smoking. The restaurant is industry of the service. The service should provide for customers equally and fairly. From this point of view, the restaurant in Japan should not ban smoking completely. The fact of matter is that almost all of restaurantÅfs staff in Japan asks customers this sentence ÅgWhich do you want to sit, smoking or non-smoking?Åh and lead them to smoking seat or non-smoking seat. This is a good idea separate customers. The matter of smoking is solved by not only the restaurant but also smokers. So, smokerÅfs moral is responsible for the matter of smoking especially at public place. This is why the restaurant needs not ban smoking completely.    
I agree with this opinion, because smoking in the restaurant will cause a lot of problem. When people smoke in the restaurant, there will be a lot of smokes. A lot of people know that people who are smoking catch a lot of harms and some people donÅft know that people who inhale the smokes catch much more harms. Then if there are some people who are smoking in the restaurant, people around them must inhale smokes and they will catch a bad influence for their health. It is strange that people who live in good health get bad influence from people who are smoking. I also think that if there are some smokes in the restaurant, the air in there will be dirty. There are a lot of foods in the restaurant and if the air is dirty, the foods also will get dirty and have bad influence for the health. It is one of the important selling points for the restaurant to give fresh and clean foods for the guests. Not having that point and having smokes in the restaurant donÅft make the restaurant have a good reputation. Then smoking should not be permitted and banned at the Japanese restaurant. 
This year, Japan government has started the Taspo which is a card system to be intended to prevent under 20s from purchasing any cigarettes by vending machines. In most of the indoor places, except for the small smoking space, it is made all placs no smoking. There are many railroad companies which make the inside of the station concourse no smoking all day. Recently, it is that expanding people regard smoking as perfect evildoing. In this current, it is natural that smoking is prohibited at all the restaurants. It is to be well known and the smoking person begins the disease of the breathing system in several times compared with the person who doesn't. Also, if they are near the habitually smoking person, their risk to become a lung cancer with the passive smoking has become high. The persons who are too young to be permitted to smoke come to the restaurant. When trying to eat in together the persons who want to smoke and the persons who don't want to even if it divides smoking area and no smoking area, they might quarrel with eating in which area. The space where it is possible to smoke should not exist in the restaurants. 
Nowadays the movement which decrease the number of smoker is being done. For instance a lot of restaurants forbid smoking completely. Exactly in many case smokers are disliked. I donÅft have friends who smoke, but if my friends smoke in restaurant, I am very abhor. I dislike the smell of tobacco, especially the smell which stains the clothes. When I went to family restaurant with my friends before, a customer who sat the next table smoked all the time. We usually sit a nonsmoking seat, but at that time there were no seat except a seat in the smoking section. So we were no choice but sitting a seat in the smoking section. The people who want to sit the nonsmoking seat always wait their turn , because the number of nonsmoking seat is as same as that of the seat in the smoking section. If the number of the seat in the smoking section decrease or vanish, waiting time would be lessen. The customer who wants to smoke may get angry, but such people should put up with smoking when they are eating dinner. But if the restaurant which have only the seat in the smoking section , or smoking restaurant is built , a lot of smokers would come and become popular. 
Nowadays, every restaurant has smoking seats and nonsmoking seats in Japan. However, even when we sit on a nonsmoking seat, there is often the smell of tobacco from smoking seats. The smell makes people who dislike tobacco feel bad and they lost appetites. It seems that the freedom of smoking of a smoker should be accepted to some extent. However, restaurants are not where people enjoy smoking, but where people enjoy eating delicious dishes. Restaurants should be kept as the place where all people can enjoy dishes. Therefore smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. Smoking doesnÅft only make people feel bad with its smell, but also has a bad influence on others' health. They say that the smoke that a nonsmoker near a smoker absorbs has more harmful substances than that the smoker absorbs. Passive smoking is very bad for our body. Therefore, when you think about smoking, you will notice that where smoking is banned is increasing in Japan. For instance, we cannot smoke in trains, movie theaters or class rooms in the university. Therefore it is natural that smoking is banned at restaurants. Smoking is worse than useless. In Japan, these days, it is also difficult to buy tobacco because the price is becoming higher and higher, and the system of ÅgTaspoÅh has been enforced. I hope that the number of smokers decrease with such reasons. When restaurants become the place where smoking is banned, it will help decreasing the number further more. 
Recently, the situation of smoking have being changed everywhere in Japan. For instance some places have rules that prohibit walking people from smoking. Thus, it is important for us to increase or decrease situations of smoking. Generally, in Japan, people are banned to smoke in public places. Then, we need to consider about not public places, for instance restaurant. I donÅft agree with the opinion that forgives people to smoke in restaurant. First, there are many family and many children in restaurants. It is more dangerous for them to breath passive smoke than general smokers. Second, seats decrease. It is likely filled up on Saturday and Sunday, so we should remove smoking seats. Third, I donÅft like cigarette at all. A smell of cigarette is too bad for me, and the smoke is very harmful, so I dislike it. Most important thing I say is that smoking is very harmful for smokers and those around of the smoker. Smoking leads to lung cancer mainly and other disease. Lung cancer may leads to death, so smoking leads to death. Smoking has a harmful influence all people, so it must abolished in restaurant and other places not only public places. I do hope non-cigarette society soon.
Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I donÅft smoke. I donÅft like smoking. I hope I can deliciously eat every day. So, I donÅft want to go to the restaurants where some people smoke.   I have a horrible experience before. I went to the restaurant to have a lunch with my family. When I was eating my favorite dish hamburger steak, a man by our table got smoking. As the smoke came to me, I hated eating it. Because the taste of the hamburger stake mixed with smoke, I would like him to have stopped smoking.  Smoke is some bad effects on our taste and smell. And it is a great damage for nonsmoking people to breathe smoke.  Now in Japan, many restaurants and cafes have both smoking area and nonsmoking area. But there are a few restaurants and cafes that they have both smoking room and nonsmoking room. So smoking should be completely banned.  Japanese food is loved in the world. Many foreigners come to Japan every year. They have many meals at the restaurants in Japan. Japanese food is especially a delicate food. I hope they can deliciously eat Japanese food at the restaurants in Japan.  
I canÅft agree with what this author say. I believe that it is too doing. Smoking mustnÅft b e prohibited at all the restaurants in Japan. By making rules about smoking and keeping thes e rules strictly, other guests will be more pleasant. The making smoker defends it and the r ule is lightened and the damage of smoke will be able to be lightened. They make children no t to be breathed passive smoke, for instance. For another example, restaurants set up no smo king areas and smokers use these absolutely. So nonsmokers will donÅft have to breath smoke.  Still good other rules for the smokers and Iyakemuca exist. By the way, tabaccos contain ni cotine, tar, and others. Nicotine and tar give smokers pleasure, and smoking touch is seemed  to make smokers feel refreshed. Restaurants should make happy not only to nonsmokers, but a lso to smokers, because all guests basically have the rights that they are given good servic es by members in restaurants. It is possible for smokers to satisfy it only with smoking the  cigarette. If it is a little amount in exchange for observing the rule, it is necessary to  permit smoking. To conclude, I oppose the overall no smoking at a restaurant for the reasons  stated above.
I have a friend who usually smokes. But I dislike smoking. Some like smoking, others donÅftÅ@like it. Smoking affects health, but many people have smoked for long time. Now in Japan smoking is not banned at all the restaurants. Generally, restaurant is where people eat food. People who donÅft smoke should not allowed smoking at that place. I hared that after eating or drinking smoking is best. So for people who like smoking that place is best place, but for people who donÅft like smoking that place is worst place, because while they eat nice foods, they must smell smoking which they donÅft like. Even if smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants I n Japan, everyone doesnÅft have a trouble. People who like smoking only endure smoking. If they donÅft endure, they only go out of restaurant in order to smoking. Smoking banned happens things have merits and demerits. But merits clearly are larger than demerits. Then why government donÅft ban smoking at all the restaurants. People may donÅft react that. However I heard that smoking areas are gradually decreasing. Perhaps in near future smoking may be banned at all place, and smoking may be lost, and people may be can live a long life.   
I disagree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  The law doesn't ban smoking now, so people should have had the freedom to smoke yet.  However, it is also true that smoking is harmful to people's health, and the harm for people around a smoking people is bigger than that for him. And there are people who dislike being with smoking people. So (many restaurants already do it,) all the restaurants should separate the section which smokers use and which nonsmokers use.     My father smokes (, my family dislike it), and there are many smokers at the university. So I'm used to being with smoking people.  I don't know that smoking is related to the cancer, but I'm sure that smoking does harm to my health. Cigarettes are like drugs, it is hard to stop using them. And the price of cigarettes became higher.  So I will never smoke in the future. 
I donÅft agree to this opinion.    Smoking is harmful for people near smokers. Because, smoking causes sickness, for example, cancer etc. But, when we separate smoking place from other place, this problem is solved. So, I think it is not necessary that smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants. Recently, smoking place and not smoking place are shared. Now, sharing is done in many places. For example, stations, schools, restaurants, and office. Sharing has also been done in Kobe-University. I think this activity is very nice.    Furthermore, sharing is also done on pavements. In Kobe cityÅfs case, smoking is banned on pavement in Sannomiya and Motomachi. I think two reasons are. First, people walk on pavement in Sannomiya and Motomachi. If we smoke there, around people have trouble. In particular, people who donÅft like smoking get big inpatient. Second, cigarette butts make city very dirty. Kobe is a very beautiful city. This regulation is very nice to keep Kobe beautiful. In fact, Kobe is kept more beautiful than other cities.    But I donÅft smoke, when I smoke, I want not to give other people troubles. And I want to tell smokers that many people who donÅft like smoking are 
 I agree a little that smoking should be banned at restaurants, but I think it is too severe   for smoker. Surely, smoking is very trouble and unpleasant for non-smoker. I dislike it   too. However, if smoking is completely banned at all restaurants in Japan, it is hard for   smoker to eat outside. We should protect not only non-smoker but also smoker. So, I think   that we should use separation of smoking. I have watched a CM on television about paration   of smoking and then I thought it good idea. Smoker and non-smoker can talk or   eat in at the same table by separation of smoking. We can enjoy better life without   trouble about smoking in this way.    In addition, smoking influences human not only bad effects. Certainly, our health is   harmed by smoking but human who smoke can refresh. I think that why many people   smoke is this reason. We should look not only bad side but also good side. It is too severe   for smoker to treat them like as unpleasant one and we must know that we can remove   the wools between smoker and non-smoker by technology like separation of smoking.    So, I agree with a little with smoking should be banned.      
In my opinion, smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. But I think that restaurants which many children use should completely ban smoking. That is because smoking may have bad effects on them. Smoking is bad to health and may be the reason to cause cancers. People whose ages are under 20 must not smoke. But they may want to smoke when they see people smoking in the restaurants. Today more and more people stop smoking. So smoking should be banned in the restaurants for them to be comfortable. But, there also many people who always want to smoke. If all the restaurants ban smoking, they will be angry and not be comfortable. So in my opinion, there should be the restaurants which people can freely smoke, and only adults can use the restaurants. There should be the restaurants of two types. One type completely bans smoking and the other type completely permits smoking. Today, the view of smoking is changing. According to the newspaper, the number of smokers is decreasing. So I think some changes are needed in the restaurants. It is best that all people who are both smokers and not smokers are comfortable. I believe that my opinion will make it possible. 
I do not think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in Japan. I think that many adult men are smoke. I think that if smoking is completely banned at all the restaurant in Japan, people who smoke will be very angry.  I think that it is a good idea that tables of the restaurant in Japan are maked for people who smoke and for people who do not smoke. Because smoking is very bad for around people of a parson who smokes, I think that people who do not smoke will be very angry when around people smoking in the restaurant. I also feel bad if around people are smoking in the restaurant I do not like smoking. So I do not smoke. So I do not know feeling of people who smoke. I think that people who smoke will be very angry when people who smoke do not smoke for s few hours. In my home, only my father smokes. I feel bad when my father smoke at my next. My father started smoking when he is young. My father knowed that smoking is bad for health. But he started smoking. I think that I will not smoke in the future.    
I think smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  Because, there are many people who like smoking.  But, there are many people who hate smoking.  So, I think that we should completely separate smoking area from no smoking area.  I hate smoking.  Because smoke of cigarette cause lung cancer if we are near smoking people.  And I cough when I breathe smoke of cigarette.  Then again, smell of cigarette's smoke is bad.  So, I don't definitely want to eat near smoking people at all the restaurants in Japan.  Smoking people cause much problem, such as smoking while walking and throwing away cigarette, getting lung cancer for not smoking people, and so on.  When we eat at restaurant if I am near smoking people, I feel so bad, my clothes get smell of cigarette's smoke, and so on.  Therefore, I want to be disappeared cigarette from this world.  But, there are many smoking people.  So, I think that we should completely separate smoking area from no smoking area.  By doing this, smokin 
I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  In addition, I want that smoking should be banned at university.  I donÅft smoke, so I donÅft like smells of smoke. And I dislike that my clothes smell  like smoke. My mother hates smoke too. My father used to smoke before I born, but  she made him give up smoking. Because, smoke gives a bad influence to health.  Since I heard that, I made up my mind to never smoke. Smoke courses cancer.  Especially lung cancer, and more lots of cancer. If I smoke every day, I will die   due to cancer. But it can be avoided very easily, all of thing that I have to do is  never smoking. I have friends who smoke, and they say that smoking is very  comfortable, how about smoking little? But, I always remember my motherÅfs talk   and I reject. Sometimes I become to want to smoke, such a time I think that talk.  Smoking doesnÅft have a bad influence only smoking people. They influence others.  I think that smoking person will be bad is of course. But I canÅft allow that not   smoking person gets bad. I often see smoking people in university, and that smell  is very bad. And the smoke hurt my health. So, I think smoking should be completely   banned. 
I agree with that opinion. Because not only I hate smoking, but also the smoke damages lungs and it maybe cause cancer. Someone may say that they should separate smoking area and non-smoking area. It looks like the best idea for smoker and non-smoker, but I donÅft think so. To make non-smoking area in smoking area, some special machines or equipments are needed. Generally it costs a large amount of money. (As long as the owner seriously want to make non-smoking area.) It is true that the smell smoke might not reach the non-smoking area by those items, but we should know that all smokes spreads anywhere and all harmful smokes are not smell. Some research says that nicotine, one of the most harmful smoke in tobacco, doesnÅft smell and is invisible. So some invisible and non-smell smoke may invade non-smoking area so that there is no rule without the exception. By contrast, to ban smoking area and fill with non-smoking area, no special machine or equipment is needed. There only haves to be even a notice of no smoking. They only have to make a notice of no smoking. It costs quite few money. (Whether the owner seriously want to do so or not.) 
I agree with this statement. Because I don`t smoke the cigarette. And I hate the smell of smoking very much. I think that most Japanese don`t like smoking. The restaurant is a place we eat dishes. So smokers should not smoke there. Even if they smoke in the smoking place, people who are eating become unpleasant feelings only by seeing smoking of cigarette. I think people who want to smoke should smoke outside the restaurant, after they finish eating. In restaurant, there are many people, for example, baby, elderly person, sick person, pregnant woman, and so on. The cigarette may give them the serious damage. And if they smoke in restaurant, the poisonous substances enter the dish. And, when they keep eating it, it will surely harm the body. Smoking damages not only themselves but also others. Thinking this, they should not smoke in public place. If smoking was completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan, Most Japanese would eat more deliciously, and safety. My father also smoked several years ago. But he stopped smoking, because meal became no delicious. Around me, some friends started smoking recently. They said that meal became no delicious, after they had started smoking. So I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. 
I agree with this opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I have three reasons. The first reason is passive smoking. The space of restaurants is very close. So if someone smokes in the space, the smoke spreads very rapidly. The smoke is very harm to not only smoking people but also non-smoking people. Therefore, the human who has trouble in the lung are not glad to go to restaurant. But, if this rule applies to Japan, everyone can be entertained in all the restaurants. The second reason is that bad smell remains around objects. If someone smokes on the seat for a long time, the seat has bad smells. So these objects spoil for a very short time. The third reason is that Japan fall behind from the view that non-smoking rules. The foreign countries that are similar to Japan in power are non- smoking in public space, because the world health organization issued the non-smoking in the public space. So many countries are not permitted to smoke in restaurant. I think Japan should become non-smoking country, otherwise the impression of smoke in Japan become worse in the future. It is true that this rule is hard to accept for smoking people, but we have the effort to improve the national health.
I think that it is natural to prohibit from smoking in public placesÅ\res taurants, station and so on. To be honest, it is because I dislike others to s moke in the room. One reason, I hate a nasty smell of smoking. Even if only I  have the bad smell of smoking, I am tired of it. The smoke does health harm by  toxic chemicals in tobacco. Another reason, I think that some people are bad  mannered when they smoke. They seem to be careless about whether their smoke i s bothered other people. I think that they have to be more careful for others  around them, and moreover that they should keep off smoking the least at meals . It spoils delicious foods! Besides I think that they are bad mannered outdoo rs, for example, at the station and on the street. On the street they often se em to throw away cigarette butt. Although from the beginning it is banned to w alk with smoking, some people smoke, and throw it away. Thus smoking annoys ot her people, and there is no end to be bad mannered. So I think that they must  look back their smoking manner before they complain about ÅgNo smokingÅh.  
I disagree with this statement. I have heard a good idea about this problem.  This idea is called ÅgBun-enÅh. This idea is that completely separating nonsmokers and smokers. By this idea, nonsmokers donÅft absorb smoke and smokers can smoke.  But, this idea has a defect. Some people say that this idea is difficult to carry out so that nonsmokers might not smoke and that nonsmokers may absorb smoke. Of course, this is right. However, in many restaurants, we will not absorb smoke. Why? There are walls between nonsmokers and smokers in many restaurants. And in my opinion, smokers have rights to smoke. So we cannot easily ban smoking in all restaurants. But donÅft forget. Smoking is unhealthy for not only smokers but also nonsmokers, because nonsmokers absorb smoke which smokers make. So it is needless to say that smokers must not smoke if they are sitting in the restaurant which cannot completely separate nonsmokers and smokers.  Most important thing to do this idea is that everyone understand this idea and the defect of this idea and corporate. If there are no understanding, the restaurant owner cannot make walls. If smokers smoke in the restaurant which separate nonsmokers and smokers but nonsmokers can absorb smoke, some nonsmokers may say ÅgBecause we allow smokers to smoke restaurant, we absorb smoke. So smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants!!Åh.  In this way, everyone have to understand this idea and the defect. If they do this, all people will enjoy their lives. 
I agree this opinion. This is because, at first, smoking isnÅft good for our health. As we know well, smoking people can catch cancer of lung. Cancer is the most in the cause of death by disease. So, I think itÅfs better not to smoke. Secondary, like restaurant, smoking is annoying to me. Especially, the smog of cigarette ÅeÅfenter,, my body, and it damages my health.  For example, in my case, only being in the smoking section, the frequency of my coughing becomes pretty high!! And in bad case, I come to have a headache, so I canÅft sleep well at night. (and very sleepy at schoolÅc) In other words, including some same matters first reason, smoking damages not only people who are smoking, but also people who are around cigarettes, that is, none smoking people like me. So in the place which the window is closed, like restaurant, is easy to damage our body and health. Recently, what is called ÅeÅewalking cigarette,, is taken in the news program. It also hurts the health of children. So, I am for the opinion. And, I want people who smoke, to pay attention to others around them. 
I think smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants, or s hould I say that smokers cannot stop smoking at restaurants. They may stop c oming to restaurants because they cannon smoke! If a restaurant rejects peop le who love smoking, this lost must be large for the owners of the restauran t, although customers who hate smoking may come there more frequently. Now,  there are some systems to divide between smokers and nonsmokers. For example , some designate time to protect nonsmokers from smoke. We cannot smoke amon g the time. Others designate places for smokers and nonsmokers. Such systems  are enough to eat good food and make us comfortable. In fact, in a restaura nt where smokers and nonsmokers are completely mixed, I cannot stop coughing . However, when I have a lunch at a family restaurant, I do never conversely  worried smoke thanks to division.  Furthermore, now the technology to absor b smoke is developing. This may enable nonsmokers to eat lunch next to smoke rs comfortably in the future. Taking profit of restaurants into consideratio n, these steps are realistic and reasonable. If every people can have a good  time, we donÅft necessarily exclude smokers. We only need to invent good wa y to divide smokers and nonsmokers. 
Å@I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. Of course, I know that there are many people who smoke every day. However, I think it does not need that people smoke at restaurant. I will show you my opinions.    I do not smoke because I do not like the smell of cigarette. When I go for a meal with friends who smoke, I cannot smell and taste meals. I cannot stand the smell of cigarette. I want to eat delicious meals without the smell of cigarette. I do not smoke, so I cannot understand why people smoke at the table.   However, it does not mean that smoking should be completely banned at all space in the world. I do not smoke, but I admit that there are people who smoke. However I think there are many people who do not like the smell of cigarette. So, when they go to restaurants, I think they smoke outside the restaurants.    You may say that there are smoking seats and nonsmoking seats at many restaurants. However, both seats do not completely be separated. So, sometimes cigarette smoke flows to nonsmoking seats. Even though smoking seats and nonsmoking seats are separated at some restaurants, I think people who smoke should smell and taste meals without the smell of cigarette. I think it is bad manners to smoke at the table. Because, cooks want to make people happy by his cooking, they cook hard. We should appreciate his cooking.     I have heard that people who had smoked get fat as soon as they stopped smoking. It is because they can smell and taste meals more without the cigarette.   So, I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants.    
I agree with the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I want the government to make such a rule, because cigarette smoke makes us unpleasant.  First, smoke of a cigarette is a bad smell. No matter when I smell a cigarette smoke, I feel bad. If somebody else smoke near me when I eat the meal, I feel terrible. I hate it very much. I think that not only I but there must be many people who hate a smell of a cigarette smoke.  Second, the reason why we go to restaurant is to eat delicious food. However, if we are smoked a cigarette smoke from somebody else and our meal tastes bad, we feel terrible. If we feel the taste of our meal is bad, not only non-smoker but also cook feels bad. I think cooks make their dishes as hard as they can and they must want us to enjoy their meal. I donÅft think smokers have a right to prevent us from enjoying the meal.  Third, the smoke and the bad smell can drift everywhere in restaurant. We canÅft keep out them. Therefore I think all we can do to keep out the smoke and the bad smell is only to ban smoking completely at restaurant.  These are the reason why I agree with the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. 
I aÇç opposite to smoking at public places, particularly in a restaurant. In restaurant, we enjoy eating, but if there are people smoking next to us, we canÅft enjoy eating satisfactorily. As smoke smell strongly, a sweet smell of dish are denied. When I go to restaurant, every times waiters ask me ÅeÅf which do you choose Smoking seat or Non Smoking seat?Åh So, almost all times, I can choose seat which I want.  However, for the most part, this distinction is very vague. In other word, Smoking and Non Smoking seat are not separate from each other completely. For example, Smoking seat is located next to Non smoking seat, and smokes are carried from Smoking to Non Smoking. After all, I have to breathe in smoke going against my mind. What is more, smokes from cigarette, called Secondhand smoke, are much more poisonous than smokes that smoker breathes in, called Main current smoke.  Smoking imposes high risk on us. If we continued smoking, we become easy to get sick. Cancer, the apoplexy, and cardiac infarction, etc. are the examples. There is nothing by smoking, and we lost a lot of things. Therefore, if there are feelings that think about public health, the government should forbid smoking completely.      
 I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. There are some reasons for this.  First, the dishes would be bad by smoking. We should make a place that everyone can enjoy and eat deliciously.  Second, other customers may donÅft like and smoking will be bad for them.   But if smoking is completely banned, smokers will be offended. So I think it is good that they make smoking room. It is completely closed like toilet.   But I donÅft understand why they sell tobaccos. It is bad for health. Do they want to kill people? If all people come not to smoke, people who have disease would rapidly reduce.  So even if smokers were offended, we might have to ban smoking at all area of all the restaurants in Japan.  For these reasons, I think the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan is very good.  I wish tobacco were disappeared.  
I disagree with this statement. I donÅft smoke and IÅfm not going to smoke, so if smoking was completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan, I wouldnÅft be annoyed at all. But nowadays, smoking is banned in too many places. IÅfm a little bit sorry for smokers. In my high school, smoking gets to be completely banned at school when I was a student. Our teachers who smoke were complaining about it. There wasnÅft smoking area in the school. And even out of the building, smoking isnÅft allowed. They were smoking in the road in front of the school. I thought that itÅfs better to make smoking area in the school.  In Japan, the restaurants usually have smoking areas and non-smoking areas. But sometimes the wall between both areas is too small or thereÅfs no wall. Then the smoke easily comes from the smoking area to the non-smoking area. I wonder what the meaning of the existence of the non-smoking area is. That is foolish. A friend of mine hates smoke very much. And itÅfs true that smoke from tobacco is also bad for people who donÅft smoke. So if restaurants divide these areas, please let smoke stay at the smoking area. 
I agree with the following statement. I have three reasons why college students need a part-time job. One reason is that they should experience outside job and learn many things. For example when you work in Macdonald, you will experience got angry and praised  by your boss. And you will learn what you should do and what you shouldnÅft do. So you can develop yourself in the society. Next reason is that they want to earn money to play. Of course college students need much money to play with friends and buy clothes and  pay a house rent. If they donÅft earn money, their mother must spend money to save their live cost. So in order to support home spending money they should have part-time job. Third reason is that they need money for study. They can study many things in colleges while college students. They work harder and get money, and they stock money to buy books and go abroad and get qualification. This is why college students should have a part-time job. But I think balance is important. If they work a part-time job harder and harder and they can spend no time studying, I think there is no use having a part-time job. So college students should work a part-time job to think balance between study and work. 
 I think that it is important for college students to have a part time job. I have some reasons.  First, collage students have a lot of time. So they should use their time efficiently.  It is good that they use their free time to study, but I think to have a part time job is better. Because I think that it is good chance for them to learn earning money themselves. Most college students will have to work to live themselves after graduating their college. To have a part time job, they can get use to working in society. And they will have confidence.   Second, college students are about 20 years old. I think that they should independent from their parents. I think they donÅft need to earn all money to study at college, but they should not think that their parents always pay money for them. They should make an effort to earn money themselves. I think if they can earn money themselves, their parents will be happy and relieve. Because I think it is proof which they are members of society that they can earn money themselves.      From these reasons, it is good for college student to have a part time job. 
I agree to this opinion because college students have to learn the knowledge to live on their own. I think that having a part-time job is one of the best way to adapt to the adult society. Of course,it is important for college students to study hard at the college but I believe that this four years are very precious days for"marginal man." We can spend this time as we like. We are able to make time to study or work or play at will.When I was a high school student,my teacher told that he felt regret having played day after day when he was a college student. So,he taught me to study hard. Then,I decided that I try to study very hard but now I think that I have free time to do something except studying. Playing is joyful but only playing does not bring good changes.On the other hand,I really appreciate what my boss parents have done for me.Since I have started living alone, I always feel difficulties to live by myself.Therefore I think that I had better have a part-time job to help my parents and to get out into the world.Also working enable us to have a lot of friends and to discovery our unlimited possibilities.So I think having a part-time job is important for college students.
I think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. For a college student, the cost of living is one of the most serious matters. A student gets allowance from his parents may be able to live on it and be able to afford to spend it on social expenses. On the other hand, for a student canÅft receive allowance from his supporter, the income from a part-time job is the only support for the cost of living. In fact, he must spend his money on not only the cost of living but also study and social expenses, if he joins a club, it goes without saying that he will have to pay the club dues. If he has two or three part-time job, he might not be able to manage his campus life.  Moreover, a part-time job helps a student to prepare for his independence.  If he will have a part-time job, he can get common knowledge of this work and the sense of the value of money and he can experience human relations about this work. And then, he more kinds of task he will experience, the better these experiences help him.  When he is interviewed for jobs, these experiences will make him into attractive parson for interviewer.   Like these, a part-time job is brimful of advantage. 
 Did or will you have a part-time job when you are a college student? I think many people say ÅgYes.Åh IÅfm going to do something, too. By the way, what do you think about the question if it is important to have it? In my opinion, the answer is also ÅgYes.Åh There are three reasons.   First, working makes you more responsible. When you high school, junior high school students, if you donÅft something to do, you are only scold. However, if you are lazy to do your tasks in working place, your coworkers or boss must be damaged. You have an only choice to be responsible.   Second, to earn money for yourself makes you independent. It makes the people know how hard it is to earn money and how important money is. Therefore, you will think when and how spend the money more carefully than before. I think it is the first step to be independent. ItÅfs because to be independent is to do something for yourself, so It includes the case that you buy what you want by the money you earn.    Finally, the experience is useful when you work after graduation. Of course, having a part-time job is different from working for the company. However, you must be more responsible and independent if you have had a part-time job. The change in itself helps you. LetÅfs have a part-time job if youÅfre a college student.  
I agree with the idea that it is important for college students to have a part time job.  First, they should experience and know what working among adults is like before they graduate the college and start working as an official worker. Company offices are very different from schools because the former is the place to make benefits and the latter is the place to study and make friends. If they donÅft know the gap until they graduate the college, they will feel working adults are very cruel and will not be able to adjust the new environment smoothly.  Second, they should know the worth of money when they are students. They have much time to play and tend to spend their money wastefully. If they have a part time job and know how hard earning some money is, they consider the importance of money.  Last week I started a part time job. It was similar to the job of waitress who carry dishes, hosts and gives various services to the guests at a hotel in Osaka. This job was very hard. As I was a very beginner, I often made a mistake and got into troubles. However, I learned many things through the work and I am sure that the days I worked at the hotel are very valuable.  Therefore I think that having a part time job is good for college students and makes their life more enjoyable. 
I agree to the idea ÅgIt is important for college students to have a part time job.Åh I have some reasons to agree to this. First, I have part time jobs and if I didnÅft have part time jobs, I couldnÅft eat out, buy clothes, books and so on, join club activities, and even go to school. IÅfm not given any allowance from my parents so I have to work to get my lunch, train tickets, and happy memories. Second, I can learn important skills of communication, computer and desk works and establish relations to senior people by working before I become an adult. We cannot learn these skills through only school life. In addition, earning money for myself, I need manage my expense so I became more careful than before. Finally, I can feel a sense of achievement and fulfillment by working. When I get pay, and when I buy something on my own, I feel happy. I think that a part time job is necessary rather than important. Part time jobs will bring up me. 
I disagree with the opinion that it is important for university students to have a part time job. There are three reasons for this. First, they were admitted to their university not to have a part time job but to learn. Though this is an obvious fact, some of them devote themselves to work and donÅft study at all. They are too busy and tired to study. They also donÅft have enough time to study. I think they have forgotten the real purpose. Second, university students are given the best opportunity to become a cultured person and acquire some skills which will become useful in the future. If they hope, they can try everything, for example, going to English conversation schools and cooking schools, seeing movies, reading books, traveling abroad and so on. Luckily, there are special discounts for them when they do such activities. It is difficult for them to do such things after graduating from university and start to work. Third, it is important to join club activities. Many people who are the same level as you come to universities from all of Japan. They may give you a good stimulus more than ever, so you should become a friend with them. In order to make such friends, you should join club activities at university positively rather than have a part time job. For these reasons, I think university students shouldnÅft have a part time job and should do things they can do only now. 
 Is it important for university students to have a part-time job?  I think it very important and have three reasons for that. First, university students simply donÅft have enough money for study, clothes and club activities and so on. I am a scholarship student, so IÅfm not given money by my parents. But still I want to buy new clothes and accessories, to take part in club activities, and I also want to go to Korea for study in a couple of years. ThatÅfs why I work hard in a fast food shop. Second, I often think these days that I must be responsible for my action at working time. If I make a mistake to customers when selling products, I should say ÅgIÅfm sorryÅh as soon as I can because IÅfm a member of the shop stuffs. My rude action to customers may make the shop less popular. Moreover, I shouldnÅft be absent from job if I got cold because my absence makes other staffs busier. Thinking of them, I came to feel working is strict. Third, I found it very difficult and hard to work and make money by having a part-time job. I have it four times a week. To tell the truth, I think it hard to work after school. However, I canÅft come to live in luxury. When I knew that, I found how much my parents work hard to raise me and my little brother and how important I thank my parents. With these reasons, I think it important for university students raised by their parents to have a part-time job. 
ÅgIt is important for college students to have a part-time jobÅh, I agree to this opinion on the large. But it is according to circumstances, I think.  A lot of college students have some part-time jobs. Many of them will learn how difficult to earn and how difficult to get along well with other people. To have a part-time job is a direct experience of a social life. If they think that working is fun and they want to go even every day, or they need money, part-time job is wonderful for the students.  However, it has both good and bad points in the nature of things. I have a part-time job now. IÅfve been worked at the ceremonial hall as a wedding stuff since last month. Of course we are happy to help the customerÅfs marriage and we get a lot of money. But we get tired very much. To help a wedding ceremony, we go on working for more than 6hours without eating meals and going the toilet. We work until 10p.m. every weekend, sometimes until 1a.m. We have no time to do homework, club activities, and so on. I feel like quitting my job.   It is important for college students to study and to keep company with friends too. If a part-time job occupies most of their time so they canÅft do anything, they had better not have it. When college students decide to have a part-time job, they have to consider their time and strength.   In conclusion, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job as far as circumstances permit.  
I think itÅfs important for college students to have a part time job.  IÅfll show you three examples why itÅfs important.  First, we should have a social experience as many as possible when we are college students.  Because we have to work in society when we graduate from our school. If we have a part time job when we are college students, the experience will help us when we have an honest job.  Second, we can use money freely if we have a part time job.  But we will realize that money decreases soon.  So we can learn we should control our money.  Third, we will learn how we can get along with our boss and colleague.  I think itÅfs important for us to live in society.  Because human beings canÅft live alone in society.  ItÅfs true that we have to study very hard.  Because we are students.  So studying is the most important job college students have to do.  However, studying isnÅft all.  There are many things college students have to learn.  And we can learn some of them if we have a part time job.  So I agree with the idea part time job is important for college students. 
I think that it is important for college students to have a part time job.   There are two reasons.  First, we can learn importance of money and difficulty of earning money.  When I was high school student, having a part time job was banned. And I think that many of high schools are same. So, I have not had a part time job. Recently I started a  part time job at a Chinese noodle restaurant , I must do a lot of things. Cooking Chinese noodles, Chinese fired rice, Gyoza, fried chicken, washing dishes, and calling for orders.  My part time job is very hard, but I think that all part time jobs are hard. I found difficulty to learn money, and now I found importance of money.   Second, we can earn money by having a part time job. We became college student and we have free time longer than when we were junior high school student. So we need more money. For example, playing with friends, traveling, club activities. By having a part time job, we can earn money for such things. And we can make our campus life more massive .  So I think that it is important for college students to have a part time job. 
I disagree with this idea. The reason is three. First reason is that college students are busy in studying. Taking rest is important for college students. Second reason is that if college student get money by having a part time job, they play and do not study very much. Third reason is that the young who experience getting money easily may think that they can live on a part time job and lose will to study. Someone says that much money is needed to buy books. But college student can use library in university. Books rented in library are needed to come back to library. So we do not stop reading books which we rent in university. Another says that they shouldnÅft rely on their parents. But, I think that college studentÅfs parents hope their children concentrate on studying while they are scholar.  Another says that working experience is important for the young. But, in this society a part timer canÅft do important thing. College students are cheap worker for employer. What is important is not earning little money while they are college students but studying hard to earn big money in the future. So I think that the idea Ågit is important for college student to have a part time job. Å@      
I think that it is very important for college students including me to have a part time job. I have two reasons for this. First, through working, we can earn money. Of course, Money is not everything for our life, but if we have no money, we cannot live in this capitalistic society. My parents send me money every month, but it is too little to live. So, I work part time to earn my living. Working is very hard for me. I donÅft know the value of money until I start working. I think we need to know really moneyÅfs worth before grow up in order to live happy. Second, we can practice and experience the real world by having part time job. Most of us work for a company in the future. So, I think it is very helpful. I work at a restaurant two days at a week after school. There I study what kind of job each person does and how everyone communicates. I learn it is important to think myself and act immediately with having a responsibility. It is difficult to learn such things at school. Working part time is really widens my views.  Because of these reasons, I believe it is important for college students to have a part time job. It is very important for our life to study delightful, to work hard, and to play enough. 
I think this opinion is right and I have four reasons for it.  First, having a part-time job, college students can have good experiences that may be useful in the future. They can get wide experiences that can`t be experienced without doing a part-time job.  Second, it is said that they have a lot of free time. Compared with high school students, college students don`t have to study weak subjects. So, they have more time mentally. Moreover, they have less school lessons. So, they also have more time physically.  Third, because most of them are more than 17 years old, they can work for a variety of  jobs without age limits saying more than 17 years old.  Forth, they are always running short of money.  When they go shopping with their friends or eat out, they spend money. But the money they can spend during a month is limited. I think 3 hundred yen to 5 hundred yen without rent, electricity and so on is on average.  If they have a part-time job, they can get money and supplement(?) their shortage of money.  I have never do a part-time job, but I`d like to and must do it. Last month, I went shopping with my friends three times, so I`m running short of money now. I feel College students can`t live happily without part-time jobs except for the rich.   But, I think joining club activities and studying is also important for them. So working too much and not doing those is bad. It may be good to do things moderately. 
These days, many college students have some part-time job. I have a part-time job, too. So, many college students think that it is important for them to have a part-time job. College students need money to buy books, to buy grocery, to commute school and so on. I live in myself in Kobe. I can live enough with money which my parents send me, if I donÅft use money too much. But, I often short for money while my parents send me money, because I would like to buy clothes, CDs and so on. In fact, I donÅft need them really to live by myself. So, I have to earn money by myself.  The idea that college students have a part-time job has cons and pros. I think one of the advantages is that we can earn money to use freely. College students want to do many things. For example, shopping, trip, getting a driverÅfs license, and so on. But, often our parents are against us, and they donÅft give us money for those things which we want to do. We have to earn money by myself, and we can do that we want to do. On the other hand, there are some disadvantages. One of them is that we may be not able to have enough time to study. College studentsÅf task is studying. But if we work for too long time, we canÅft study enough. ItÅfs not good for college students, because we have many things to learn. We should learn to use time and money wisely. 
I agree with this suggestion. It is very good for us to work when we are university students. I have some reasons for that. First, we can earn money if we have part time jobs. This is a wonderful point of a part time job because our parents donÅft have to give us a lot of money. We are old enough to have a job. So we should work and help our parents. Moreover, we can know how hard to earn money is, and we realize the importance of money and the greatness of our parents. Second, we can spend time usefully. University students have a lot of time that we donÅft have to study. We can do anything in that time. But, it is very bad to spend that time only playing because we waste much money. What is more, we forget studying and miss passing the examination. We canÅft graduate from Kobe university. Third, we can have a good time to work with our elders. They know more things than us. If we work with them, we can get a lot of knowledge and know-how to live, work and win. We will be able to live comfortably in the future.  Having a part time job has a lot of good points! So I suggest to university students that they should work. 
I think that the part time job is very important for college students. There are two reasons for my opinion.  First, the experience of part time jobs helps them to learn the social custom or manner. If a college student work part time, he must have opportunities of meeting his employer, seniors, or customers. So, they naturally learn how to contact with people whose positions are higher his one. It is difficult to learn these things only in college because the relation between students contains little social responsibility. If they have no experience of part time job, they may take a lot of time to get accustomed to their new job. And they also are confused with the new relationship between an employer and an employee.  Second, part time job teach us what it is like to earn the money. People work, and they are given their pay. This simple relation is the base of life, and having some knowledge about this is necessary for young people, who will support the future society. And this lesson will make them think about their own job, and future. Nowadays, there are very a lot of people who make their living only with part time job, and this is fact that part time job produce some serious problems of modern society. But, even in this time, part time job give young generation very valuable experience and lesson to make a step forward the ÅgsocietyÅh. 
I think part time job is important to college students. There are two reasons why I think that. First, college students may have many free times. Because they have no needs to study hard like high school students. And, because they have no needs to work like adults. Of cause they have many choices to use their free time. They can use their free time to play with their friends, to go shopping, to study what they are interested in, and so on. That is important but donÅft forget that we will be adults and should make our lives by ourselves. Ordinary way to make our lives is to work. So before we need to work, we should experience many work. There are many work in our society, and we may not know so much about work. If we experienced part time job now, we might get many knowledge about some work. And that knowledge will help us when we need to determine our work. Second, part time job will give us many chances to get friends. Those friends are not only college students, but also adults, high school students, and so on. We can get many friends in part time job. As there two reasons, I think part time job is important for us, college students. 
Generally speaking, Japanese college students donÅft have much money. So it is necessary for them to prevent from spending useless money, and also to gain money. Therefore, I think that college students never go without a part time job.  Of course, the main object of going college is to study, learn, or master some academic things, called that get the knowledge  And a part time job robs students of much precious time to study. However, this fact cannot mean that college student shouldnÅft do a part time job, because, we never study or learn things without money. If you are willing to study something, what do you do at first? You may take pencils, books, table, and so on. Everything you need is not free!!  We should ÅgbuyÅh them. So we, college students need money.  But, I donÅft refer about the most important thing to study something. In my opinion, it is the heart of the students.  The students with wonderful hearts-sincerely, purely, smart, etc- can see many facts and understand the things more deeply. Then, how can we get such as wonderful heart? I think such the heart grows up in the human community. Judging from this point, a part time job doesnÅft prevent but help us studying.  Studying is not only reading the books and answering the quiz! Should we think what true meaning of a part time job and true knowledge is?  
I think itÅfs good for collage students to do part-time job. Because collage students have to work to live after they graduate from collage. I think they can get a lot of important things that they can learn from through to do part-time job and they notice this fact after they graduate from collage. And I think they have more free time than high school students, so they can do part-time job more easily than high school students. Moreover, if they do part-time job, they get more friends than if they donÅft because they meet people not only at collage or club activities but also at working place. IÅfm collage student now, but IÅfve never done part-time job. I want to begin to part-time job as soon as possible because I think if IÅfll have never done part-time job by the time I graduate from collage, I wonÅft be able to become well member of society. But I think if collage student does too much part-time job to study enough, he or she must stop doing part-time job. Of course, students must study. If one student quit studying, he or she is no longer student . ItÅfs stupid for students only to do part-time job and not to study at all. So student should do part-time job as long as it doesnÅft prevent student from studying because their main job is studying.  
Is it important for college students to have a part-time job? I really donÅft want to say itÅfs important, but most of the students will need to, so I agree. Happily, most of Japanese college students donÅft have to earn school expenses by themselves. What they need is the money to buy books, CDs and clothes or to enjoy their hobbies, so they donÅft have to work so many hours. I think that the thing which students have to precede the most is study. Some might say that it is important to gain social experiences. But we gain them whether we want to or not when we graduate from university. So if they donÅft need to have a part-time job, they donÅft have to. However, I donÅft think it is good for college students to be given pocket money monthly by their parents. Some high school students arenÅft allowed to have part-time job by their school rules, but there must be no university or college that forbids students to have part-time job. Of course there are some students who canÅft have part-time job because their study is too hard. In such case I think itÅfs ok to get pocket money. 
I agree this opinion. First, college students donÅft have so much money. They difficult to live with only money their parents sent to them because they need money for their club activity and so on. Second, a part time job offers them opportunity to learn manner or moral. For example, they can learn the way of speaking with customer or their boss. They can experience a lot of things they canÅft experience in college before they graduate from it. They can also make friends with someone who isnÅft their college including other generation people. I think expanding connection with people is important in our lives.  Third, I think they can use time better when they have a job than when they donÅft have it. When they only go to a college and donÅft have a job, they apt to think that they have much time but when they go to a college and have a job, they want to use their time efficiently. Having a part time job helps them take the balance in their lives.  They can also understand what to get money by working themselves is like. They can make ready to work in society by having a part time job. I think it is important for college students to have a part time job if they donÅft forget to study.      
I think it is basically good for college students to have part time job, but it isnÅft always important.  College students can learn many things through works in our society. At that point, to have part time job is good and students have good experiences.   It has, however, some bad aspects as well. First, after all, college students have to study. Having part time job, some students come to be so busy and tired and canÅft concentrate on classes. Secondly, they get money and may become to use them roughly. Moreover, having part time job, they tend to come home late. Their lifestyles become irregular, especially about students who live alone. There are some bad things like this. So college students donÅft have to have part time job. If they have clear aims and can overcome above considerations, for example, to save money in order to study abroad or to live by themselves in the case their parents canÅft give enough money, having part time job is important. Thus we canÅft always say that it is important for college students to have part time job. Students must consider whether they really need to have job, whether they can keep healthy lives, and why they want to have part time job.  
I agree to this opinion. I think it is important for us to have a part time job, too. I have three reasons for this idea.   Firstly, a part time job can help us with our independence. When we become college students, we gradually need to be independent of our parents not only mentally but also economically. I think a part time job is a first step of it. Secondly, when we do a part time job, we can experience many important things that we canÅft experience in our campus life. For example, we can learn manners, human relationships and the way of working, in the real world. We can have an opportunity to understand the mechanism of society. Finally, the experience of a part time job can be useful when we will get a job in the future. I think a part time job is also a practice of work. Therefore, I think a part time job is important for college students.  However, study is the most important for students. We should spend a lot of time in study. We shouldnÅft stop studying because of a part time job. It is important that we keep good balance of study and a part time job. I donÅft have a part time job now, because I am busy with study and club activity. I want to have a part time job when I will get used to my campus life. 
I think it is important for college student to have a part time job. I have two reasons.  First, we college students need money, when we join a club and enjoy with friends. However, I think that college students shouldnÅft take a lot of money from parents. We are not children. We shouldnÅft dependent on our parents too much, so I think we should earn money to enjoy with our friends. Second, I think that a part time job give me good experience. I work in a hotel, and I leaned etiquette and manners there. I think if I had not worked there, I couldnÅft have learned these things. Moreover, I think I can be patient. I sometimes feel angry to co-workers or customers, but I must to be patient. I was given money, so I need to be patient. I think that is work. This experience will help me when I work in a company after graduating from university.   However, we college student should not work too much, because the most important thing for college student is to study. Therefore, I think a part time job is important for college student, but we should do it as it doesnÅft interfere with study. 
I agree with this opinion. This is because I have three reasons. First, we can learn how to communicate with others. When we do a part time job, we see parsons who already work and various customers. They are various ages and have different backgrounds. We often see people of the almost same age at college, but we cannot see such people of various ages. We must make relations in that situation. Fortunately, we may be able to have patience through communications with customers.  Second, we can know the importance of money. We get money by our own work. This money is not given by our father or mother. We can know how hard we earn money. If we donÅft experience a part time job, we cannot know this really.  Third, we can learn how to use words. When we see a person, we have to choose words. For example, if the person is customer, we have to talk politely.  We can touch the real society a little when we do a part time job. Our world will spread. This new experiences which we have not ever experienced will stimulate us and we will develop. So, I agree with this opinion. 
    According to ÅgUriboÅh; this is an information book about Kobe University given us when entering ceremony was held, most of university students start a part time job before summer vacation. That is because once students get used to a life of university, they begin to find part time jobs. I think it is natural that students should start a part time job as soon as possible. It is important for them to have a part time job.      University students need much money. This is the most popular reason why we have to have a part time job.  First, we need money to study. We must pay tens of money for university a year and buy many expensive text books. Some students also must buy many books to write reports. Second, we need money to live. Many students live apart from their family. They must pay rent and charge of water, electricity and gas. Of course they must buy something to eat, too. Third, we need money to enjoy a life of university. We have much free time so we often join some club or circle. Or some travel abroad. Each of these costs much money.   Another reason is that university students should prepare to become one of members of society by experiencing variety jobs. Now we are students but not children. It is meaningful for us to know what working is like. And through working ourselves, we can know the worth of money. Experiences of a part time job will teach us many important things. 
I disagree to the opinion,"it is important for college students to have a part time job". Certainly, students can get knowledge of jobs or social manners and get some money through working. But in college life, there are a lot of things that they can do because of their position as a college student. For example, studying or to join volunteer works or club activities. Especially, it is bad for college students to neglect studies. I think the most important thing for them is studying.  In addition, they can work anytime after they will have graduated from school, so they don't have to work from now. It is a privilege of students that they don't have to work.  However, I don't mean that they must not have a part time job.  Of course, as they get used to their life, they probably want some money to play or buy things. But I have a worry that their part time jobs are so hard that they can't spend their time usefully. So I think if they can do that, there are no problems. From such reasons, I think, if anything, it's not important for college students to have a part time job, but it is not necessarily bad for students to have it. It's a use of their time that counts.
Although some people say that students should not work, I think that we, the students of universities should work for ourselves. The first reason is why we can spend the money we earn on something we really want to do. If we can save money we earn, we can go shopping, watch the movies and travel with friends or families. Particularly Traveling abroad in our vacation is very interesting because we canÅft have   much chance after entering the companies. Moreover, I think it is very important that we decide the aim like this for working and try working hard. When we have some aim, we can hope our life. Until now we have been given money from our parents even if we only go to the universities but some years later when we graduate from the university, we should work and eventually support them. So we should prepare for working after graduating the universities by experiencing as many jobs as we can.  I think various works as students shows us how to deal with difficult problem, and how to express ourselves in the working places.   This is the second reason.  Therefore I agree that students of the universities should work. 
I think it is important for college students to have a part time job. Firstly, this is because we can learn about many things through having a part time job. However I have never had a part time job and I donÅft know what having part time job is. But my friends do. One of my friend said ÅgI worked yesterday at Chinese restaurant. So, I have pain in my arm from carrying dishes. From working we can learn how difficult living alone is, how grateful for our parents working and what society is like. These things are not learned in college and we will not discover these if we donÅft have part time job.  Secondly, this is because we are able to find what we want to do in the future by having part time job. I think we can prepare becoming adult through going to college. I think we should be interested in many things to find a job that you want to do in the future. Having a part time job is a good chance to learn this.  Some college students have dream, some student donÅft. If you do, you can review your dream through doing many part time jobs or get chance to realize your dream. If you donÅft, you can find the job that you want to in the future by doing many part time jobs or the job that you donÅft want to. Therefore you may be able to set a goal from part time job.  From there, I think college student should do part time job if they can. But I also think they study hard in the college. If they canÅft study because of part time job, they may have to stop doing your part time job. 
 I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have two reasons about it.  First, college students need much money. At college, there are many events for college studentsÅ\club activities, welcome parties for new students, and playing with their friends, for example. It cost much money for students to attend these events. It may be impossible, especially for students living away from their parents, to attend all these events only with monthly allowance. And if there are unexpected expenses, material for their lesson, for example, they may not be able to pay money to it only with monthly allowance. So to get money, students had better have a part-time job.  Second, part-time jobs will be job training for students. They can trial many kinds of jobs by part-time jobs. So they can brush up their skill. And they can communicate with many people at a work place. So they can brush up their communication ability and learn social common knowledge.  Because of these opinions, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Part-time jobs are good for college students both economically and socially. ThatÅfs all. Thank you for your reading. 
I agree with this opinion. ItÅfs because it is a student, and it is a period to look at the world during a university student. Nowadays we say that the young donÅft know system of society. Therefore we have to look at the world during a university student. We are able to know system of society by looking at the world and to understand pleasure of working by a part time job. For example, a private supplementary schoolÅfs teacher is a good practice and experience for students who want to be a teacher. In other words, we are able to experience a good one for the oneÅfs future. Though we have to study because we are students, we have to know importance of working. The young who donÅft know this become NEET. Therefore doing a part time job during a university student reduces NEET. Japanese economy is very warning situation now. To reduce NEET is to save Japanese economy. We should know this for Japanese economyÅfs future. I work part-time now, and it is important to absorb various things from the society simply because it is a university student making future in the future. LetÅfs do a part time job and know society. 
I think it important college students do a part time job. InÅ@fact, I do a part time jobÅD The first reason I do a part time job is to earn moneyÅDWhen I enter the KobeÅ@university, I left my home. I live alone now. That needs much money. I think thatÅ@trouble my parents. And, I have a younger sister. So, I have to earn money as I can.  The second reason is being able to get to know new person in the place of a part time job. In fact, I make new other university friends in my work place. Seniors and regular members are very sensible people. I work in very good environment. Taking people is a good thing for me living alone. The third reason is doing a part time job is a good experience for me. A service trade isÅ@very hard. I studied an honorific and how to correspond. I think it good doing these works until enter the society. It is very hard to manage both of study and a part rime job successfully. But, it is not to become independent until a man can manage both of study and a part time job. A part time job is important in the point to train oneÅfs mind. That is why I think it important to do a part time job. 
   I agree with the idea that it is important for college students to do a part-time job. I have three reasons.   First, working now will be useful when we start to work in society. Through a part-time job, we can learn how to communicate with customers or our superiors. It may be difficult to acquire them soon, so now I think we should get used to them.   Second, it must make us feel how precious money is. If we ourselves didnÅft work, we couldnÅft know how hard it is to get money. But if we realize how precious money is, we must thank our parents.   Lastly, we can get more money if we work hard. When we become older and a regular employee in a company, we will have a little free time. But we are college students and now we have much time we can spend on what we want to do. We should do what we can do only now such as club activities or traveling abroad. Then they will become good memories and valuable experiences even if it costs a lot of money.   As I stated, doing a part-time job have many advantages and so I think we ought to do a part-time job.  
IÅfm in favor of the opinion that it is important for college students to do a part time job.  First, I think that it is a perfect chance to learn to fit into society. Anyone must become a working member of society when they graduate university. The world is not easy to live in. But they are not able to know the real world only at the university. They can get knowledge that is not acquired at the university only after they experience the world. Second, college students need money. Many students do club activity, and it costs money in many cases. For example, I belong to a mandolin club. I want to buy a mandolin only for myself. But it is very expensive. I canÅft ask my parents for money help. I must buy a mandolin with my own money. Furthermore, students have much free time. They often play with friends, and spend time for their hobby. It also costs money. Third, Many students lodge apart from their parents when they become college student. Some must earn money because they canÅft count on the money that their parents send them. College student is an adult, and they should become independent without dependingÅ@on parents. I think that schoolwork and a part time job are compatible.  For the reasons stated above, IÅfm in favor of the opinion that it is important for college students to do a part time job. 
I agree with this opinion. I have three reason for agreeing with it. First, College students use a lot of money. When we become a college student, we need more money than before because we come to have a large circle of acquaintances. But our parents do not always give us money.Å@So, we should do a part time job and get money. Moreover, we can understand the value of money.  Second, we can experience the world. If we become a working member of society as soon as we graduate from college, we will suffer great hardship. We can get used to being a working member of society.  Last, the experience of doing a part time job is very useful for the future. For example, if we do a part time job tutoring students, we can explain very well. You may say that we cannot study so much if we do a part time job. But we can become good at juggling our time. Furthermore, we always spend free time on study. So, I agree with this opinion that itÅfs important for college students to do a part time job and I am going to do a part time job as possible. 
I agree with this. I think that it is very important for courage students to do a part time job. I have two reasons for this.  Firstly, courage students should realize that it is very hard to do a job and earn money. Of course, courage students must study hard at university. But if they donÅft do a part time job, they donÅft realize that it is very hard to do a job and earn money. Whoever has got a job finds that it is so hard to do a job and earn money. Some people become melancholic or commit suicide because it is so hard to do a job. So if courage students donÅft do a part time job, they will feel it harder to do a job and earn money. Secondary, courage students need much money. High school students usually bring a box lunch, but courage students usually have lunch at dining room in university. They also go to drink with their friends. So they need so much money. In addition, some courage students live by theirselves. They must pay the rent and lighting and heating expenses. Their parents usually pay them, but it is important for them to pay them for theirselves.  So I think that courage students have to do a part time job. 
I agree with this idea. Doing a part-time job teaches us many important things.   First, you will appreciate the value of money. And you can lighten the burden on your parents by paying a cellular phone rate, a monthly fee and so on.   Second, you can learn manners and honorifics. These are important things to take as early as you can. And it will be very useful through your life. Moreover you will be able to get over your weak point. IÅfve been working part-time for a cram school since this spring. This is my first part-time job. My most important job is to communicate with students. But, IÅfm not good at speaking in front of many people or talking with strangers. I decided to overcome my shyness through experiences of this job. And now I can speak without being so nervous. Practice makes perfect! You should learn from failure now. When you get older, this proverb is not always true. ItÅfs now or never. Finally, doing a part-time job will give you chances to meet good fellow workers and ideal adults. In my workplace, about thirty college or graduate students are working. They are very kind and attractive. And they work efficiently. I respect them very much. We sometimes go to a movie theater, a restaurant and trip to communicate each other. We have a very good time. Through interaction with them I can learn manners. For these reason, I think itÅfs good thing for college students to do a part-time job. 
I think itÅfs important for college students to do a part-time job. There are some reasons I think. First, the part-time job is a good chance that college students can touch the society. In fact, it is the same for the member of the society and the person doing a part-time job to work and to earn money. And through the part-time job they will learn the importance of the relationship between persons and propriety. Because these are necessary if they have any work. I think such things are very important in being a member of society. I am working at the restaurant in Sannnomiya city four or five days in a week. IÅfm sure that I am learning such things. Second, by doing a part-time job, they will help their parents on the economic front. Because it costs considerable money to go to the university compared with the curriculum from an elementary school to a high school, there are many people who donÅft have room that pays school expenses. For such people, the income obtained by doing a part-time job will become some help. That is why I think itÅfs important for college student to do a part-time job.  
I agree with the opinion.  First, doing a part time job enables college students to learn something that they cannot learn at the university.  For example, how difficult working is, what the WORKING is, the importance of the money, rules of the society and so on.  Second, earning money helps college students to be independent from their parents.  College students are old enough to earn money.  So, they should help a family budget.  Because, they will have to keep their family budget, near in the future. Moreover that must be good experience to do the compatibility of part time jobs with studying to university students.    Of course, the first thing college students have to do is studying.  So there is a balance that should be kept between studying and working. And you may say "University students should spare their precious time to do what they can do only now, for example, studying harder or club activity and so on."  Of course, that is right.  But I think doing part time jobs is also what they can do only now. To do part time jobs helps them to choose their jobs in the future.  So I think it is important for college students to do a part time job. 
I agree with this opinion.  Firstly, a part-time job gives us various experiences. For example, we are able to get chances to communicate with many people from young to elderly persons. We can understand social systems. We will realize how important to have a responsibility to our jobs. I think these experiences can make our life better. We will not be able to get a chance to have these experiences in college. It is important for us to know how real world is going as well as to study economics, literature and agriculture and others.  Secondly, I think we should earn money to go to college on our own. We have to pay huge money in order to study at college. It is too hard to pay for this only by ourselves, but we should help our parents as much as we can. We have to never forget that they work hard for us everyday.  Lastly, taking a part-time job will help us to use our time productively. We are limited to use time to spend on recreations or leisure activities by taking a part-time job, but this also lets us not to spend our time meaninglessly.  For these three reasons, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.   Thank you.  
   To be sure we get tired of having a part-time job.We are not able to make ourselves at home if we have a part-time job.What is more we may neglect to study in a college.We would mistake the means for the end if we neglect to study in a college.   But I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.I have three reasons.   The first reason is that we are able to experience various things by having a part-time job.Those experiences are essential in our lifetime. Social experiences in a part-time job are useful to a full-time job.     The second reason is that we are able to earn a lot of money if we have a part-time job hard.By using a lot of money which we earned we are able to enjoy shopping and our hobby.Moreover we are able to get a sense of accomplishment.   The third reason is that we are able to make friends with people in workplace.It is important for us to make friends who are not only in a college but also in workplace.   This is why I agree with a college students' having a part-time job.So I actively want to have a part-time job.  
I agree with this statement. Part-time job is a good chance to experience the society for college students. There are many kinds of jobs we can try. All kinds of jobs will do something good for us in the future. Especially I think a job that we service to the customers, such as waiter, is important. This will help us to have an ability of good communication.     Part-time job is also easy to start. We only call to the shop and bring a document of ourselves. We have such an easy entrance test, but most of the time we donÅft fail, and then we can start to work. It is really simple.      Some people says college students should not do part-time job. They say StudentÅfs job is studying. I think this way of thinking is not wrong. However this could only say for high school students. College students are adults enough to think about themselves. We know what is good or bad, and what is efficiency or not.      In conclusion, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job, but only when we have a time to spare. Of course it is bad if we donÅft have time to study because we are too busy to work. How long and efficiency we work both are also important matters to think.
 I think it is not important for college students to have a part-time job because it is important for them to learn a specialized field. And they should spend longer time to understand it deeply. Making Money should be done after they graduate from the college.      Generally, itÅfs a difficult task that college students keep up both their school work and a part-time job. If they devote their college life to a part-time job, they will neglect their school work. The students who neglect it in their college life will be at a loss in the future. Of course, having a part-time job has the advantage of getting many opportunities to meet people from different fields. They also can experience many things by working. So, if they kept up both studies and a part-time job, they would live a full college life more.      To tell the truth, I donÅft have a part-time job now. So I have more free time than other students who are busy for their working. I often spent my spare time in going to the library in my college and reading the books which interest me. The books owned by the college are treasures for me because they are not seen in a usual book store or the library in my neighborhood. By reading them, I have been acquiring special knowledge little by little. I think this experience seems to be more valuable than one by working when IÅfm a college student. Once we start to work in the society after graduating from a college, we no longer have a long time for learning unknown things or interesting things. I think that spending as long time as we can to learn interesting fields is one of the most important college studentsÅf rights.    
 I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job, too. I have many reasons.  First, college students have much more time to use freely than junior high school students, high school students and adults who have jobs. So they can use time usefully by having a part-time job.  Second, they can get to know how difficult to earn money is and how important money is. Therefore they will be saving money. And they can deposit money.  Third, they can get many opportunities to be known various generations. And so they can have wide views. If they work at restaurant they can learn etiquette, if they work at cram school they can expose to children and their parents, so they can know the present state of education. This may be reference to decide their occupation.  Fourth, as they are near to adult or they are already adult, it is not good to depend on their parents for money. By having a part-time job they can live their own life. After they graduate from college this may be useful. Because the must live without help of their parents someday. For these reasons I think college students must have part-time jobs. 
Å@ Å@I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have a two reason for this. Å@First, they can know how to make money in society. If they donÅft have a part-time job, they get some money from their family. This situation isnÅft good. College students will work and make money after having graduated. Then, they should know to work. In addition, it is the burden on their family that they are given money by their family. Their family pays a lot of money for them. Ever they couldnÅft make money, but they can do now. They should earn money to use their selves. Å@Second, they can search their lifework or work in the place that they want to work. Especially, people who have a dream of working at specific place, such as a TV station, a company of news or company of creating animation should have a part-time job. It is important for them to have experience to work there, because they can actually know the real job, what to do and how to do. And people who donÅft think their lifework have a chance to think working or future. So I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. But I also consider that they should study well.        
I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Because the experience of a part-time job is helpful for oneÅfs life.   Most of college students have never worked at office. Some havenÅft had a part-time job. And after graduation from college, a major of college students gets a job. If they have never worked as a part-timer, you will be confused when you begin to work at your office or factory. It is like that a person who cannot swim is thrown into a pool. If he comes to be able to swim, it is all right. But if he cannot, he may die at the worst. So college students need to work as a part-timer to train for the time they have their job.   But a part of college students never get a job. Some remain to college for study. Others donÅft work because they can live without doing so. Whereas they also need to have a part-time job when they are college students. When we come to work, we can learn the feel of working people and feel grateful for them. We can become a considerate person by the working experience. And college students have the time comparably. That is why I think a part-time job is important for college students. 
Å@Å@Å@Å@I agree with this opinion. There are two reasons. Firstly, almost college students will become a working member of society. I think we can get the skill which we canÅft get by only study by having a part-time job. I have a part-time job now, and my boss said, Åeyou will get the skill which you can hit the mark which stops, but you will get the skill which you can hit the mark which moves by having a part-time job.Åf In short, I believe that we can get the skill which we need after becoming a working member of society by having a part-time job when we are college students. Secondly, we can find how difficult we earn money and how much trouble we have given my parents. I canÅft have ever thought seriously that the trouble my parents have seen, but I could find a little how much trouble my parents earned money and raised me. With it, I really felt thanks for my parents. I believe that I wouldnÅft think it now without having a part- time job. In conclusion, college students can experience many things by having a part-time job. Therefore, I believe that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.Å@Å@Å@Å@Å@Å@Å@
I agree in this opinion. At first, college is the place where we learn many kind of knowledge, but there are few chances to learn social rules. So a part-time job gives us opportunities to learn about society. We have to prepare for commonsense of society by graduating from school. If we know commonsense of society and have experience of job, we would be a social member smoothly. First impression is very important, so people who have experience of a part-time job give good image to his or her boss. His or her boss may think of him or her like having good ability of job.   Secondly, we learn human relations by having a part-time job. There are opportunities to do a job with person whom we donÅft like, but it is important to do job together.   Finally, we get money by having a part-time job. College student need money to play with friends, buy clothes and school expenses. To help with household economy is important and parents are pleased that their children earn money. Excess part-time job is not good because college studentÅfs job is study, but moderate part-time job gives us many experiences. So I think that to have a part-time job is important for college students.  
I think this opinion is right. There are three reasons for it.    Firstly because, when college students have a part-time job, they can experience various things that they could not experience at classes. For example, they exist at a convenience store not as customers but as clerks. So they will be able to think of things from a new way.    Secondly, it is important for college students to conscious earning money by themselves. Many of them did not have a part-time job when they were high school students. So they depend on their parents too much. They have to become independent from their parents in the near future, so they should have a part-time job and prepare for independence in their mind.    Finally, they can realize the importance of work in society. They should learn to be not consumers but producers. I think a part-time job is good text to learn the social system. For example, a part-time job at a horse racing stadium tells them that the horse racing is held by not only horse and jockey but also other many people. They should use the ÅetextÅf and learn society before graduate from college.    For these reason, I agree with this opinion.  
I really agree with this opinion. Maybe someone says itÅfs a waste of time for the students, but I never think so. Because I regard it not as a way of getting money but as a sight of the society. I also have a part time job, then I found some good points of it.  At first, itÅfs so important to do what weÅfve never done. The experience gives us new ideas. And I think young people can get more and better ideas from things. The dramatic change from receiver to server might give us some big discovery.  Second, in near future weÅfll have a work anyway, so it  becomes a good practice and a useful information for choosing a job. Take me for example, when I was a small childe I wanted to become a cook of cakes, then as I became a collage student I had a part time job of cake shop assistant. So I was glad (a part of) my dream came true, but in same time I knew the work is hard so much. And I though itÅfs just good for me to be an assistant of cook.  Third, working enable us to feel the relationship with the society keenly. When I was given a pay the first time in my life, I felt as if I was admitted from the society. And I realized I would soon become an adult.  As long as we donÅft neglect study that is our main job, we could get the thing what is more than the pay from a part time job. 
I agree with this statement. There are two reasons. First, I think that college students should earn money to buy something they want by themselves. Å@ Indeed, their parents spend much money for their food, clothes and lessons in college and so on. But, in fact they are enough to earn money by themselves. So, I think they should not depend on their parents very much. Å@Å@Å@Å@Moreover, they are able to understand importance of money and how difficult their parents work to earn money for them everyday through a part-time job. Second, experience of a part-time job shows them a lot of things. For example, they are able to learn how to communicate with other people such as their boss or customers. After they graduate from college, most of them must work in society. If they didnÅft experience a part-time job, they may be at a loss when they are in trouble in their company in the future. They are also responsible for their job and they come to think more that they should not be late than when they go to college to attend the class. A part-time job is useful in living in society and makes them grow. Therefore, I think it is important for them to have a part-time job.  
I agree with the following statement .  First , the college students will have to work to live  and be independent on their parents after the graduation ( though some of them wonÅft do so ), so it is good that they prepare for working and independence . One of the means of it is a part-time job . In short , they should have experiences of working .        Second , there are those who start to work after they graduate the high school , but on the other hand , the college student donÅft work . That isnÅft plain . You say that , however , the college students study hard , so they donÅft have to work . I think so . In these days , what they do are the club activity , shopping , playing karaoke , talking in the cafeteria , and playing other activities that donÅft bear fruit for society . I think most of them go to college because they donÅft want to work . Those who have profits are only themselves . They should work for society .  Third , in Japan , oho donÅft a child must work , but the college student donÅft work . Though they donÅft have to work , they should protect their principle .
It is important for college students to have a part-time job.   I disagree with this statement. Because I think it is more important for college students to study. Certainly, we have a lot of time we can spend freely when we are university students. So, it is natural for us to have a part-time job. We can get some money and buy something we want, for example, CDs, clothes, books, etc. There are a lot of things we want. And we can play our friends, go to movie and eat out. We can enjoy our campus life if we have a part-time job.  But we must not forget why we go to university. It is not easy for us to understand what we study in university. I feel that even our elementary classes, for example, physics or mathematics, are so difficult. Maybe I am not smart. But if we receive advanced classes, we must study much harder than now. So we need more time to study, read many books, think of them. Of course, we can pass through many examinations if we don't understand so much. We study so hard only a few days or a few weeks before them. And we can spend the rest of our time on a part-time job. But we should no do that. We should study as hard as possible everyday.                                                       
"Should college students work part-time? Of course I think they should do. There are four reasons.  First, a lot of students lodge at nearby college. So, they have to get money because surely their parents provide them with money, but in many cases, it is so minimum that practically students donÅft have enough money which they can use freely.  Second, in cases of students who go to school from their own house, they have to get money too. Because, there are many events in college, for example party, so expenses become large. And at their age, they become reluctant to ask their parents for money.  Third, social experience is important for students. They canÅft understand the real value of money until they get money themselves. If they understand it, they can know the importance of their parents who work hard to support them.  And, lastly, in many cases, human canÅft make the most of time when they have too enough time. They are in the habit of letting things they have to do wait. Students who study all day long are rare, and many students have their free time. If they work part-time, they get limited time and they can spend it on studying usefully.  Thus, working part-time has many important meanings. So students should work part-time, but the most important thing is the compatibility of work with study. And they must not forget this----studentsÅf main business is, of course, study!!  " 
"I think it is important for college students to have apart-time job   if it doesnÅft obstruct study.   Firstly, what we learned or what we experienced practically will be   surely useful. We can learn the manner and the courtesy in a   workplace. This will be very benefit to the time when we work in an   office in the future. In a workplace there are many things that are   different from those we have ever known. So I feel it good to   experience actually those things before we start to work.   Secondly, I think we should do a variety of things during the   student. If we graduate the college, we canÅft afford to do what   we want to do. With such reason, only now there are times when it is   possible to do favorite things and do many kinds of jobs. And an   experience in part-time job might influence which jobs we choose in   the future.   Thirdly, we need to think of our parentsÅf burden. Our parents   spend a lot of money on our education, so we ought to use money we   earned by ourselves for our hobby such as a trip abroad. And we can   know how we should manage money. In addition, it is said that it is   not until we begin to earn that we know a value of money." 
"I agree this idea. To have a job is to citizen's duty.  I have a part-ti me job as a teacher at a cramming school now. I was taught manner by oth er teachers before I started working. This experience is useful for my d aily life and future. To make relationship with my students who I don't  know anything is also valuable.Å@When I think what I do to be believed b y my students, I think of myself objectively. So I can find my good and  bad points, and think what I do to be a good person.  Thus, to have a pa rt-time job is not only the way to get money but also precious experienc e. We can meet and help many people.  I found it difficult to get money. So I make much of money better than  before to start working. I save the money for my future. I'm making effo rts to get money for my purpose that I will live in Kobe. It is also imp ortant to make efforts for a purpose. I also want to thank to my parents for working for my family, because I  knew the difficulty to get money. Since these reason, I agree that the c ollege students have a part-time job.  " 
"I agree with this opinion. There are two reasons I think so.    First, I think that it must be a very good experience for college students to have a part-time job. Most students will begin to work after they graduate from college. Then the experiences which they have gained by working part-time must help them to work smoothly. They can learn how to do - for example, how to treat customers, how to manage, how to cook or how to get a job through part-time jobs. In fact, I am going to have a part time job from June in order to experience many things.  Second, college students get money by having a part-time job. It is important for them to make money because some students live alone in order to go to college. They have to earn their living by themselves. So to have a part-time job is also what they have to do. If they have a part-time job at restaurant they might be able to eat lunch or dinner for free or on the cheep. But to have a part-time job includes a problem. The problem is that students might become too busy to study. This is a very serious problem because students go to college in order to study.  It is necessary for them to make the best of their limited time.      " 
"I agree with this statement because of the following reasons.    One of the reasons for having a part-time job is that we need some money. If we enter the college, we will have a lot of free time. However, it is wasteful to do nothing. So, we should use our free time to study, enjoy circle activities and our hobbies and so on. And if we enjoy such activities, we need some money. Thus, I agree with having a part-time job.   Another reason for having a part-time job is that we can acquire some knowledge for job. When we choose a part-time job, we think to choose a good one for us. For example, are we paid high salaries? Is the position of working place near our college or home? Through these thinking, we can understand the standard level of labor conditions. And when we do a part-time job, we can get good experiences. For instance, we will acquire a good manner to be impolite to customers, and we can have a relationship with the employees like us and exchange information about job and so on. Thus, we can have a social study. And so, I agree with having a part-time job. " 
"Å@I agree with the idea that college students should have a part-time job. There are several reasons. Å@First, college students need some money, for example having lunch or eating dinner with friends. Although studying is the most important thing for college students, having a good time with friends is also important. Students enjoy playing with their friends everyday. Å@Second, a part-time job brings up college students. By working, college students learn social skill, manner, and common sense. A few years later, all the students will be required such things. College students must practice by working as part-time worker. Å@Third, a part-time job is the important chance to make friends. In fact, my coworkers and I are good friends. Talking with the seniors is very interesting. I enjoy part-time job with them. Å@Fourth, college students should know the importance of the money. No man wastes the money that he earns. To learn the use of the money is very important. Å@Thus, I think that college students should have a part-time job. A part-time job needs a lot of time, but that is never futile. There are some people who don't have a part-time job. If they start working, they surely grow up in various aspects." 
"I agree with this idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are two reasons for me to agree it.  First, college students need much money because we have to buy expensive text books, clothes, food, and so on. We cannot cover these expenses with only remittance from our parents. Moreover if we travel abroad, we will need much money. But it is not good to ask our parents to pay travelling expenses.  I have lived alone since this April, and I realize that I do not have enough money to enjoy myself. Recently, I swear not to buy sweets because they are very expensive, although I like sweets very much. Without money, I can buy nothing.  So we should have a part-time job to get money.  Second, we can learn a lot of thing from a part-time job. For example, we can learn human relationships in society and we can really realize how hard work is. We can develop as a person through a part-time job.   Now, I work at a bread shop as a part-time clerk. And there, I could become acquaintance with various generations and I could learn manners in society and importance of responsibility. I think I could become mature person than before.   From these points of view, I think that a part-time job is very important for college students.    " 
"I agree with this opinion. This is because that I think people  can learn a lot of things that they cannot learn just at the university  if they have a part-time job. There are many kinds of things that they  can learn at the university, but I think there are also many another  kinds of things that they cannot learn there.        Now I donÅft have a part-time job, but I want to do some. The  reason why is not only to earn some money by myself, but also to be  helpful for someone. I believe that the experience of having a  part-time job will enrich the peopleÅfs life later. To have some  part-time job, they meet many people in various situations, so they can  have a chance to communicate with people in another generation and  touch various way of thinking and living of the people. I think they  also can get some information of how to live well in the world through  working some part-time job.        In other words, to have a part-time job is a kind of preparation  for their future, I think. Therefore, I agree with the opinion that it  is important for college students to have a part-time job. " 
"I agree to this opinion. Some people say that college students have to study more if they have a time to do a part-time job. Of course, it is true that there are some students who remain in the same grade by playing all the time with their earned money. However, there are three reasons for my opinion. First, having a part-time job tells them a real society. Most college students have had little time to enter in a society. By working, they have a chance to know how to communicate with customers, how to speak formally, and so on. That is a very valuable experience. Second, they know the importance of money. They have been brought up preciously by their family, and use their allowance freely. So, they must know how hard earn money by working themselves. They would thank for their parents to raise them until now. Finally, they can challenge various things. Although college students have much free time, most of them canÅft do what they want to because they donÅft have enough money. By getting a lot of money, for example, they can watch a baseball game, go abroad to see a different world, and so on. They could enjoy their college life very much. Therefore, college students should do a part-time job. That is useful for their future." 
"Å@I agree with the statement. I think college students should have a part-time job. First, it is true that a part-time job prevents us from studying, but from part-time job we can learn much more about society, economy, and how people feel when they communicate with stranger that we never learn at school nor club activities. For example, it is very difficult for staffs to satisfy customers while they may take it for granted to be dealt with kindly at a fast food restaurant. Employees have to act with responsibility during working, which skill is not gained so quickly. But in order to be an adult making society better, we have to be at least responsible for anything about ourselves.  Second, we can have wonderful friends by having a part-time job. In fact I started a part-time job at a fast food restaurant this spring. During the job we have to speak gently, make smile and do tasks speedy and accurately. After the job I am always hungry and exhausted. Nevertheless the reason I want to continue this job is the members of stuff. They encourage me, and make me feel to be like them. They are very important for me to get over the hard jobs.  We will get out into the world after graduating Kobe University and have to take some actions in order to make the world equally more peaceful. In another words, we need to know widely about this society and this world. A part-time job is a good method for us, college students." 
"I agree with this idea. Before you start to work, you can get some roles as a member of society by having a part-time job. For example, if you work at a restaurant as a hall staff, you have to communicate with others who are various from baby to elderly people. By repeating it, you would be good at talk to other people. It is a great benefit and would be one of your advantages. You would be able to get along with your bosses in your office. When you think part-time job in that way, the experience of it will be your forever treasure. At the same time, you do not have to depend on your parents in terms of money by making money in yourself. However to make money in yourself does not lead to get independent of your parents. You should rely on them in some respects. For example when a trouble you can not deal with happens, you will ask them for help. College students depend on parents in many respects, but you should manage to deal with many problems little by little. Once you are twenty years old, you have to depend on yourself. So you should get ready for your independence from now. The first step is part-time job as I state it that way.  " 
"I agree with this idea. I think that college students donÅftÅ@have much money they can use as they like. They must earn money for life unless their parents feed them. So,for some students,there may not be a room to choose if they should have a part-time job or not. Anyway,it will be a good experience to have a job outside their college. They can learn many things,and parhaps have a different view toward society. they can also feel confidence to finish the work and get money by theirselves. I think we should experience many jobs and meet many people there. Though I have written these things,I have never had any part-time jobs. The reoson is that I'm busy now preparing the festival called `Nada Challenge"" held at newt month. But after that festival,I'm going to have some part-time job. I'm looking foward to finding good jobs and people. I feel it is important to spend a limited time wisely, especially for college students.  We should remember one thing;studying is the most important thing. We must not spend too much time working. If we do so,we will lose our grade. On condition that we can manage our time and life,I think it's good and important for college students to have a part-time job.That'all. Thanks for reading my poor English. " 
"I think that it is important for college student to have a part-time job. There are 3 reasons for that.  First, they can earn money to enjoy their campus lives.  Almost all the college students want to enjoy their campus life. But, without money, they couldnÅft enjoy happy things such as going to the theater, traveling abroad, doing outdoor activity and so on. What is worse, without money, they couldnÅft continue cultural life as a human being! (having meals, washing clothes and so on)  They also lose chances to experience various kinds of things which will benefit them when they become members of society. For example, a man who traveled abroad in his school days can easily make friends with people who come to Japan for business.   Second, they can experience many jobs.   A part-time job usually requires less responsibility than a full-time job. So, college students can go to various kinds of business communities and learn introduction to various kinds of jobs. In other words, they can acquire many skills with less responsibility in their school days. Through experiencing various jobs, they may find a suitable job. And if they the job, they can find new jobs thanks to the skills acquired in their school days!  Third, they can learn the systems of society. For example, they can learn how money circulates or how to make good connection with people. These knowledge will be very useful when they become members of society. " 
I agree with an opinion that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Because I think it is necessary for college students to make money they need for living and they can use freely. They study what they want to do as an adult by themselves, so they cannot put their families under a burden financially. And I think it is also necessary for them because a part-time job is good experience to work in the society. They do not know what is working in the society, so having a part-time job is a very good opportunity for them to know working in the society. I think a part-time job is important for college students to make human relations. If college students do not have a part-time job, they cannot make human relations other than in their colleges. Making human relations is also important for them when they work in the society, and the people whom they met in a part-time job may become important in their lives. I think that a part-time job is important for college students to make money, but there is really important purpose in the future when they work in the society. So I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.      
"I agree with college students having a part-time job. I have the two reasons. The first reason is that we need money to have a pleasant campus life. We want to play with our friends, for example we want to go to amusement parks and go on a trip, and do what we can do only now, and for example we get a driver license and of course for studying buy books or something to study. To do them, we have to spend money. The second reason is that we can get a lot of experiences from a part-time job. Because I do a part-time job, I am learning how hard working is, manners as a worker and importance of money. So before we graduate from university and work, we have to practice working and get experiences through doing a part-time job. Of course we should not be lazy of studying by doing a part-time job too much time. But most college students, including me, understand studying is more important than doing a part-time job. So only if we are not crazy about doing a part-time job, we can get good effects, experiences and of course money. So I agree with college students having a part-time job. " 
"I agree with that statement. First, I think college students including me have at least one or two ambitions that they can do only when they are in college. For example, traveling around the world in long vacation, buying clothes or car, etc. To do that, they must have a lot of money. I think it is not bad for college students to have a part-time job to get money. Second, for the college students whose school is far from their parentsÅf house and who lives alone near the school, all things costs them directly. If their parents have a lot of money and give them easily, they don Åft have to have a part-time job. But if their parents have not so much money, they have to have a part-time job to get money to buy food, textbook, etc. Of course, I disagree to have part-time job that make college students not to study satisfactorily. At least they are college students, their studying costs their parents or them. They have to study hard and they have to get good work. According to these reasons, I think it is important for college students to have s part-time job, and I agree with that statement. " 
I agree with the statement. There are some reasons. For the first reason, college students need money to enjoy their campus life. They want to play with friends, buy their favorite clothes, and take part in parties. Some people who live alone near the college need also a lot of money to live. To do such things, they need money. Before entering the college, most students were given money by their parents, but some day they must be independent from their parents. So, they must know the difficulty of getting money. Of course, students canÅft make all money for their life, but I think that they have to get at least enough money to satisfy their desire and help their parents. For the second, they can meet many people to have a part-time job and get different knowledge which they couldnÅft get ever. There are many kinds of part-time jobs, and there are various people at the working place. Some are from very far place, and others are very older or younger than them. As working with such people, they can learn many things. And the experience of part-time jobs may be useful for them after entering society. For these reasons, I think that college students need to have a part-time job.  
"I think that it  is important for college students to have a part-time job. We should  experience a lot as social study when we are students. Especially,communication skills  needed by the social of  future are important for us. Communicating with various people through part-time job must acquire these skills and other many important things. For instance,we can acquire cooking skill when working in restaurant,skill of explaining things well  when working as a cram school teacher,and communicating skill in English working in a shop where foreigner often come like my friend. She said that she is glad to use English skill she acquire  as a member of society. And my friend said that he had never understood importance of working and importance of his parents until he bigan to work as a part-time job. I thought so,too. Then,I think that there are some students who must work to make money for the costs of study in school and the cost of living like I.  For example, their family is not wealthy,but they hope to study in university. They have to make money using the scholarship. So,I think a part-time job teaches us not being able to learn at university  but important things  working is important for college students. " 
"I agree with the first statement. Before entering collages, almost all of us entirely depend on our parents for not only money but also minds. First point is our mind. We think our parents will help us if we are in trouble. But, when we are working part-time job, we have to think by ourselves, and decide what to do. Indeed our coworkers often help us, but sometimes we have some occasions to find our way out of the troubles. We can realize many important things through these experiences. For example, we will realize that we have to become independent step by step.  Second is money. Our parents buy all things we need, and we tend to think it is natural that parents give us money, until we earn by ourselves. But if we start working part-time job, we can understand how difficult it is to earn money. We have to work hard in order to make enough money to buy what we want, even if its price is much lower than the amount of money which our parents give us. We will be able to thank our parents through this experience.  However, we are college students. The most important our duty is study. We should not work so hard that we cannot study. We must remember this when we work. " 
"I agree with this statement, and there are some reasons. First of all, many college students need some money to enjoy their school life. Not only playing with their friends but also paying tuition fee. Second, when we become college students, it is the time to get ready to become an adult. And I think that part-time job plays an important role in that step. Through this activity, we learn many important things. For example, attitude, manner, responsibility, and so on. Of course it also tells us the difficulty of earning money. And they are all necessary to become a member of the whole world. Also this means that children become independent from their parents. Of course, I have part-time job, and I feel that I could grow up through this job. Finally, if college students donÅft have part-time job, there are too much time left. Someone may say that they can study many things because they have much time. But, I donÅft think so. Of course some students do so. But most of them may just play with their friend whole time. And soon, life style gets worse and worse. Because of these factors, I agree with the importance of part-time job for college students. And I think it is more important to try many kinds of part-time job." 
"I agree with this statement, and I actually do a part-time job after my classes. I think it necessary to do a part-time job.   First, we learn many things in working. I think that the part-time job is a chance of learning to fit into society. College students will become a member of society in the near future, so it is very important for us to learn the society. The most important thing I have learned is that many kinds of people live in the world and I have to broaden my outlook.  Besides, college student is a grown-up, though he studies in university. So we have to take care of ourselves little by little. When I began to do a part-time job, I know for the first time the difficulty of earning my living. And I realized how much I owe my parents.  Moreover, college students need money to enjoy their campus life. We have a lot of time to spare in our school days. So we often want to enjoy traveling with our friends. We also want to enjoy our hobby. In either case, we need a lot of money. So we have to keep on working to earn more.   Therefore, I think it important for college students to have a part-time job. " 
"I think that working part-time too much is not good for students.   Firstly, studentsÅf main occupation is more studying or learning expert knowledge.  Working part-time too much interfere with their studying. A friend of mine who entered at KOBE UNIBERSITY with me doesnÅft come to school lately. She hadnÅft been absent from school or late for first morning class before she started to work part-time. She started it last summer holiday and finally she failed many test in the second semester.  She said that her part-time job was very busy and worked until the night, and she canÅft wake up in the next morning. ..What did she enter the university for?  But I also think that working is important for students to learn system, rules and manners of society. Before we start to work for a company, we should learn many necessities for working in society. In case we fall down in our office, we need to practice by working part-time during we are students. And If we work, maybe we can get pleasure of contributing toward society.  So, what is the most important things is to balance work part-time with study in the university. If we work moderately and study hard in the university, if we can achieve to balance the two occupations, surely we, students can spend fuller our time.  " 
"I also think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  There are two reasons I think so.  First of all, they are able to learn the difficulty of working as a member of society.  There are a lot of kinds of people in office, and they have to get along well with their colleague even if they were people that they dislike.  For example, in university, they do not have to have the relation with people that they do not like.  However, in office, they have to have good relation with people they do not like.  Through part-time job, they learn the difficulty and the importance of getting along well with people.  Moreover, they experience a lot of things that will be useful in the future.  Second, they clearly learn the importance of money.  To do a part-time job is so hard that they sharply learn the value of money that they get by working.  The experience of doing a part-time job tells them the importance of money.  In addition, they appreciate their parents who grow them up.  WhatÅfs more, the experience develops their ability of various fields.  For these two reasons, I agree with him that college students should do a part-time job.  " 
"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  Of course for college students, study is the most important in school days and it is not permitted part-time jobs to prevent students from studying. But I suspect that part-time job is also one of study.   I have heard from my mother following thing. ÅgA student who has had some part-time job is more useful in the work place than a student who hasnÅftÅh. I really agree to this.     If they are going to get a job and work in society after graduation from university, I think a part-time job is good method as a preparation of becoming a working member. Because they can learn a feel of the work place, human relations, and manners in the business, and so on, if they have a part-time job.  And these are surely helpful to actual work place. A student who knows only study isnÅft needed from society.    Then, speaking of salary which most of college students focus on, needless to say, college students need money but they have only a little money, moreover they are able to understand the importance of money by working and earning money themselves.    ThatÅfs because, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.    " 
"I think that part-time job is important for college students, and for the following reason. First, by working with many other people, we can acquaint ourselves with them. Making many friends is very important in our lives. Second, we experience new environment that we have not known,Å@so we can learn many important things. For example a social rules such as a greeting, responsibility, and attitude. They are essential for college students to go out into the public society. But it is very difficult to learn social rules. We may mistake many time at part-time job. We may be got angry. Through these bitter experiences, we surely become adult. So I think we need some mistakes at the part-time job. In public society, it is too late for us to make a mistake. Part-time job is first step to go into the society. Third, we can earn money on our own. I think most of college students work because of this third reason not first or second reason. College students have much free time. Using their time for them is efficient. For these reasons, I think part-time job is necessary, so I agree with that college students do part-time job.  " 
"I think that college students should have a part time job. There are three reasons for this. Firstly, we can learn what I cannot learn in a college. For example, it is how to cook and a good manner for customers. I worked at Fugetu Kazenomati .Fugetu is okonomiyaki shop. I worked for eight months and learned how to use kitchen knife, how to cook okonomiyaki, yakisoba, tonpei etc and basic knowledge of cooking. I began to live in Kobe this year. In fact, the experience I got by a part time job is very useful for my single life. Secondly, money is necessary for a college student. There are many events in college days. For example, it is trips, parties etc. these events need much money. In fact, I will go abroad this summer. Of course, there are scholarship and money of my parents. But I want to spend money that I earned as much as possible. Finally, we meet many people at a part time job. For example, it is members of the job and customers. Now I work a part time job at a sport club. The sport club has many members. I often talk with them. It is very fun and interesting for me. Of course, we should study hard in a university. But, for these reason I agree with this opinion.   " 
" I disagree with this statement. I think part-time job is not so necessary for college students.   The first reason is that what is more important for college students is to study. However, most of the students around me donÅft study very hard. I think part-time job is one of its reasons. Some of my friends work very hard at night and they canÅft get up early in the next morning to go to school. That is not good. It is nice idea to work moderately when we are free and nothing to do, but overwork is not good for our school life and the health, too.  The second reason is that we can have a job anytime in our life, so we donÅft have to do it when we are college students. I think there are something that we can do only nowÅ\to make many friends and play with them, to join club activity or circle activity, to travel abroad and go to many places in the world, and so on. These are difficult to do after we graduate from college and have a job or get married, and once we begin a job, we must work every day and canÅft do these easily. We should think what we can do and what to do now, and enjoy our school life.  " 
"I agree with it. There are three reasons. First, we can have good social experience before we join society. Second, we can get money for studying, living and enjoying a college life. Third, we canÅft have such an experience only when we are college students.  For example, I work for a bakery now. I can study right talking, in Japanese we call it keigo. If I didnÅft work for this shop, I would not be able to talk it. Then, I live oneself. So, I buy many things, food, clothes and books etc by money which I get from part-time job. I practice living oneself  in the future. By working there, I can meet many people, and I can spend good time with them. And, I can know many things which I donÅft know. For example, bakery wokers call packing bread ÅgsoccerÅh.  I have worked for juku. I taught junior high school students English. They studied very hard. When I saw them, I wanted to teach them many things, and I studied very hard too. When I leave there, because I would be moving, I was very sad because I missed them. This is my good memory.  In this way, I have good experience by part-time job. So, I think it is important for college students to have it." 
I think that college students should have a part-time job. Because college students can obtain great deal of experience by having part-time. It can know the importance of the thing to earn money. The chance that it meets various people increases, too.  Actually, knowing the importance of money , and doing a useless shopping disappeared as for me after it began to having part time. Moreover , I was able to make friends a lot with the people. I was able to make friends with the people of various universities. ItÅ@is really happy to speak friends of various universities with various topics. It is planned to travel to various places with the friends who happily because it because it works part-time, and to make a lot of memories. I think that it should experience these things before it starts one's adult life.  It can be thought that the part-time job is a practice before it finds employment. I think that it is very important to experience the part-time job in the school days for the above-mentioned reasons. Moreover, I think it is necessary. If the part-time job was not experienced, I was housebound. The part-time job develops the person, and gives me a lot of valuable experiences.  So I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  
"I agree with the idea that college students should have a part-time job.  First, college students need a lot of money. For example, I think we  ourselves, not our parents, ought to pay our tuition fee of the college.  Furthermore, if you want to join a club, you have to pay an entrance fee. If  you want to go shopping with your friends, money is necessary.  Second, it is true that college students are very busy studying, but in my  opinion, we can cope with both studying and part-time jobs. These days,  there are some part-time jobs which we can take a day off from during the  test terms.  Third, to have a part-time job helps you to find what you want to do in the  future. There are a large number of college students who cannot decide their  future plans in detail. Therefore, if you have a part-time job which you are  interested in, you are able to choose the most suitable job for you after  graduating from the college.  For these reasons, in order to get significant campus life, it is important  for college students to have a part-time job. I donÅft have a part-time job  now, but I am going to have a part-time job during the summer vacation.   " 
"I agree this idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.There are three reasons.   Firstly,it is because that it is good chance for college students to take part in job until they graduates from college and have a full-time job. This experience is useful to find their full-time job. In addition,they really understand that it is difficult and important to get money. They thank their parents and begin to spend money more carefully. Some people say that college students should study and join a club activity. However,college students can get important things from not only studies but also a part-time job.   Secondly,it is because that college students can earn their tuition if they work as a part-timer. They are able to help their parents because tuition of college is high. In addition, college students can save money for some goals. In fact, a friend of mine works as a part-timer and save money in order to study abroad after she graduates from college. I canÅft think that she wastes time and her energy.   Finaly, college students can meet and communicate with a lot of people. Talking with many people is quite meaningful for college students. They can get very important   things from it. Also, it will be useful for them in the future.   For these three reasons, I think that college students should have a part-time job.  " 
"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  There are two reasons to agree with this idea. One is that part-time job is good experiences for college students. Second is that money is important to do what college students want to do.   Firstly, I will explain why part-time job is good experiences for college students. They can learn many things by having a part-time job. For example, I work as a tutor. I  learn how important it is to communicate with others, to greet each other, how hard it is to teach something and to get money. I think that what I learn from a part-time job is very useful in my life. If college students don't have a part-time job, they can't realize how hard it is to work, until they have real job. Therefore they worry about their jobs and they might quit their jobs.   Secondly, I will explain why money is important to do what college students want to do.  In this world, we need money to do something. By the way, how can college students get money, if they don't have a part-time job? Maybe, their families give them money, but they are not children yet, so they should get money to do something by themselves. For example, I want to enter a graduate school, so I need much money to enter. Therefore I have a part-time job and work very hard to save money.   That's why I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  " 
"I agree that college students have a part-time job.  It is true that they have less time to study what they are interested in due to having a part-time job. So they canÅft study enough. But I donÅft necessarily think so. This is because they can learn a lot of things, which they canÅft learn in colleges, and communicate many people through a part-time job. Furthermore they can buy books, clothes and other things by having a part-time job. For example, if you work at a restaurant, you can learn a service and cooking. If you work at a remover, you can strengthen your muscle. So the more occupations they experience, the more things they learn. Besides, what they learn through a part-time job is far more useful than what they learn in colleges. The money which they earn by a part-time job enables them to do a lot of things. For instance, they can go to class where they learn how to use a personal computer. And they can make a trip. They can buy comics, videogames and CDs. In other words, they can enjoy their hobbies by earnings which they get through a part-time job. In my opinion, college students have to have a part-time job to develop themselves as a member of society and to know how hard it is to earn the money. ThatÅfs why it is important for college students to have a part-time job.     " 
"I agree that college students do a part-time job. This is because I teach junior high school  students as a tutor now. One month have passed and I feel that I improve my ability to comm unication and accumulate social experience. I made a decision to continue it in early stage.   When college students become independent of their parents in the near future, they will nee d a lot of things such as economical and psychological independence.  A part-time job is sui table because it forces them to know society rules.  By the way, some people say that college students should not do a part-time job but a club  activity. But I think that only a part-time job has something that we cannot learn from a cl ub activity. For example, obeying a vertical relationship is more severely required in socie ty. Also, they earn money by themselves and will learn its importance. The best way is that  they actually experience. This is why a part-time job gives more useful things than a club a ctivity.  Few college students have done a part-time job until now. They have freedom and responsibil ity of their actions. They are almost equal to a member of society. It is better for college  students in order to be accustomed to society and learn their position of college students. " 
I disagree with that. Though every student with a part-time has different opinion towards or purpose for it, that does not mean that everyone feels it important to have a part-time job. They do not always consider the importance of job, but feel like to do it because most people around his/her have their job. There are other reasons. In general, part-time jobs foster social skills such as communication, cooperation. But these skills can also be acquired even if not having any part-time jobs. College students have a lot of time. Therefore, we can share with various kinds of people a lot of experiences such as clubs, circles, volunteer activities, and so on. I assume that we need to be related to various people from hard workers to younger people. Some people say that they should do for making money for living expenses. However, they do not always have difficulties with money. This is a completely private matter. So others have nothing to do with it. Extravagant students may need to have a job, but those with sense of frugality do not always need to. These are reasons for which I consider a job not to be needed, and I cannot find any reasons that make a job necessary 
"I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are some reasons that I think so. First, to do a part-time job is very good experience for us. We can acquire a lot of abilities by doing a part-time job, for example, cooking , conversation and so on. These abilities must be useful when we graduate college and start to work in society. Second, we can make a lot of friends with. We can also meet a lot of people who are older or younger than us. By meeting such people we can acquire a manner to come in contact with people. Third, college students have a lot of free time. If we do not have a part-time job, we cannot spend the free time efficiently, and our college life will be very boring. As a result we will spend our precious time only playing. Finally, by doing a part-time job we can feel pleasant of earning money by myself and feel the value of money. Till now we depended our money on our parents ,so we can not feel such feelings. Judging from such reasons, I think that there are a lot of good things to have a part-time job. So I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. " 
"I agree with this statement.  There are some reasons as ground for my opinion.     One reason is that college students who have part-time job can experience Åeworking adultÅf.  In the future, almost all the college students must work in society, and display their ability with all their strength, have responsibility for what they do all.  But, in this state of conditions, if there isnÅft any opportunity for making preparation to enter the society, they will be less likely to adapt themselves to society.  So, having part-time job is need. By doing this, they can develop themselves for their future.     Second reason is that by having part-time job, college student can money for their own purpose some freely.  Before they have part-time job, they accept money from their parents.  Of course, It is said that they independent from their parents.  And so, when they use money for their own purpose and pleasure, there is limitation in amount of money for use and they usually feel guilty.  So having part-time job is need. By doing this, they come close to the state of self-support, and get the chance of controlling a use of money by themselves.     Last reason is that by doing this, they can become acquainted with other people newly.  To encounter other people bring us much profit. Person who they meet in part time job is sometimes important friend throughout their life.  Getting this chance is very essential and delightful.  Considering these ideas, I agree this statement. " 
"I think part-time job is important for college students for several reasons.  First, college students have to spend so much money, for example, buy train or bus ticket, play with their friends, make meals, and buy clothes, books, and so on. So they must make money by themselves.  Second, they must learn how hard we earn money so that they will not be in trouble when they become working members of society. Most students were given pocket money by 18 years old which their father or mother earned. So they do not know how hard we earn money and how important money is.  Third, if they have part-time job, they will make friends with their collegues. Their collegues will give some piecies of information to them about other part-time jobs, various works, and other colleges, and they will be able to have connections. If they make friends with their collegues, their life will be good and happy.  Last, part-time job is the best way for them to be able to realize what is work and how they work efficiently because college life is the term when students are preparing for the real work.  So I think college students should work as part-time workers " 
"I agree with the opinion that it is important for college students to   have  a partÅ\time job. Indeed, the most important thing for students   is studying. So students should choice a kind of partÅ\time job   carefully in order to go college. But having a partÅ\time job has   a lot of good points. There are some reasons why I think so.    First, college students have to independent from their parents not   only financially but also mentally. College students will be able to   do this goal by having a partÅ\time job.  I think that we should   earn money which we use for hobby, clothes and so on.    Second, they will get a chance to have many kinds of associates who   cannot meet at only university studentÅfs life. There will be   several persons who have interesting personality or back ground of   life. They must play an important role in experience of   studentÅfs life.    Finally,Å@college students must learn about a society. After   they graduate from college, most of them will be a part of member of   social system. In order to be like it, they work with such person   before they graduate.    That is why I think that having a partÅ\time job is important   for college students.  " 
"I agree with  the  idea  that  it  is  important  thing  for  college  student to have  a  part  time  job.  Of course, we need money to buy what we  want,  such  as  clothes  or   motor bike,  or  to  pay  money  for  club activity.  Since our parents pay our educational expenses, we should make money  for our enjoyment.  But  I think  we  can  see  part time  jobs  in  a  different viewpoint.   After  graduation,  almost  all  of  us  will  have  a  job,  and  continue  to  work  in  the same  company  all the  life.  So  it  is  now  that  we  can  experience  many  kinds  of  job.   However,  I  think   we  should not   spend  all  of  our  free  time  to  our  part  time  job.  There  are  many  things  which  we  can  do  only  now.We  are  able  to  make  money  after  we  graduate  from  university.We  should  think  of  having  a  part  time  job  as  a  tool  for  knowing many  worlds,  such  as  education world,  bridal  world ,  or  food  world. There must be some chances to make us   think about   our   future.   For  these  reason,  I think  it  is  meaningful  thing  for  college  student  to have a part time  job.  " 
"I agree the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job for the following reasons. The first reason is that college students can learn difficulty of earning money by doing part-time job.  They become knowing how hard their parents work for their family.  They can understand the importance of money and their parents.  The second reason is that they can reduce the burden of their parents.  College students need a lot of money such as for living, school, amusement and so on.  If they don't do a part-time job, their parents have to pay the all of that money.  It is very heavy burden for their parents.  They should earn money and reduce the burden of their parents.  The final reason is that they can know which job is suited to them.  They can do many kind of part-time jobs for four years for example a waiter, an office work and so on.  One student may realize that he is good at service to people.  The other student may realize that he is good at the work of using computer.  Doing part-time job will be help to college students when they look for their future job.   That is why I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.   " 
"I agree with this statement. One of the reasons for this is that collage students should understand the meaning of working. For example, if we have a part time job, we need to be punctual, to care of our appearance, and to greet everyone. So we can know the manner of working, and we can act fittingly as workers. Of course, when we graduate from college, we are regarded as workers by persons around us, and we are demanded to do as workers naturally. So we have to acquire the way of polite action by graduating from college. It is true that we can learn about etiquette as persons who live in society, in college group such as club activities, but we can experience how hard it is to get money only when we work in fact. In fact, from my experience of part time job, I realize that my thought about job was so easy. If I did not have a part time job, I would go out in society with wrong thought, face to unexpected hard society and be disappointed. Therefore, some people say that part time job is a just way of getting money, but I think that it is a important opportunity for us to learn what is important to work. " 
"Å@I think college student should have a part-time job, because they have a lot of free time and college is a place where students find what they really want to do in their future. So, to use time effectively, they should try many things, whether they are interested in or not, and experience a lot. To experience many situations and to communicate with various kinds of people make their way of thinking about life more profound. If college students had a part-time job, they would get not only manners, tolerance, but also a chance to take part in society as a supplier. They have to realize how difficult to earn money. In my opinion, no one can get it, while they depend on their parents. Almost all college students are grown-up, so I think they should prepare money for living by themselves.  College students also have stamina, so it is very good for them to use it for learning about a lot of things, enjoying with their friends something which they can do at the time, and working hard in a part-time job. To do these things earnestly, these become their source of life. That is why we should do anything our best. " 
" I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time > job.There are two reasons why I agree that college students have a > part-time job. First, we need a lot of money to go outside. For example, we go bowling, shopping, do karaoke, enjoy parties and so on. If you stay in lodgings, you will need more money. So, it is important for us to have a part-time job. Second, we can obtain a lot of knowledge by working part-time and experiencing various jobs. For instance, the way of cooking, servicing, using computers and so on. When we get a lob after several years, we can utilize this knowledge. >  Certainly, we can make money by having a part-time job, while we lose free time for studying and enjoying club activities.  The important object at university is to study a lot of special knowledge. So we should think about the balance of three pointsÅ\having a part-time job, enjoying club activities and studying not to fail to pass on to the next grade. If you can balance them, you will be able to enjoy wonderful university life! In this way, I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job, but you should have a part-time job after much consideration.    " 
"I think it is good for college students to have a part-time job.There are three reasons for this. First,it allows them to earn money and enables them to engage in various activities.May tenth,I had a part-time job for the first time.I did a concert staff.I felt it was very hard.However,I learn a lot of things which I canÅft learn in the class.For example,I learn it difficult to earn money.I think students should develop their potential by taking part in as many activities as possible.Their potential will help them whatever you do. Second,a part- time job gives students an opportunity to learn about the real world. We have been studying various subjects at school.However,we are not able to learn about real world only at school.So,we should have a part-time job to broaden our view of life. Third,a part time job gives students some stories which they talk about. When you talk with someone who you meet for the first time,you can talk an interesting story about part-time jobs.You can make friend with many people. So,having a part-time job is a good way to develop ourselves.I want to do several part-time jobs and develop my potential.Of course,I want to get money too.   " 
"I think that it is great for college students to work part-time. First of all, in my case, I live by myself. So my mother supports money to live. But when I go shopping and go out somewhere with my friends, I shouldnÅft use money which my mother gave me. I think that it is bad to be supported too much money and to depend on our parents very much.  So, it is good for us to work part-time to be independent of our parents. Next, we can learn the importance to earn money and the hardship to work by working part-time. If we experience it during college days, we can consider our job in the future very well.  Third, we can make friends with through part-time job. We can do it in the college too. In this case, however, we canÅft make friends with other college students and people who are older than us. On the other hand, we can do it through part-time job. I donÅft still work part-time, but I want to start it soon. If I start it, I want to be independent of my mother little by little and make friends with many people. So  I think that it is great  for college students to work part-time. " 
"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  First, it is a good opportunity for us to know our society well.  When I finished the entrance examination of Kobe University, I started to work ice cream shop.  I had thought that I could enjoy working, but it was much harder than I had thought.  It was much harder than the study of examination in a sense.  I learned many things while I was working at the shop.  When I was selling ice creams, I involved with various people.  I had not been good at communicating with people before I worked.  However, while I involved with many people by selling ice creams, I could talk smoothly with people who I met for the first time.  I think I could grow myself by having a part-time job.  Thanks to a part-time job, I could have responsibility, and moreover, I can know the importance of money.  I learned how hard it was to earn money.  So, since I have started having a part-time job, I have not waste more money than before.  Furthermore, we could make many friends in a part-time job.  If I donÅft have a part-time job I cannot talk with a person who goes to another school.     For these reason, I agree the opinion that it is important for college student to have a part-time job.  " 
"I agree with this statement. One of the reasons is that college students have to earn money than ever before. For instance, they have to buy a lot of textbooks which are expensive and they have to wear clothes which are not uniform Monday to Friday and so on. So they have to have a part-time job to earn money. And main reason why I agree with this statement is that they can go through various things in part-time job before they get a job. I had part-time job in spring vacation. I worked as a clerk in gift shop. The shop sold gift of Sumo Tournament in Osaka. I experienced a lot of things in the job. Since Sumo is Japanese traditional sport, a number of foreigners came the shop and asked us about use of goods in English or Chinese and so on. So I couldnÅft speak foreign languages but I had to tell them as a clerk. Each time I explained to them with gesture.  To speak with gesture is a first experience for me and this experience would not go through without I worked the shop. I experienced any other valuable things. I think that they can learn by a lot of experiences through part-time job. Therefore I really agree with this statement. Å@Å@  " 
"Today, I want to talk about this topic as the affirmative side.  First of all, what is the part-time job for the college students? I think itÅfs the good opportunity to touch our society before we go out the society. From that, they can get the skill, for example, communication with their customer, cooking, or how to teach something to someone and so on. Moreover we can actually feel social situation, and know the significance of earning money.  However some people said that students have to work hard and late, and the environment in their workplace sometimes bad, for example smoking, drinking or something like that. So they disagree this topic because the part-time job will be obstacle for students to study.  Surely the main thing for the college students is studying in their college days. I admit this point. But I believe it doesnÅft mean all students have to do is only such thing. After the graduation and going out the society, we need not only knowledge we can get in universities but also other skill. Only knowledge itÅfs not enough. When you work in your company, you must negotiate with your clients, and keep the good relationship with your colleague. Such skill canÅft get from only universities. If we can get the basis of such skills during universities, we can quickly fit our society when we start working.  So to compare advantages and disadvantages, I believe the part-time job is important for college students as the preparation for working actually in our society." 
"I think part time job is not important for college student. Because they can study only while they are student, so they should spent their time for their study.  When they are student, they feel lecture is boring and not interesting. But they understand they waste their precious time after they graduate college and have to take a job. My parents often say that you have to study hard while you can study. And they say we don Åft save their money for your study, so you donÅft have to do part time job. I canÅft still understand importance of lecture. In the future lecture may help me. When I was little, I take many lessons. Piano, basketball, swimming, writing, English and so on. I don Åft like those at that time. But now I think they are useful. For example, thanks to basketball and swimming, I can get strength. Thanks to piano, I can read music. As long as those, lecture may help me in future. They do part time job for many reasons. Some of them have to part time job for their life. I am happy because I don Åft have to do part time job for my life. So I canÅft say college student should not do part time job. But college student should keep their mind that they spent their precious time on part time job.    " 
"I think that it is important for college students to have part-time job. In many case, a college student lives all by himself. Living all by oneself needs much of money. For example for food, clothes, lighting and heating expenses, rent, travel, expenses. So college students need enough money for life. Of course their parents could send them some money, it is desirable not to get on top of parents. And if college students have a little money, they can not make various activities. There are many clubs in courage. A club is very fun and they can make many friends. For doing club activity, college students should have part-time job and get enough money. We can not only get money but also precious experience from part-time job. Restaurant, service industry, there are many jobs. And there are various people in office. College students can study many things what can not study in college, for example the method of service, efficient job way. Those things good for everything in the world. In practice, I have worked in broiled meat shop. And I could get enough money and delicious board and good relationship. For those reasons, I agree this idea. Students should have part-time job! " 
"I think it is important for college student to have a part-time job. I have three reasons to think that. First, I can ready to go out into the world.  If I go into the world without having a part-time job, IÅfll be in trouble because I couldnÅft learn the manner to contact with others and the basic attitude on business.  I think I can learn the important elements of working in a part-time job. Second, I can understand the significance of money and the hardness to earn money through part-time job.  When I was still high school student, I took some money from my parents as pocket money and I used them without thinking specially.  But after I learn the hardness to earn money, I thank for my parents.  That is, I could study the value of money. Third, I can make many friends besides friends of college.  If I donÅft I have a part-time job, when I try to make friends, it is not easy to get out of a narrow range as a college. A part-time job is a place for meeting.  I can meet people of another college or much older people or much younger people.  They give me chances to enlarge my experience. The above explains why I think a part-time job is important for college students. Let me finish report with this. " 
"I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time-job. There are three reasons why I think so.   The first reason is that we can earn money by ourselves through a part-time-job, and we can buy what we want, do what we need to. I have a part-time-job now, and get a little money. I use the money for studying Ågfinancial plannerÅh, and my clothes.   The second reason is that we can experience the roll of working adults. I am working at a convenience store near my home now. The work is not so easy but this experience will help me to work as a working adult after I graduate from our college.   The third reason is that the money and experience we can get through a part-time-job help us to become independent. We cannot rely on our parents forever. We have to prepare for the independence, or we cannot establish ourselves.  After all, a part-time-job is not only for money but also for experience Of course, we are students, and we have to study. Perhaps, some students donÅft have enough time or need not to work, but I think that we should have a part-time-job to get a wide field of vision. " 
"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.   First, after graduating school, college students will work for their companies. So I think that they should learn how hard it is to work as a member of society. Now, I am working at gas station. The job is not light work. I have to achieve sales aim. To achieve sales aim, I have to sell engine oil, batteries, wipers, and more. It is not easy for me to do that. But when I start to work at company after graduating school, I will have to do more hard work. So I want to be used to these hardships. If I would not work at gas station, I am not able to spend such valuable time.  Second, I think that college students have to earn their living costs by their own. College students comparatively have many free times. So I think that they have enough time to work. In fact, I am belonging to music club and I have to practice the guitar, but I can have time to work and can earn my living cost. My friends also try to have time to work and they can do that. If I would not have a part-time job, I spend idle hours in my free time. I feel I am spending precious time when I work at gas station.  A part-time job is not easy, but we can feel fulfillment. So I think it is important to have a part-time job.  " 
"I agree with the idea that college students should have a part-time job.  Since college students must learn relation of society, common sences,  And communication skills. They are needed incredibly after graduation  Of the colleges. To explain his or her companyÅfs production or ideas  To cooperative companies, communication skill is absolutely needed.  On the other hand, common sences is needed whether students will  Work on company or not. No one can live alone. So, needless to say,  communication and common sences are very important to all the people.  But I think they are learned more in workerÅfs relations than in college   StudentÅfs relations.  For example, when I worked on IZAKAYA--Japanese bar-- , I missed   The form of cooking, then co-worker who is older than I became angry,  But thaught me the correct form of cooking kindly. On the one hand,  When I came there lately, the owner came to me and told me the importance  Of keep a time in society. And I still remember the words.   In college students relation, It is difficult to say the miss and to tell the  Caution. But in workerÅfs relation, one can say the misses and caution him   Or her.  So I agree with the idea that college students should have a part-time job.     " 
"I agree with this following statement. Roughly speaking, there are two  reasons that I think so. Naturally, the first reason is to get the money.  College students need much money in order to pay not only school expenses,  but also expenses for a circle activity. In addition to these expenses, they  spend money for playing with their friends, meals and so on. It is not so  good that they depend on their parents for all these money, because they are  already adults or near adults, and this time is when they should to ready to  become independence. So it is desirable that they have a part-time job to  earn the part of these necessary expenses. Of course, it is out of question  that having the job interferes with studies in their college. It is  important to work moderately. The second reason is t experience working in  society. Most of students become a member of society after they graduate. So  I think that college life is a shift time toward social person. In this  time, it is advantageous to spend their life after college life that they  experience working and getting money by themselves. I think it is important  to continue to work in same place, but I also think it is important to  experience diverse jobs. By experiencing many jobs, they can acquire various  abilities and broaden their insights. Because of these two reasons, I agree  to their having a part-time job. But as mentioned above, it is important  that working donÅft disturb their studies. " 
I agree with college students who have a part-time job.  Because working is replacing time by money, students can spend time effectively.  In Japan it is often said that a period of time of university is a moratorium, but they eager to make good use of the period. In fact, they donÅft like free time.  To try to reduce free time, they study, play with their friends, go to the club to which they belong, and have a part-time job.  The thing which they have a part-time job is a reasonable selection for college students who want to cut free time.  They can get some money if they go to a part-time job.   I think that a time of university is a time of  investment in our own future.  Though college students could have the choice to work after they graduate from high school, they go to university, and they also go to a part-time office to work.  It seemed a mistake. But it is not a mistake because an investment is indispensable some money. Here is a problem.  College students will face the problem that they have to get money for investment by myself  Its solution is a part-time job.  So, we can conclude that a part-time job for college students is reasonable because they can consume their precious free time effectively and get some money to invest.     
   It is important for college students to have a part-time job.  I agree with this statement. I think all of college students should experience a part-time job, at least once, during their school life, because through it, they can learn how hard to earn money is.   ?Before I experience a part-time job, I got money from my parents. I spent it playing with my friends, eating fast foods, buying clothes etc. But I soon exhausted all money, because the amount of money which I could use per a month was limited by my mother. I irritated about that, and thought that Ågwhy my mother doesnÅft give me more money?Åh   Then I entered Kobe University and started working as a part-timer (I work at a Japanese bar as a waitress), and knew how hard to earn money is. At workplace, I have to bear many painful duties. For example, I must keep smiling, must run, must take heavy dishes, must be kind to every customer, and sometime IÅfm scolded by my master. These make me very tired, but after enduring them, I can get money. In this way I really knew the value of money. We should not spend money without knowing how thankful thing money is.  ThatÅfs why I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  
I agree with this opinion. I have three ideas.  First, college students have to lern how hard to earn money is. In order to make money,  you have to smile  even when you don Åft feel good, you have to obey  your manager even if you donÅft like him or her.It is not so easy to earn money, but by knowing it, you can lern how important money is. If you guraduate from college without knowing it, you may spend hard time when you get job.  Second, you can be known with a lot of people. By having a part-time job, you can communicate with a lot of people. Some people go to other colleges and other people don Åft go to college and have been working for a long time. You can lern so many things from these peple.   Finally, by doing part-time job, you can enjoy college life more. You can Åft date with your boy friend or girl frend , you canÅft hang out with your friends on weekend if you don Åft have money.If you work at part-time job harder, your can get money and you can enjoy dineer with your lover or drinking with your friends. Ofcourse, it is very important to study when you go to college, but these things are also important for college students. It Åfs because you will be busy in working and you wonÅft have enogh time to do these things after graduation.  So, to make your college life better, you should do part-time job and make money. 
I agree with the idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  I have 3 reasons.  First, we need more money than when we were in our high school.  In order to go to the college, some of us need to take trains with paying the high fare, and some of us need to lend apartment because their houses are too far.  And more, we have to pay much money to study in the college.   Second, we need to have experiences of working and earning.  After graduates, most of us will start working.  Then, if we have no experiences of working and earning, we have to start working without noticing the importance of working with having a responsibility.  Under this condition, the work must not be done well.  So we need to learn the importance of working with a responsibility earlier. Finally, if we have a part-time job, we can become a more social person.  In the university, we have much time with people who are in the same generation.  No one is the same with others, but we sometimes tend to have a same thinking because of our similar environment.  When we work, we need to communicate with various people.  They may have a different idea from us, so we will try to consider what they want, what they need, or what they feel.  Then we can learn how to make a good human relationship. For these reasons, I think that college students should have a part-time job. 
I disagree with this idea. I donÅft think that itÅfs important for college students to have a part-time job. The main reason is that the most important thing for them is studying hard. I have three ideas to support my opinion.  First, they have to realize how precious college days are. They can freely study what they really want to do only during college students. Before college students, they just did what their teachers forced or recommended them to do. And after their graduation from college, only a few of them will be able to do what they really want to do as their jobs. ThatÅfs way I think that ÅgnowÅh is very precious and that they have to study hard, not work.  Secondly, IÅfve ever seen many bad examples of college students who have a part-time job. Some of them are sleeping even during classes because of tiredness from their jobs. Others often skip classes to go to their jobs. Still others get sick because they are too busy in both studying and working to get enough sleep or rest. They have to make a right decision about their priority, that is to say, they should consider which is more important for them, studying or working.  Thirdly, such bad students as IÅfve mentioned can have a bad influence on other students. For example, some students might skip classes more easily, sometimes without any reasons. And classes, especially group works will not work well because of such students. These examples are only a part of all.  As a result, I insist that college students should put their priority on studying, not working.  
I disagree with the opinion that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  What college students do most is obviously studying.  They go to college in order to push themselves to new heights.  They should acquire much knowledge to prepare for their future jobs and broaden their outlook.  But most of them, including me, have a part-time job and spend their limited time pursuing their temporary pleasure.  They earn money in order to play with friends or buy luxury things.  And actually the more money I earn, the more money I want to get.  For example, I want to go on a trip, buy clothes, and eat delicious foods.  I need more and more money.  Now it is no exaggeration to say that I am obsessed with money.  Then those who work at bars or convenience stores have to work by midnight.  It is terrible for their health.  It may affect their lifestyles as college students.  They tend to skip a meal, lose sleep, or miss lessons.  You may say that not a few students have a part-time job to pay their school fees by themselves or to study abroad.  I think, however, the government helps them by offering scholarships so that they can concentrate on studying.  College students have a lot to learn.  They have no time to have a part-time job.  
It is important for college students to have a part-time job.       I agree this opinion. I will explain why I agree it. ÅeExperienceÅf , I think it is the most important and precious thing for younger generation. Think about university students, most of them had not worked from small age to 19 or 20 years old. Because they have to enter famous university, so they study and study every day. Only they do is Åestudy on the deskÅf.      But after they graduate university, most of them must be work. Now I run a small company, I think people who canÅft think by themselves are increasing recently. Their style of thinking is one way. They donÅft know that there are various kind of people in the world. They only know their small world, family or friends. It is a serious social problem. Å@Å@Å@And another problem is there. About 40% people who are just out of university leave their company within three years. Most of them say that the work does not different one what they think about. Or they do not feel interests about their work. They think the job is not fit for them.     Of course Åepart-time-jobÅf may take time from them. The problem may occur. Some students do only work instead of their study.     But, ÅePart-time-jobÅf for university students will give them precious experiences and many important things. They will learn about the structure of  world.  And they will feel how difficult to earn their own money. ÅePart-time-jobÅf will give them many presents.  
I agree with this statement.  This is because college students need to know what working is like.  First of all, I talk about my example.  When I was the first grade at university, I didnÅft have a part-time job.  But now, I am the second grade and have a part-time job, because I want to learn what working is like before I graduate from university.   At first I was worried and tired, but now I am used to my job.  And I can know how difficult communicating with many people is and know making money is not easy, and so on.  I cannot learn those things from a lecture in university.  Then, I explain why you have to know how working is while you are college student.  Some people say that college students should not have a part-time job because they work too hard to study in a lecture. Of course, studying is very important.  However, will you really need only an academic skill in the future?  YouÅfll work with many people such as co-workers, bosses or customers.  And you have to communicate with them.  Even if you sufficiently have an academic skill, you canÅft work alone.  Recently, people who donÅft have a job have been increasing.  Some people donÅft work though they graduate from a college.  After they graduate from their college, they have a job.  But, they bother about human relations and resign their job.  Therefore, you should be used to communicating with many people while you are college student.  In university, you mainly talk to your friend.  But, if you have a part-time job, you have to contact with many people.   You can learn from a part-time job how to communicate with many people.  So to conclude, college students need to have a part-time job.  
I think it is important for collage students to have a part-time job. I had three part-time jobs for a while. One is in a yakiniku restaurant. The other is in a yamucha restaurant. Another one is a cram school teacher. I learned a lot of things at each other part-time jobs.  First, I learned the fun of working in yakiniku restaurant. The restaurantkeeper taught me how to deal dishes to customers gently. And, I got many good friends there. We are good friends after I resigned there. And, I got my voice loud because we  always say ÅuIrassyaimase!Åv ,ÅuArigatougozaimasita!Åvto customers.   Next, in yamucha  restaurant, I learned how to dish up. It was precious time and it was fun to me.  I always didÅft make dinner in my house, but I got to make dinner after I learned how to dish up there. Lastly, I learned it is difficult to teach to someone in the cram school. We teachers should think about how to teach to easy understand for each student. It sometime makes me confused but it made me maturity. Like this, part-time jobs teaches us a lot of things for alive. And, it is fun to buy something you want by paying money you got after you work. We can learn sociality by having part-time jobs. So, I think it is important for collage students to have a part time job. 
I donÅft agree with this statement. Surely, itÅfs important for college students to challenge and experience many things. Through having a part-time job, Students often find many important things, such as the strict of the society, how to communicate with bosses, or how to speak formal Japanese language. And they find the real worth of money by working and earning money by themselves. Because they got money, they must work hard. People raise their senses of responsibility through a part-time job. But, I think, there is more important thing for us than it. It is a collage life. As I state above, there are lots of things which are learned from it, so I think itÅfs good to challenge many things, if they have much free time. But I donÅft think so if they have not so much time. What are experienced from it are preparations for us and they will help us in the future. But, in other words, we will work in this society in future, and all of us must experience workings ever after graduating from a collage. But, studying which learned in a collage is what learned only now. We have entered a collage and we have chances to learn our favorite things for detail, so we should make the most of our chances. And in collage lives, if we have what we want to do, such as club activities, hobbies and lessons, we should put them before working.   We can have a part-time job anytime, so we should do it when we have much free time. That is why I think itÅfs good for college students to have a part time job, but not important. 
I agree with the idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. First, they need much money to lead a college life- Playing with friends, for example, eating, shopping, and activities in a circle and so on. They mustnÅft rely on our parents. They can stand their own legs and can lighten the burden on our parents by earning money. They will realize how enjoyable it is to earn money on their own and to buy what they want by using it. Second, we will probably belong to a company or an organization after they graduate from a college. But, if they wouldnÅft have immunity to real society, you would be embarrassed and at a loss, when you begin to work. That is to say, in advance by experiencing how real society is they can prepare for working, and smoothly receive it. Third, they will have many skills by doing a part-time job Service skill, for example, office work skills education skill, cooking skill, and so on. Such skills would give them much benefit when they work in a company and in their life. However, doing a part-time job too much has a bad influence upon their study and as a result    upon their life. It is necessarily very good to properly have a part-time job.   
 I agree with this statement.   First, if college students have a part-time job, we can buy a lot of things which we want, need not to spend our free time. Moreover, one of my friends told me that it is important to know our society is not easy. I think that we will learn the importance of money if we make efforts to work. And also, all of the college students who live alone can use our salary for costs of our living. Some of my friends use their all salary for their college life such as school fees and money which they rent their house. I really respect them. Furthermore, my friends of my high school days who work at a restaurant have a skill of cooking. In many part-time jobs, we get some skills and the skills use our whole life.   Second, if college students work part-time job for a lot of hours, we will not spend to have a good time of our college life because we may not have a time of our club activities, studying and enjoying ourselves. However if we work moderately, we need not to be worried about their problems. So there are no troubles.   This is why, part-time jobs have many profits. I think that we should have a part time job. 
It is important for the college student to have a part-time job   I sure that part-time job is very important for us  Of course, It is because that we can earn some money to live However It is because that We can get a necessary thing in our society by working part-time too Now I work as the lecturer of the private supplementary school now. I was not able to use the honorific definitely. I was not able to support a telephone I was not able to keep time Then , by working I sensed fear of society and how immature I was. Moreover we can know importance of money by working hard But part-time job have not only good thing. ÅuI am student.Åv  We must not forget it. That is to say, we lose a lot of time to study by working but our priority is studying Certainly it brings us many knowledge and growth but we must not do only it. Part-time job makes our college life more great Actually I am feeling so now So I think that it is best that we study and have a part-time job at a same time From now ,I am going to do so.  
Å@I agree with the statement. Because, I have had part time job since July, I thought that this will be good for me in the future.    I work as a staff of various events on my holidays. Then, I meet a lot of people in a day. At first, I donÅft know a way of speaking and behavior. But, through my part time job, I learn a lot of things little by little. When we become a working member of society, we will have to meet and speak with all types of people. Then, ability to communicate will be needed for us.   And I have heard before that young people of the day donÅft have an ability to communicate with others older than them. So I think it is important for young people to be used to communicate with others in different generations and different conditions, so as not to be thought that.     Anyway, I think it is important for young people to experience various things. Part time job is a great opportunity to experience to a lo of kinds of situation and learn a lot of things. So I think it is important for young people to have part time job.   
My opinion is that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  I have three reasons that I agree with the following statement.  First reason is that having a part-time job is a good lesson of society for us.          SchoolÅfs situation and relation are out of the ordinary.  In the old days, both may be similar, but that between college students and teachers changed.College students respect teachers now lesser than before.  Now, the relation between college students and teachers is different from that between employees and their superior.   Second reason is that college life costs a lot of money for college students.  In college, they have not only study but also various actions, for example, activity of  a circle, a fun with their friends and so on.  And all things including study cost a lot of money for them.   Third reason is that they understand the importance and hard work of earning money.  I think that they understand so because of having a part-time job.  Then I think that they spend money now more carefully than before.  And if their parents give them money, they will thank their parents for their cooperation.   Therefore, IÅfm of the opinion that college 
I think it is not important for college students to have a part-time job. But now, I have two part-time jobs Å| the karaoke studioÅfs clerk and the teacher of a cram school. I enjoy working and there are a lot of friends at work.  In addition to them, the salary is not low. I get about one hundred thousands yen per a month. And I use it for going abroad, buying clothes, playing and so on. The money is used for me and satisfies my life. From these points of view, having a part-time job is good for us.   But there are some bad points. I work on the night shift. So I can not sleep at night. Because of it, my physical and mental conditions become worse and worse. For example, my condition of skin became bad and I get irritated easily.  And there are a lot of friends who are late for school around me. Most of them say ÅgI got up late because of part-time jobÅh And I often say that ,too.  The college students are not workers but people who study a lot of things. So we must not absent ourselves from studying. There are few part-time jobs which donÅft have a influence on studying. So I think it is not important for college students to have a part-time job. 
I agree with part-time jobs of college students. We can experience jobs and other important things which we canÅft learn in the university. Now I work at the hotel as a waitress for Weddings and parties. I have to be careful about my speech and manner more than usual. ItÅfs hard for me to acquire them perfectly but surely it will be useful after I get out into the world. And how to talk with my superiors is also important because there are people who are far older than me. Next, the way to spend our time will be better. Part-time job takes long time, so weÅfd better finish our assignments or do something without wasting time. In fact, after I started my part-time job, I do everything more efficiently than before. But I think itÅfs not good to work too much because we can experience various things when we are college students and we can have chances to communicate with a lot of people. ItÅfs better to try actively what we want to do.  Moreover, having a part-time job enables us to learn how to spend money well. We must control ourselves so as not to waste it when we get a lot of it. And if we find it happy to earn money, we will be motivated to work hardly in the future.  Therefore, having a part-time job is good for college students. 
I donÅft agree the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in Japan. I think it is problem to prohibit smoking completely. There are two reasons why smoking shouldnÅft be entirely banned.  First, tobacco has strong dependence. A lot of smokers canÅft stop smoking even if they want to break their habit of smoking. If people who are smoking really stop smoking, they must have fixed preparation. It would take long time to succeed in no smoking.  Second, there are many smokers in Japan. We canÅft disregard the population of smoking people.  Today, the treatment for smokers becomes more and more severe. For example, smoking is basically prohibited in platform and shopping center. It is permitted only in smoking room.  Like this, I think we should not ban completely but divide between smoking seats and nonsmoking seats at all the restaurant in Japan. If smoking is banned completely, smokers would be dissatisfied. But of course it must not be entirely allowed. If itÅfs not divided, people who donÅft smoke would be displeased. There are a lot of people who hate tobacco because itÅfs fact that smoking injures our health. We should consider both of them.  So I think smoking shouldnÅft be completely banned at the entire restaurant in Japan. 
ÅgSmoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in JapanÅh I agree to this opinion on the whole.  I dislike tobacco and I think it is worth than useless. It cause lung cancer and have a bad influence upon babies especially for women who has babies. So I wish tobacco died from all over the world.  I understand that I should allow smokers also have the right to smoke. If he or she hopes to smoke, we canÅft invade his or her right to smoke. But I canÅft endure being made to breathe the smoke. What we allow smokers to do is the right to smoke only for them, not the right to make others smoke. Smokers must not mistake this point. That is to say, I think smokers must not smoke in the place where they canÅft account for their smoke.Å@The restaurant is the place where men and women of all ages come. So I think smokers must not smoke in the restaurant. I have one more reason. Breathing the smoke, we canÅft savor the original taste and smell of food. If there are no smoking seats, the smoke float and come to the seats. People who donÅft smoke canÅft enjoy their dinner after all. So I think smoking should be banned completely.   
I want to ban smoking in restaurant for family, but I donÅft think itÅfs necessary that banning smoking in restaurant which almost customers are adults ,for instance bar.  Cigarette is harmful for people not only who smoking but also people around him/her. But it doesnÅft effect too much to mention for adults during short time such as meal. So I donÅft think it is not necessary to care too much. Of course there are many people those who donÅft like cigarette, so if they are at same place smoking people must care around him/her. But for children cigarette is very harmful, and children canÅft care by themselves, so adults surround him/her must care of them for instants of children, especially parents and smoking people. One of the ways to keep children from harm of cigarette is banning in restaurant for family.     I think that important thing is not only regulations, but also morals of smoking people. If all smokers always pay attention situation around him/her, severe restricts are not needed. Due to some bad manners smokers, many smokers who smoke keeping moral involved and are restricted as much as bad smokers. I think it is more ideal smokers are restricted not by regulations, but their own good sense.   
I donÅft agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I have two reasons.  First, smokers cannot eat out and enjoy with their friends if smoking is controlled at restaurants. These days smoking is prohibited at many restaurants and cafes. My family and some friends are also smokers so when I go out with them, we have to search the restaurants where we are allowed smoking. I let them smoke at least when we rest. Surely smokes may be unpleasant for people who donÅft smoke. However, if so, restaurants have only to part smoking section and nonsmoking section so I think smoking donÅft need to be banned.  Second, if smoking is prohibited, people smoke out of buildings and town become unsanitary. When I went to New York, people smoke on the street because smoking is controlled at almost buildings. Therefore many cigarette butts are on the street. Accordingly that people are allowed smoking in the buildings is better than that street become dirty.  By these reasons, I donÅft think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. The best way for smokers and nonsmokers is the way to part smoking area and nonsmoking area. If so, we can choose which area we stay and people who donÅft smoke also eat and rest comfortably.  
I disagree with the opinion smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.   There are three reasons why I think so. First, people who smoke frequently or who canÅft stop smoking can not relax to eat lunch or dinner in a restaurant or are hesitate to enter a restaurant. Then, the number of people who eat foods in restaurants and income will decline, and managers of restaurants will be in trouble. Restaurants should meet all the customerÅfs demands.  Second, smoking people have the right to smoke. I think that only the non-smoking peopleÅfs right should not be respected. Particularly, in a restaurant which people often use, such a regulation should not be strengthened. In Japan, where people make a point of rights, we all the more should not do so.   Third, I think there is a better method than the opinion if smoking is too much annoying. In the restaurants, we divide the room into smoking area and non-smoking area. So, smoking people can smoke without concerning and non-smoking people arenÅft exposed smoke.     Because of these three reasons, I disagree with this opinion..   
 I agree with this opinion because I hate it very much personally. In addition, I donÅft like its smoke because no one smokes in my family. Then I would like to explain three more reasons in the following passage.      Firstly, if there are some people who are smoking in the restaurant, the air around me also becomes bad. If all the people in the restaurant smoked, no one would feel bad with the air. But some people smoke. Others donÅft smoke. I think that we should take more consideration into the latter than the former.         Secondly, smoking does harm with not only the smoking person but also others around him. In addition, I have heard that the smoke does more harm with people who donÅft smoke than smoking people. In such a place as restaurants, more and more people will be broken their health.      Thirdly, dishes become not delicious by breathing the smoke. Even if the dishes which we like very much are carried in front of me, we wonÅft be able to enjoy eating by breathing the smoke. I think we should concentrate on enjoy eating in restaurants.      For these reasons, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  
I agree with this statement. I suggest that smoking should be banned at not only all the restaurants but also all the public place. I have some reasons for thinking so.       First, smoking is harmful not only to smokers but also to people around smokers. When people are smoking, smokes come out and people around smokers take in that smokes automatically. This is called passive smoking. Passive smoking is much more harmful to our bodies than smoking. Therefore, smoking should be banned at public place where there may be people who do not want to smoke.       Second, I hate smell of cigarettes and I think some people think so. If I go to a restaurant, eat delicious dishes and feel so happy, once I smell cigarettes, I feel so bad even in non-smoking seat. This is because I maybe feel that the dishes taste bad and clothes smell smokes of cigarettes.       Third, if people walk with smoking, it might be dangerous for people, especially for children, to be burned by cigarettes. Recently, walking with smoking is decreasing in the effect of commercials, but walkers with smoking still remain. Walking with smoking causes another problem. That is throwing cigarettes away. It makes beauty of cities bad.       In conclusion, smoking is harmful to all people and makes some people feel bad. Therefore, smoking should be banned at all public places. 
I donÅft agree with this opinion, and I have couples of reasons why I donÅft. So I will show you what they are like.  First of all, it is true that smoking is such a nuisance for those who donÅft smoke. My mother really hates people with the habit of smoking. If she happens to take a seat close to a smoker, she will keep making a face till we leave the restaurant. However, no matter how non-smokers are suffered from it, I think that it should be up to smokers. I mean, we shouldnÅft rely on prohibiting thing but developing its moral.  For the second, there is a growing number of non-smokers or ex-smokers these days, but it is true that there are still so many people who love cigarette. So I think it is not fare for them to banning smoking at all restaurants. And it is really a problem for the nicotine-addicts.   For these reason I give, I donÅft agree with that opinion. I think we shouldnÅft be so radical. We should be calmer down, and give the problem a careful look. I think this problem is complicated, so we had better try to respect each other and each circumstance. 
 I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Although I had smoked the cigarette before, I have not done so in any longer now. There are many things that I have noticed after giving up smoking.       Firstly, the smoke hurts health of the people whom there is around a smoking person. For example, the smoke promotes getting to cancer. And the damage of the smoke is bigger than the one to a person smoking. I think the smoke is bad even if the restaurant is divided into a smoking room and the nonsmoking room because all the restaurants are full with the smoke.      Secondly, for the people who do not smoke, smoke of cigarettes is not a good thing of a feeling. It is to say nothing of the smokes it to damage health, and it is not a good smell. The smoke makes those who are around the person smoking feeling bad.      Thirdly, the smoke of the cigarette makes the room dirty. The smoke changes the color of the wall of the restaurant. Because the cleanness is lost, the impression of the restaurant gets worse. So it is not good for the restaurant.      This is why I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. 
 I against that opinion because there are many people who smoke after dinner or lunch in restaurants, and they canÅft stop smoking. It is pity that those people canÅft smoke in restaurants suddenly.      In fact, smoking is wrong for our health, and effect people who donÅft smoke, but I think that it is ok if smoking people separated from not smoking people thoroughly. Smoking is not good for us, but this custom has been continued for a long time, so all the people canÅft stop it. Besides, smoking is different from drugs. Drugs are crime, but smoking is not guilty. I hope that smoking is permitted in restaurants. By the way, I donÅft smoke.   
I agree with this idea that smoking should be completely banned at the entire restaurant in Japan. I have three reasons.     Firstly, this is because that smoke is too bad for all the people. According to the survey, breathing smoke indirectly is worse for health smoking directly. Breathing smoke of tobacco causes lung cancer.     Secondly, this is because most of people who donÅft smoke hate smoke. It is fool thing that people who donÅft smoke suffer from lung cancer because of breathing smoke indirectly, so they hate smoke. I suggest one example. When you eat dinner with your boss in the restaurant and he is smoking, if you hate smoke, can you ask him not to smoke? When youÅfre in this situation, I think the restaurant that bans from smoking is convenient. Optionally, employees who hate smoke are easy to come to work.     Thirdly, it takes expense very much to install a fan that take in the smoke of tobacco in each table. If smoking is banned, the fan is needless.     In conclusion, because of these reason I agree that this idea. If I say a desire, smoking should be completely banned not only at the restaurant but also at the other place we visit. 
 I think we should completely prohibit smoking at a restaurant. I have three reasons for this.      At first, we know that smoking is worse than useless. For example, smoking makes strong a possibility we get cancer, suffer from a disease, and miscarry. And the most dangerous thing is passive smoking. Passive smoking means cigarette smoke affects non-smokerÅfs health. Cigarette is harmful for not only smoker, but also non-smoker.      At second, now smokers have no rule. Only when a law is enacted, they observe the law. They must consider what they should be like.      At last, I think smoking keeps from communication. For example, when I talk to my friend or family, IÅfm offended by smoking. Because I feel like their being unwilling to hearing me. This opinion depends on a person. But the number of persons who feel like that is not a little.      These three points are main reasons for prohibiting smoking. So I agree that we should completely prohibit smoking at a restaurant. 
   I agree that smoking should be completely banned at the all restaurant. Why do I think so? Because I do not like the smell of cigar smoke. And when I eat something at the restaurant, if there are smoking people near my seat, I feel unfortunate and displeasure. When I eat something, if the smokes of someone are blown, I feel annoying. I think that everyone feel displeasure in such situation. When I go restaurant with my family, my father smokes cigarettes. My mother and I feel uncomfortable. So I think Japanese restaurant owner should make restaurants where only smokers can enter. If there are people who do not like the smell and smoke of cigar, they can not enter the restaurant. By doing so, people who do not like cigarette feel good at the other restaurant. And smokers do not have to care about non smokers. Therefore I think smoking should not have to be completely banned at the all restaurant. I suggest that owner or manager of the restaurant should make ÅgSmokerÅfs restaurantÅh.
I take objection to this opinion. I think it is too severe for smoker. Recently smoking has been regulated almost everywhere. ItÅfs difficult to smoke easily. However, if smoking is completely banned at also restaurant, smoker will be irritated.    Because they have no place to smoke, they smoke at restaurants, coffee shop and smoking room. In fact, itÅfs true that smoking is harmful to health. But itÅfs their own responsibility. There are surely many smokers who arenÅft sensible. Some people smoke even at nonsmoking area, are smoking on the street and throw away a cigarette everywhere without thinking. They should be care about people around. But not every smoker is insensible. Some smokers obey the rule.  People smoke because they are under a lot of stress. There are many difficulties in todayÅfs world. But we must keep on fighting them. Cigarette is the only way to reduce stress for smoker. So if it is taken away, what should smokers do? I think that the recent regulation is overrun. I do not smoke. My friends say they donÅft like people smoking. IÅfm different from them. I donÅft care about smoking very much. ItÅfs not strange for adult to smoke, I think so.   TodayÅes Japan is healthy oriented. So smoking is hated more. ThereÅfs the way it goes. 
I agree with this statement. Because I dislike tobacco very much personally! Although my personal opinion apart, there are lots of people who are poor at the smoke of tobacco. For them, it is hard that being smoked in a side more than a smoker considers. From the beginning, there are many arguments for and against smoking. Of course, I also understand that it is difficult to forbid smoking extensively legally now and that a smoker cannot part with tobacco easily so. However, passive smokers are injured their health than active smokers because the smoke that smokers exhaled includes a lot of harm. I cannot allow this fact. So I want smokers to try keeping off smoking in public places for non-smoking persons.   Come to the point, restaurants are places to enjoy eating. I think that restaurants should be places which everybody can use comfortably. If someone smokes while person poor at the tobacco enjoy eating, how does he feel? Probably he will not be able to go on enjoying eating. I actually have found situations like this many times when I worked part-time in Italian restaurant. The restaurant which I was working had not divided the place into smoking and non-smoking sections. Therefore, there were visitors who wear the face which seems to be unpleasant by the smoke of the tobacco from the next table. I felt bad seeing cases like this. Although I understand that it is impossible to impose a duty of prohibition of smoking in all public places, I would like to define prohibition of smoking at restaurants at least so that everybody can enjoy eating pleasantly.  
Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I agree with this idea. There are three reasons why I canÅft agree with the ban on smoking. First, I donÅft smoke because I hate this smell. When someone smokes, I feel sick and my clothes get annoying smell. I canÅft bear this smell, and its state.  Second, perhaps this may be a prejudice that smoking people donÅft have good manners because smoking seems to be bad manners in Japan. So I consider someone smokes at restaurants to be a nasty. At last, smoking does harm not only smokersÅf health but non-smokersÅf. My mother would not smoke but in her office some people are heavy smoker. So she is a passive smoker. She perhaps will get a lung cancer in the future. I think that this behavior is a crime. Needless to say I strongly feel that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. However, I think that it is impossible to be banned at all restaurants in Japan. I want to insist it is the truth that someone really hates smoking like me. So I want them to think about non-smokers. To keep good manners make good circumstance, I think.  
 I do not think that smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. It is fact that smoking does much harm not only to smokers but also to non-smokers. However, I have never felt being bothered by smokers at restaurants, as long as they are smoking at areas where smoking is allowed. Such areas are established because they help both smokers and non-smokers. Smokers should keep rules. In other words, their right should be kept as long as they keep rules. Smoking is a kind of amusement. We should not sing a song loudly at a street, but it is allowed at a karaoke box. Of course, I do not think smoking is not a good behavior, but as you know, smoking is very addictive. We should keep it in mind the idea that there are many people who cannot part with cigaretts. If we ban smoking at any place one after another, there will be no place where smoking is allowed, and finally many people complain. This is why I do not think that smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. There are some reasons that I insist on in this way. First, this may not be known widely; more than 4,000 kinds of chemical substances are included in the smoke of the cigarette. And surprisingly, as for the chemical substances more than 200 kinds of those, harmfulness is proved. Three materials which are the most famous for such a toxic material are tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide. It is proved that these materials induce the fatal diseases such as cancer, heart trouble, and the cerebral infarction medically. Second, this is to be connected with the first reason, there is the problem of people around the smoker. These problems are generally called the problems of passive smoking, the passive smoker take in the toxic substances in the body just to be in the place. Besides, according to the medical study, it proved that influence that the smoke of the cigarette is worse for a woman and a minor. The restaurant is the place where various people gather for a meal, there may be the people who want to refuse smoking in there. Because the restaurant is a place to eat not a place to smoke. So I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I have two reasons.  The first reason is that I think smoker may have less opportunity to smoke in a day. Smoking is bad to humanÅfs health if smokers smoke too much. The probability of getting lung cancer will be increase. In addition, too much smoking stain teeth.   They will smoke too much in a restaurant because they can relax there. So, if only not to smoke in a restaurant, the number of cigarettes which they smoke will be decrease.   The second reason is that smoking affect not only smokersÅf health but also othersÅf health. If they have a lunch or dinner with their friend at a restaurant and smoke a cigarette, he or she breathes the smoke of cigarettes. Then, it is possible that the smoke affect their friendsÅf health. Beside, if he or she hates the smell of the smoke, he or she will be displeased at the smoke. He or she can not enjoy having a lunch or dinner and talking.   Then, if they smoke at a restaurant, the smoke will affect also people who are at the near table.   So, I think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. 
I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I think smoking should be strictly controlled by the law. I have some friends who smoke and my father smokes, too. I donÅft like the smell of tobacco. I think there are a lot of people who dislike the smell likely to me.  Generally speaking, tobacco do people harm and give no benefit. Smoking increase risk of disease, lung cancer and those who are smoking is likely to die more early than people who arenÅft. But even if we donÅft smoke, we actually suffer from harm by smoke from the smoking people. At restaurants, many people including children and old people have lunch or dinner. So if there are people of smoking at restaurants, they do children and old people harm before notice it. This is very bad thing for children to grow. You may think there are two kinds of seat at restaurant, smoking seat and nonsmoking seat, but we canÅft say we are completely protected from the smoke. Unfortunately, sometimes the nonsmoking seats are filled and we have to sit at the smoking seat.  So I agree with that statement. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants, less and less people may be smoking and I wish it would be true.  
I agreed that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  Çshe risks of passive smoking are pointed out in recent years. Most of people know smoking cause lung cancer. So, smokers do while knowing it. But, in fact, the risk of lung cancer of passive smoking is higher than that of smoking, because the smoke which appears from a cigarette includes more toxic substance than the smoke which the smoker breathes. This is serious for a pregnant woman. Though the pregnant woman does not smoke, a disease and an obstacle occur to the child who has been produced by passive smoking, and, in the case of the worst, miscarriage and to have a baby born dead occur. Recently, some shops, restaurants and public accommodations decide to separate smokers and nonsmokers in the same room. And at the station, a specific smoking place is made. But these are incomplete separations. Smoke of a cigarette comes to a non-smoking section by wind and when nonsmokers go along the neighborhood, they breathe the smoke of the cigarette. I think if the risk of passive smoking occurs a little, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. 
I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants.  There are two reasons why I agree with the ban on smoking. First, for non-smokers, passive smoking is very trouble issue. In restaurants, to avoid the passive smoking, there are two kinds of sheets, for non-smokers and smokers. But that is not so effective. This is because when we eat, we sometimes smell smoke. Then, we feel delicious meal becomes not delicious one. Families or students go restaurants   to enjoy having lunch, but they canÅft enjoy. If smokers canÅft stop smoking while they eating, there are no way without banning. Second, lung cancer is very terrible illness. By taking much smoke into our bodies, we will come to have lung cancer. Now, many people smoke. So, most of them are likely to have lung cancer. Unfortunately, non-smokers also come to be lung cancer by taking smoke which smokers supply. We can avoid the smoke outdoor, but, it is impossible to avoid indoor. I think smokers should be worried about non-smokers. It is serious because this problem is related with our life. Banning smoking at all the restaurants may be able to decrease the number of people having lung cancer.  This is why I think all the restaurants should be completely forbid smoking. 
I think that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. It is because many of nonsmoking people feel the pain when they take smoke of smoking people. And smoking is toxic for the health. If people think they live long, they should not smoke. Smoking people will get cancer because of nicotine and tar which are included in tobacco. And smoke which smoking people give off is more toxic for non smoking people than smoking people. Then smoking people should smoke at space, in which smoking is allowed. Many of my friends are smoker and smoke everywhere but when I frown about it, they stop smoking. Then I think people must note the public manner and each person should be considerate to each person. If they were ignored, each would feel uncomfortable. Smoking people mind the frown of nonsmoking people and nonsmoking people feel pain about smoking. Finally, consideration for each side is most important about this theme. 
 I quite agree with this idea.   First of all, I a nonsmoker dare say that nonsmoking seats is almost meaningless. If a restaurant is big, and nonsmoking seats are separated enough from smoking seats, there is no problem. But such a case is really unusual. Most restaurants have nonsmoking seats which are close enough to smoking seats that smoke of cigarettes easily flow there.  Besides, in the case that there is no seat but a smoking seat, you had better be ready to have your meal ruined. When I sat on a smoking seat and started to drink some coffee at a cafe in the morning before, I come near to shouting, ÅgHow can you enjoy your coffee with cigarettes?Åh Needless to say, breathing smoke of them is nothing but unpleasant. Why do we nonsmokers have to experience such a feeling in spite of paying as much as smokers? I have often wanted to say that they should pay a part of our charge.  There is also a problem about health. It is none of my business that they do harm to themselves. But if they harm to us, I canÅft overlook it. There are people who are sensitive to smoke of cigarettes such as a little child, an expectant mother, a sick man and so on. Passive smoking at restaurants possibly becomes a cause of a serious situation.  ThatÅfs why I support the idea. 
Å@I think that smoking should be completely banned at the restaurants in Japan is very good idea. There are two reasons why I think so.   First, I donÅft like smoking. Of course, I donÅft smoking because smoking has much harm but donÅft have any merit. For other reason, smoking needs a lot of money. At these reasons, I donÅft like smoking. If I donÅft smoking but other people smoking near by me, the smoke may come into my breath. At this, smoking harm not only smoking people but also not smoking people. Now, smoking completely banned at all the university building. So, the same thing can do at all the restaurants.   Second, smoker can smoke at the out of restaurant. If smoker want to smoke, he or she only pay the dinnerÅfs money and smoke at the out of restaurant or in oneÅfs car. Surely, there are smoking seat and non-smoking seat in the restaurant, but the air in the restaurant is a little staled because smoking seat and non-smoking seat are just exist in the same building. And the smoke has bad smell, so that is inconvenient for the person who wants to taste the dinnerÅfs flavor.   For the reasons, I think smoking should be completely banned at al the restaurants in Japan.
I agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. This is because smoking is bad for health. We hear too smoking causes cancer. We often see people eat smoking in restaurants. Restaurants should be comfortable space for us to enjoy eating delicious foods and talking with companions. Even if one person smokes in the restaurants, all the air in the room is polluted by smoke. No one should wish this situation. The idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants is not only for people who donÅft smoke but people who often smoke. People who smoke often contain people who want stop smoking but canÅft stop smoking. In order to decrease the number of the people who smoke often, I think we should decrease the place that gives the chance of smoking. By reducing the time when people can smoke, people who want to stop smoking but canÅft stop smoking get to have the confidence that they can lead their life without smoking. There are many people who often smoke at home or outside, but the number of the people who smoke includes the number of the people who afraid of stopping smoking. We should help such people by supporting them and making the surroundings that people can get to stop smoking easily. 
 Nowadays, there are many people who smoke. If they are banned from smoking, it irritates them in a moment. So many smokers maybe disagree with banning from smoking at the restaurant , but I think smoking should be completely banned at the restaurant . I would like to explain why in the following sentences. First, smoking is really bad for health . TobaccoÅes smoke harm expectant mother and Children who sit beside the smoker by chance. Smoking harm is not only smokerÅes trouble but also non- smokersÅfs . It is very trouble for people who donÅeÇî smoke. Second, smoking often spoil the meal . The smoke is very smell . ItÅes smell spoils the fragrance of meal and people can not enjoy the realÅfs fragrance. Fragrance is one of the most important factor of meal.  What I want to say is that smoking causes many bad things. It is bad for everyoneÅes health and it spoils the meal .So I think smoking should be completely banned at the restaurant in Japan . Besides I also even think that smoking should be banned in the public space .           Å@ 
Å@ I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  I hate smell and smoke of tobacco. I think almost people who donÅft smoke feel it too. So there will be many problems about smoking in the restaurants. First, smoke dirty wallpaper, curtain, and so on in the restaurants. Second, there are possibilities to occur a fire, and children may get burned by their tobacco. Third, because there are people who hate smoking, the restaurants have to separate smoking seats and nonsmoking seats. But because the number of smoking people is smaller than that of people who donÅft smoke, people who donÅft smoke can sit down on the smoking seats. It is unfavorable situation.      The other reason why I think so is that smoking is bad for the health. For example, smoking lead to cancer. It affects not only themselves, but also people who are around them.     I think that it may be impossible to ban smoking at all place in Japan. But the restaurants are the eating place. The smell of tobacco ruins the smell of dishes. And if all the restaurants ban smoking, perhaps the number of smoker in Japan may decrease.    I wish everyone all over the world stops smoking. 
I donÅft agree with smoking at the restaurant in Japan. There are three reasons why smoking should be forbidden at the restaurant. First, after all smoking does harm to you. Smoking causes you illness such as lung cancer. So smoking should be banned.  Next the smoke also causes not only your health but also the environment. The smoke pollutes air and cause various environmental disruption. I think the smoke is out everywhere when you are smoking. So I think Not smoking prevent the environment of the earth not only in the restaurant but also every where.  But Final reason is most important for my opinion. I think smoking may annoy the other people in the restaurant. This is because they directly breathe smoke that you are smoking. The smoke gives bad influence to them. For example, when you will start to eat dish in smoke that the other people are smoking, you will be uncomfortable to have dish because the smell of meal is spoiled and even the atmosphere of meal is spoiled.  So I think smoking should be forbidden at the restaurant so that everybody enjoys having meal. And if possible, anyone doesnÅft smoke anywhere for people and the earth.       
I hope that smoking be completely banned in all the restaurants in Japan. All the managers of the restaurants should not allow their guests to smoke in the restaurant. I have two reasons why I think so.   Firstly, I donÅft like smoking itself. It makes our bodies unhealthy. Our teeth will be stained. We will damage our throat. And, furthermore, the risk that we get cancer in our lung will become higher than those who donÅft smoke. I think smoking brings us nothing but bad things.  The second reason why I hope that smoking be completely banned in all the restaurants in Japan is that those who are near the person who is smoking will never feel comfortable. Smoke will hurt their throat and eyes. Moreover, smoke which other persons breathe in is more harmful than that the person himself breathes in. I felt very discomfort when my friend smoked near me.  So, for these two reasons, I hope that smoking be completely banned in all the restaurants in Japan.    
  I disagree with a opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. To be sure it is said that smoking represents a hundred evils and not a single good.  In fact everyone understands a weak point of smoking.   For example,people who smoke are missing their appetite. Of course littering of a cigarette is out of the question. To make matters worse,the smoke from people's who smoke cigarette make non smokers feel bad.   But even considering their weak points of a cigarette it is too disadvantageous that smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants.   I think that sales at the restaurant decrease if all the restaurants in Jaqpan completely bans smoking. There are some reasons.   First,I think that people who want to smoke after the meal don't want to go to eat to restaurants which smoking are banned.   Second,the seat at a restaurant is filled to capacity for the most part when we go to a restaurant to prepare for a test in the evening.   I think that it is necessary to make a firm barrier between smoking place and non smoking place in order to come true to set up smoking places at restaurants.   This is why smoking shouldn't be banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
I disagree with the statement smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  This is the only an opinion for people who donÅft smoke. For people who smoke, smoking is kind of their lifework. Smoker canÅft live without smoking. Even in restaurants, smoker needs to smoke after all the food came out. For example, in a bar we usually stay even though we finish eating. Smokers canÅft relax without smoking. I think bar is a place we can relax and free to talk. WouldnÅft this statement wrong from the definition of bar?     In the first place, why we have to ban smoking? Because we canÅft eat delicious food with smoke? I know smoking is not healthy for not only smokers but also people next to the smokers. Of course it is bad to involve other people, especially to the non-smokers. So what I suggest is to separate the room for smoking and non-smoking completely. We can see this system in most of the family restaurants in Japan today already. I think this work very well and both smokers and non-smokers are satisfied.     However, in one place I wanted to be banned smoking. It is cafe! Cafe is a place where we enjoy both taste and smell. I think this is the only exception!   
  I think smoking should be completely banned at all public places such as a restaurant, station, theater and college because cigarette smoke includes poison which is dangerous for peopleÅfs health. And the people near smokers are also harmed by the poison of the cigarette smoke. I think there are three important things when the smoking problems are discussed.     First, passive smoking has bad influence on our health. Moreover, itÅfs more dangerous than smoking directly. Smokers might be prepared for the bad smoking influence and give up the idea of keeping their health. But passive smokers never think so. Most of them probably want to keep their health and enjoy their life for a long time. If a woman is pregnant, she should not smoke without question. And the people near her should pay attention to the situation of smoking. It is also dangerous for a baby to breath in the cigarette smoke.     Second, habitual smoking needs a lot of money. So stopping smoking will solve the problem of a family budget. Now, the government in Japan plans a large increase in some kinds of taxes. If habitual smoking is improved, we might overcome such severe situation of a family budget. I think that stopping smoking is to family advantage.      Third, heavy smokers, the people who smoke a lot every day, always have the risk of lung cancer. I have seen the picture of a lung suffered from nicotine. It showed that the lug turned from vivid pink to black by the influence of nicotine. The picture really shocked me. So, I donÅft smoke now and wonÅft do in the future.      After all, it doesnÅft profit us to smoke. Smoking harms both smokers and nonsmokers seriously. That is why smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants.     
I donÅft smoke now. But I donÅft agree with this opinion.  Because I think smoking is one of the hobbies like as sports, reading and  eating. So we canÅft easily interrupt smoking. And now, in many restaurants  there are tables for smoking people and for not smoking people. If you sit  at table for not smoking people, you can run away from annoying smokes.  Therefore, when people who smoke sit at table for smoking people they donÅft  make any bad things. None the less, if there are people who want to  completely ban smoking at all the restaurant, I want to regard them as  people who canÅft understand the free correctly and who are so selfish.  The next reason is like this. When I have smoked, it was a so wonderful time  when smoking after good breakfasts and lunches or when smoking with drinking  a cup of coffee. This time was the one of the best time in my life and I  could feel happy. And I think this is the common time for smoking people  around the world. Therefore I think the restaurants that completely banning  smoking are unsatisfactory for smoking people. And I think the restaurants  should be the one that giving customers perfect satisfactions.  So, I donÅft agree with this opinion.  
I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan, too. At a restaurant if when people who dislike mystify or smell of tobacco come, people around them begin to smoke, they probably feel unpleasant. This spoils their hope to eat delicious dish. And people who donÅft feel unpleasant even if someone is smoking near them when they are eating are few. Rather usually most of people hate it.   As many people know, indeed mystify of tobacco influence people who smoke than people who influenced by second smoking. This is very troublesome problem for people who care a lot about their health and keep off alcoholsÅCtobaccos and so on.    There is a people smoke tobacco more than one case a day that is what is called heavy smoker. Recently smoke ward and city forbid people to walk in the town when they are smoking by ordinance. And so in addition to this if all restaurants forbid people to smoke, smokers may be sorry. But it is clear that to smoke tobacco is not good for smokers and people around smokers, too. And by this chance, I hope smokers will decrease the number of tobacco they smoke a day, keep off smoking at the table and think about their health. 
I donÅft agree with the suggestion.  If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan, some people donÅft be satisfied. My father likes to smoke. So he wants to sit down a seat that people can smoke in restaurants. One day our family planed to eat out near the restaurant. However, we couldnÅft take a meal because smoking is banned in there.  Provided that the member of a family smokes well, they will look for the place where people smoke freely. It is the same things in restaurant. But many people donÅft like a tobacco and people to smoke in recently society. The area that people donÅft smoke in is important because the smoke of a cigarette is worse for our health. Yet it is overdoing that smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants.  The men who run the restaurants should think another way that smoking and no smoking people can go there at the same time. For example, they make a wall between smoking area and no smoking area or buy garbage for ash of the cigarette to absorb the smoke of it. I think it isnÅft only satisfied way for everyone that smoking is completely banned. So I object that opinion.                                                           
I agree with banning smoking at the restaurant in Japan completely.  The most important reason, as you know, is that smoking is bad for health. Addition to the main cause of lung cancer, it causes other else kinds of cancer and lung and heart attacks. It is recently said that smoking might influence to babyÅfs sudden death. A smoker at the restaurant, where various people including babies are, can be called as a murderer.   Secondly there are people who feel bad when they smell tobaccoÅfs smoke.  I work as a part timer at the Udon shop where isnÅft banned smoking. Some of customers smoke. Other customers often ask to me that they want to get the table as possible as away from smokers. And I myself also feel bad, cannot stop cough and disappear appetite. How to feel the smoke is different each other. I think shops must think of a person feel worst.  When it comes to discuss about smoking, somebody absolutely says that people who smoke also have free of smoking. I think this is very fool. Do you have free of killing other people? Do you have free of infecting other people? Almost all human beings will answer NO. But to claim free of smoking is to answer YES to these questions. If owners of restaurant have common sense they must bun smoking completely. (227 words)
Å@ I agree with this opinion. There is one reason.        We should think that restaurants are the place where we eat foods with our family or friends talking with pleasantly over once more. Also all of us should want to eat foods which are delicious. But we canÅft eat the foods by allowing smokers to smoke in restaurants. For example, when I eat the foods with my family pleasantly and the smoke comes, I wonÅft eat pleasantly by the delicious smell was drowned out by the smell of smoke. Actually I experienced the situation like this. When I entered one restaurant with my family, there were only seats in the smoking section. We were forced to sit down seats in the smoking section because there were few times when we looked for another restaurant. Foods had brought. Then the guests who sat around us hadnÅft smoked yet.  When a few minutes had passed, some of them started to smoke. Just then, I smelled the disagreeable odor of the smoke in spite of that I ate delicious foods. And my parents felt loathing for the odor. After that we couldnÅft eat pleasantly and with good taste. I think there are lots people who have ever experienced like this.       In conclusion, I think as long as restaurants are the place where we eat foods pleasantly with good taste, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.                          
I agree with this opinion. At first, smoking is harmful for people. Passive  smoking is more harmful than active smoking. So smokers bother many  non-smokers. Secondly, the smell of tobacco is very strong. And once clothes  absorb the smell, it is difficult to remove the smell. It is an offensive  smell for non-smokers. When I went a restaurant and sat down smoking seats,  my clothes absorb the smell in spite of nobody smoking. The other day, I had  another terrible experience. I sat down no-smoking seats, but smoke came  from smoking seats. And I felt very bad. Smoke spoiled dishes and clothes. I  went back home and wash my clothes immediately. It was very unfortunate day.  Regardless of the separation of smoking seats and no smoking seats, smoke  bothers people. So I think that smoking should be completely banned at all  the restaurants. There is no merit of smoking. Smoke spoils tastes of foods.  Cook donÅft want this result. In order to enjoy meals, smoking should be  banned. I donÅft understand significance of smoking. Do smokers smoke for  relaxation? It is better to find an alternative way of relaxation. Nobody  benefits from smoking. Smoking should be banned at not only restaurant but  also all public space in Japan.                            
I think itÅfs a bad way. There are two reasons why I disagree with this opinion.  First, smoking is a right culture. There are many many people who love smoking and cannot do without smoking. A famous philosopher is said that he must have not been able to make his great theory without smoking. Like this, smoking is a part of their life. I havenÅft ever taken smoke, but I wonder the feeling of a heavy smoker having meal without smoking is as sad as the feeling of us eating Soba without chopsticks. Like the people who canÅft enjoy eating with smoke, there are the people who canÅft enjoy eating without smoke. This is a just difference of cultures. So we canÅft judge which one is right. And restaurants are not places only to have meal but also to have fun. So this opinion is completely ignore smokers, a large part of citizens.  Second, we can choose which restaurant to go. If you hate smoke, you should go to it that doesnÅft arrow to smoke. We can avoid them easily unlike walking smokers. And if we think of smokerÅfs and the peopleÅfs around smokers health, we should take other ways for example increasing the tax of tobaccos or encouraging the restaurants which have only no smoking seats.  To enjoy with all of us, we must give smokers the Åhroom Åh to eat with smoking. 
I agree with this statement. One of the reasons is that many people tend to feel uncomfortable when they eat dinner with smokers. In fact, some of restaurants in Japan make areas that people can smoke, but that is not useful. For example, when my mother and I went to such restaurant, we wanted to eat dinner in the nonsmoking area but we canÅft because that area was filled. We ate in the smoking area, but we felt so bad that we couldnÅft eat dinner very much. Finally, we went out the restaurant. The other day we went to another restaurant, we could eat dinner in the nonsmoking area, but because of smoke from the smoking area we canÅft also enjoy dinner. Another reason is that smoking in the places where many people use such as the restaurant is very dangerous. Sometimes only a cigarette could cause a big fire. Everyday many people eat dinner in the restaurant. Not only adults but also children come into the restaurant. If cigarette that man is smoking touch children, children will burn themselves. Moreover, smoking is bad for not only smokerÅfs health but also the health of other people around the smoker. If we eat dinner with smokers, in spite of nonsmokers we may suffer from a serious disease that is caused by smoking. So, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.   
I disagree with the opinion. It is sure that smoke bothers those who donÅft like it, but you should not only support abstainers from tobacco but also stand by smokers. I think that all the restaurants should have two areas; one is the smoking area and the other is the no smoking area.      Smoking and the smoke are thought to be harmful to you. And also actually the smoke of others is smoky and smelly to you if you arenÅft smoker. So you may say that if you are allowed to smoke in the restaurants, they have many demerits and donÅft have any merits. I donÅft, however, think so. If the restaurants completely ban smoking, they would get abstainersÅf satisfaction, but wouldnÅft get smokersÅf satisfaction and some of them would decide not to go to the restaurants.As a result, the restaurants would share only abstainers. In short, the pie would get small.      To avoid such tragedy, the restaurants should allow smokers to smoke. If, however, they do so, abstainers would get angry instead of smokers. Then, what do the restaurants should do to gratify both of them? I have an opinion. The restaurant should make the smoker sit another to the abstainer on the area. It only has to prevent the originated smoke from reaching the no smoking seat from the smoking seat. If the group that consists of the smoker and the abstainer comes to the restaurant, they only have to decide on which seat they sit for the restaurant.      Therefore, I am opposite to the opinion, and I think that the restaurant should have the smoking seat and the no smoking seat. 
We have got to know about harms of smoking recently, because many media  report it. According to them, there are various harms. For example, smoking is incriminated as the major cause of lung cancer. Another example, when the woman during pregnancy smokes, the embryo  receives a bad manner. And, in addition, smoking decreases in moving ability and the skin  grows old. Smoking after one agrees to these harms is individual freedom and we  donÅft have any right to get them to quit smoking. But in places that an unspecified number of people gather in such as  restaurant, it is necessary to prohibit smoking. Because, as we have already know, those who breathe the smoke that  rises up from the top of cigarette suffer more serious harm than those who smoke actually.It is what is called passive smoking. If people smoke and injure their health, they have no one but  themselves to blame, but it is ridiculous of people who donÅft actually to receive the harms.  And restaurant is the place to enjoy dishes. So it is problem that the  good smell of dishes which chefs made with their whole heart is deaden by the smoke of cigarette. It is bad manner to chefs and dishes. In brief, by prohibiting smoking, more people are able to have a good  time in restaurant. This is why smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants.    
I agree with a ban on smoking in Japanese restaurants. A lot of   people dislike smell and smoke of cigarette. Some of them become   unwell. They donÅft want to meet come across a smoker especially when   they are eating. Account of smoking, a good taste of dishes goes bad.   In restaurants, they canÅft change a place where they are seating.   Since there are people who donÅft trying to think of surrounding   customersÅf trouble, the restaurants themselves should say that we   donÅft allow smoking to make a comfortable place for everyone. A non-  smoking seat or smoking seat has no mean because there is no wall   between them. If two seats are not divided, smoke will spread over   the restaurants.   Smoking also has a big problem in our health. It causes some kinds   of cancers. It is well known that passive smoking does more harm than   direct smoking. May smokers give a hazard to not only themselves but   also others? None of people feels good by knowing that harmful   substances are floating around. This matter ought to be considered.   So the place gathering people like restaurants has to be made a rule   about smoking, which is decided not for smokers but for non-smokers. 
Å@I go to Kobe University by train everyday. Every time I ride in the do or in the front of a smoking are at Shinimamiya station which is on my w ay to the school. When the train arrives there, businessmen with smoke r ide on it. They can extinguish their cigarette but cannot remove their s moke. The smoke is bad smell and does harm to people near the smoker.  S o, I don't like cigarettes and smokers. Most people dislike the smell. T he smoke left the smell with clothes, hair and rooms, and have a big bad  influence on not only adults but children.  Å@The Star backs Coffee bans smoking because the customers can't enjoy t he scent of coffee with smoke.  This instance can be applied to the rest aurant. We go to a restaurant to eat delicious dishes. So, restaurants p rohibit smokers from smoking. If a restaurant makes nonsmoking and smoki ng seats, a group may have to separate into two groups. It costs to desi gn the inside of restaurants and attach exhaust system to there for maki ng nonsmoking area. Therefore the restaurant completely banned smoking.  Some of the many smokers want to quit smoking but can't stop because the y are addicted. This prohibition may be good opportunity.     
Now in Japan when we go to restaurants we often find that most restaurants have a smoking room separated from a nonsmoking room.  If we would like to smoke at the table we should go into the smoking room and if we would not like to we should choose the nonsmoking room.  It is true that smoking is bad for health and troubles nonsmokers, but smoking in this separated room does not give nonsmokers any troubles.  No matter which he is a smoker or nonsmoker, a customer has a right to enjoy his eating in restaurant because he pays charge.  In other words, restaurants have a duty to satisfy their customers.  So restaurants should not ban smoking completely but ban smoking partly; make a smoking room and a nonsmoking room.  In the smoking room smokers enjoy both their eating and smoking, and in the nonsmoking room nonsmokers enjoy their eating without being troubled with smoke.  In fact, it has been a great advantage for restaurants to have a smoking room and a nonsmoking room.  Since smoking on the street became a crime, smokers have needed places to smoke more than before.  It goes without saying that smoking might profit restaurants.  
 Smoking is very bad for health. In America and many other countries, many people are getting sick or have died for smoking diseases. It is because nicotine, which is included in a cigarette, causes lung cancer. When people smoke, they get nicotine with their breath and it collects at their lung. After many years go through, nicotine which costed for many years causes lung cancer. Thus, smoking is very bad for health. In addition to it, smoking is very dangerous not only for smoking people but also for non smoking people. If people smoke, smokes which contain nicotine are produced and are widespread in the air. And by breathing it, people around the smoker get nicotine. Some people say that since the smoke which is widespread in the air contains more nicotine than the nicotine smoker directly gets, people around the smokers may have higher risks to get a lung cancer than smokers themselves have. So smoking is very dangerous not only for smokers but also for non smokers and this is why I disagree with this statement. Because people have a right to smoke and not a few people want to smoke even if there are risks like a lung cancer, I donÅft forbid smoking. However, non smokers also have a right to lead a healthy life. So people may smoke at the private place, but they shouldnÅft be allowed to smoke at the public place. 
In Japan, smoking should be prohibited at the whole restaurant. Because the smoke makes many people feel very uncomfortable. It smells bad. Besides, non-smoking people, especially the children, breathe the smoke. The smoke has very bad effect for their health, and fewer than 20 children are banned smoking by law. It does harm for children's growth. Though they received such infection for only eating at the restaurant. It is foolish. Of course, there are many restaurant that separate non smoking seats from smoking seats. But the smoke moves in the room. Although it is better that sitting on non smoking seats than on smoking seats, sitting on non-smoking seats doesn't mean it is divided from the smoke. Smoking itself is not wrong but bothering other people is really wrong. In public spaces like the restaurants should establish smoking space which separated completely from non smoking spaces for instance out of the restaurant. In these spaces, smokers are allowed to smoke. To do this, most smokers go out of the restaurant to smoke. It is sure that eating at non smoking restaurant is very comfortable for non smoker. Certainly many people hope so. For all the people's safe and comfort, at the restaurant the smoking should be banned completely.
It is often said that smoking is not good for your health. Do you agree or disagree with this? Indeed, smoking causes many kinds of diseases, such as lung cancer and heart disease. Because of tobacco-related illness, around 5 million people die each year.Å@Judging from this, we can say tobacco is very dangerous for our health. Moreover tobacco is harmful not only for the very person smoking cigarettes but also for those who are around there.   So these days, a lot of countries are beginning to prohibit smoking. Similarly in Japan, elementary school and junior high school began to ban smoking in their ground, and most of the public places donÅft allow people to smoke. But not all the restaurants in Japan, where plenty of customers visit every day, ban smoking. It is not reasonable that smoking is not banned at all the restaurants. : Restaurants are the places where various kinds of people gather, of course including those who donÅft smoke. So it is natural to consider if you smoke a cigarette at the restaurant, it troubles no-smokers around you. In the first place, a restaurant is a place where people enjoy meal, not in the least people feel displeasure. We cannot find any advantages to allow people to smoke cigarettes at the restaurants.    In conclusion, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan.      
I really dislike smoking.  It is because not only it smells terribly bad but also it is bad for our health.  I cannot understand the people who smoke though they have already known the fact that smoking does harm to our body.  I also cannot see the reason why some people smoke while they are eating.  When I eat out, I make it a rule to choose aÅenon-smoking seatÅfas I can.  This is because I feel that smoke of cigarette makes dishes not delicious.  With the bad smell, I cannot enjoy their real tastes, and moreover, it sometimes causes me a headache.  Eating is one of my happiest things, so I donÅft want to be interrupted by anyone like this.  However, even if I eat something in a non-smoking section in a restaurant, I sometimes smell smoking from a seat in a smoking section.  It maybe causes because the air in the restaurant stays still and the fresh air cannot come into the room.  It is the restaurant that is to blame for this situation.  So if they cannot deal with this problem, they should completely ban smoking at all the restaurant.  I couldn't agree more with it.  What is more, I hope that smoking is banned all the restaurants in the world, not only in Japan. 
We should permit smokers to smoke at the restaurants. There are three reasons. First, as you know well, it is true that cigarettes do harm to not only smokers but also people around him, but we can prevent that damage. For instance, by setting air-conditioning units, many people wouldnÅft be unpleasant even when there are smokers at the same restaurants. Or, for another, by deciding time or space to ban smoke, the restaurants would be comfortable place for all people. In addition, the manager of the restaurant will get much money than prohibiting smokers from entering their shops because they have larger customers, both smokers and non-smokers. Second, as there are stormy discussions about the tax of cigarettes, the government can get much more money for public welfare from smokers. However, the government couldnÅft do if smokers are not allowed to smoke at all restaurants. Now the economical situation of Japan is very danger, so we should accept their smoking at the restaurants. The tax of cigarettes will help condition of Japan with solving the problem of the pension coming from the aging society. Third, smokers have the right to have relaxing time as well as non-smokers. It is hard for them to find the good place for smoking because many rules that restrain them from smoking are passed one after another. It is cigarettes that smokers can breath a sigh of relief with. We should consider hard condition of them in this society filled with stresses. For the three reasons, we should admire their smoking to make the society comfortable for both smokers and non-smokers.
Å@I disagree with the statement.  Some country seems to have a custom of smoking at dinner, same as even a child. It means that smoking is a good method to be relaxed and enjoy themselves at dinner time.Å@More over, IÅfve heard from my uncle, who loves smoking, that smoking is a tool with which people have a nice dinner and communicate with each other. Indeed we can see people enjoying having a meal and communicating at restaurant in Japan, say, izakaya or so. Though it might be because they are drinking, smoking must help them have a good time.  Restaurants should offer the place where their customers can enjoy themselves and have a meal relaxed, even if someone who doesnÅft smoke insists that the smoke of tobacco does harm than good for him. It is a restaurant that is responsible for solving the problem like this. In other words, the restaurant should divide the seats for non-smoker from those for smoker. And then, both non-smoker and smoker will be satisfied with the mood of the restaurant and taste dishes good. This experience would make them come back there again. In order to have their customers feel like this, restaurants shouldnÅft completely ban smoking.
Smoking makes many people unpleasant in a restaurant. Because of smokers, some people do not enjoy having dishes. At the most of the restaurants, efforts to protect customers for smoke are not enough and even if the efforts would be great, we could not completely extinguish smoke. Though smokers may insist that they should have a right to smoke freely, the right must be restricted for a lot of people. And restaurants are not the place to smoke, but to enjoy having a meal. Managers need to realize a restaurant that all people can enjoy a meal.  That smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan has another good respect. To prohibit people from smoking leads to decrease chances to smoke. Of course, in a bus, train, taxi, smoking is banned. Like restaurants, as the number of places not to smoke is larger and larger, the number of people who smoke is smaller and smaller. It is very good for smokers to give up smoking. It is so bad for our body to smoke. For instance, our brain does not work well, our bone become weak, and smokers will die earlier than people who do not smoke.  This is because to forbid smoking is a great means for both smokers and non smokers. 
I agree with the statement.  I simply hate a smoking person. If he smoke outside,I would permit him.however,in the restaurants we canÅft escape from the smoke,and are going to be forced to do.It is uncomfortable to eat a meal being troubled at harmful matters ,nicotine,and so on.We must consider other people especially at the public places.Smoking should be banned so that everyone in the restaurant can enjoy his or her meal .Some restaurants have places for smoking ,but they are not so useful because  smoke can move freely according to the flow of air.Of cource,I might be too nervous,but anyway ,when someone wants to smoke ,he should select a place not to bother people around him andÅ@harm their health. Though most of us know that smoking is harmful not only for the smoking person,but also people around him,there are many people who canÅft stop smoking.It is free to smoke however often and much.That is his business. He has the right even to become sick,but does not have the right to make people sick. Every time I see smoking person ,I feel bad and wish there were noÅ@tabacco. Now we have many information ,so we ought to use them effectively and be more careful about our health.  
These days, there are more and more places where smoking is banned. This is why many people have got interested in their health because of the progress in scientific research. For example, a scientific research tells us that passive smoking is much more harmful to our body than active smoking. In other words, it is possible for a smoker to make all the people around him ill, lung cancer!     Smoking should be banned at places which many people visit, such as stations, offices and restaurants. But it is not right to ban it completely.    Some smokers think of smoking as an essential deed in their lives :they may think smoking is as important as breathing. If they cannot smoke at restaurant, they may feel unhappy, cannot have happy conversations and cannot take a good rest. It may cause many problems in their work. For instance, a white-collar worker canÅft suggest good ideas on their business and a blue-collar worker canÅft show their full abilities. We donÅft have the right to deprive them of freedom of taking a happy rest...    For another reason, we must consider the loss of products of human culture. Tobacco which originally came from cigar is one of the greatest products of human culture. It has long long history. So, it is a pity that we lose it owning to the excessive bans on smoking.   Of course, it is very important to think about the health of those who around smokers. Smoking may lead them to death. So, we must make systems which allow both smokers and non-smokers to enjoy a happy rest!  
I agree with an opinion that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan . Because restaurants are originally places where we eat some food, but do not smoke. If someone smokes by us when we eat some delicious food, we will be made feel so bad by the smoke. I think the smoke spoil some delicious food. And I think some people who visit the restaurants to eat some food may become ill if someone smokes. Someone who does not smoke is more damaged than someone who smokes, so I think it is unreasonable that some people who pay some money to eat delicious food are damaged by the smoke which is discharged by smokers. After all smoking is forgiven if someone smoke alone putting some distance from other distance, but it is not forgiven when someone smoke in the public places such as restaurants, because it trouble other people and give them the damage. I think that another problem related to smoking is a cigarette end. If someone smokes in the restaurant, the clerks must handle it and it is very dirty. I think it is fatal for all the restaurants. So I agree with the statement that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
Smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  Because smoking provides smokers with felling at ease even if they break themselves by smoking and no one cannot rob them of the ease. They may think smoking is of course harmful but gives good effects to relax. And of course we must consider people who hate smoking or cannot accept smoking in order to protect their health. They may not want to smoke even passively and smoking is solved by stopping smoking. They recommend stopping smoking because it is good for health. In short, both of them have very different policies which are thought right by both sides and smokers will not accept a ban of smoking or non-smokers will not accept smoking. So I suggest that we should completely separate smokers from non-smokers at all the restaurants in Japan. If we do so, Smokers will be able to smoke and get some pleasure and non-smokers will not have to put up with other peopleÅfs smoking. From a point of view of health, smoking should be banned, but from a point of view of relax, it cannot deny that smoking is one of the best thing for some people. So smoking should not completely be banned like my opinion. 
I agree with that statement. First, smoking has bad effect on our bodies. Once we smoke, it makes hard dependence. And they say smoking causes many cancers or any other sickness. It is said that   smoking is dangerous for not only smoker but also no smoker. Some people say smoking is more dangerous for no smoker being near smoker rather than smoker. Second, restaurant is place we eat dinner or so. We enjoy it not only taste but also its smells or looks. When we feel smokes and dinner at the same time, interest to our dinner may be lost rapidly. Smoking makes bad feeling for not smokers but no smoker around them. It is a common thing, smoker smoke carefully, but smokes go to no smoker and make bad feeling. Third, if we make smoking space in Japanese restaurant, we must install machines that let smoke and dirty air go outside of the restaurant. That costs more expensive than making no smoking space. In Japan, it is extending to decrease smoking people. It is not necessary to built expensive restaurant against Japanese present tendency. According to these reasons, I agree with that statement. 
As one of the smokers, I strongly oppose the statement. Most non smokers think that smoking is a bad habit, so they will insist that smoking should be prohibited at all restaurants. But, I think, itÅfs a fool idea. Today, smoking area is separated from non smoking area at most restaurants in Japan. I have never seen a person who is smoking at non smoking area in the restaurant, because he knows that all people around him hate smoking. Some smokers may get out from the restaurant to smoke, but smoking is prohibited in the public place. So, if smoking was banned at all restaurants, smokers couldnÅft eat dinner at restaurant. Then, non smokers should suggest that smokers stand smoking when they are at restaurant. I think it is a hard thing for smokers. People usually go to restaurant or cafe to eat foods, have a break, and chat with friends. Everyone wants to take a rest. Cigarettes must be important for smokers to relax. This statement is a selfish idea of non smokers. They often think they are victims of smokers. Such people donÅft understand the feeling of smokers who choose the smoking area not to irritate non smokers. So restaurants should have the smoking area to save the smokersÅf rights. 
Many restaurants separated smoking area from not smoking area in Japan. But The separation of smoking area is not done completely .Therefore,even if we have lunch or dinner in not smoking area in a restaurant, we sometimes  feel unpleasantness for smoking. But it is not good to prohibit smoking perfectly.  Perfect prohibition of smoking will cause decreasing of profit  from selling cigarette . The rate of smoking person in Japan is big compared to some other advanced country. And young smoking people increase these days. So, if smoking is banned , people who come to the restaurant and sales of cigarette will decrease. This decreasing is severe for many restaurants and Japan. Because, cigarette is one of important source of tax. Of course, separation of smoking area must be done more surely and smoking people may be needed for good smoking manner. Because a thought that passive smoking is bad for health of people  who are surrounding smoker is spreaded all over Japan. However , many people believe this thought whether it is correct or not, they don't think that smoking must be prohibited unless they are in danger ob passive smoking. As far as the separation of smoking area is completely done ,I think that smoking need not to be banned.  
I disagree with this opinion.   It is true that cigarette smoke sometimes annoy another person, but completely banning on smoking at all restaurant is overdoing.  When I had dinner with my friend who smokes, he said ÅgI want to smoke terribly after eating. Most people who smoke feel like this.Åh This remark reminded me that people who have smoking habit often go out of the restaurant in order to smoke after eating. I also remembered that many people use smoking area if the restaurant has this. These facts convince me that his remark is true. In Japan, there are many people who have habit of smoking. So if smoking is completely banned at all restaurants, many people feel ill at ease.  I have another reason. I think it is desirable that there are various types of restaurants .This is because the more types of restaurants there are, the more people can choose restaurants to their satisfaction. They should be able to choose high-class restaurants and low ?class restaurants. In the same way, they should be able to choose restaurants where they can smoke and where they have to refrain from smoking. We should not reduce their choices because it is oppression to do so. When we want to eat dinner without cigarette smoke, we can choose restaurant where smoking is banned. This is also choice.  Therefore I think there can be restaurants where people can smoke.  
I agree with this statement. In Japan, today, more and more people become to have their interest in health problem. Many smokers try to stop smoking and the number of smokers becomes smaller than it used to. Needless to say, smoking is not good for our health. And what is worse, it is said that cigarette is more harmful to nonÅ|smoking people than smokers. Because of these reasons, many restaurants in Japan make nonÅ|smoking seats and some of them already prohibit smoking completely. Of course, there are some opinions that it isnÅft necessary to prohibit smoking completely. They also insist that smokers donÅft smoke in nonÅ|smoking places, so they donÅft annoy other people. But, when nonÅ|smoking seats are full and if the guest hates smoking, there are some troubles. He has to wait until one of the seats becomes empty or put up with smoke and has meals uncomfortably. This situation is common and many people may have such uncomfortable experiences. To avoid this problem, smoking should be completely prohibited in restaurants. When smokers want to smoke, they should go outside and smoke so that everyone has delicious meals and spends comfortable time in restaurants.  
Today, some restaurants remove a seat of smoking section. I agree with this plan. A restaurant is a place for eating foods. In the restaurant which we can smoke, a person disliking the smoke has to endure it during a meal. It is only pain for him to eat such a place. If you weren't a smoker, you would feel unpleasantness in a smoky room when you're eating. Even if it established both a smoking section and a non-smoking section,Å@the smoke has spread all over the restaurants in the end. For another reason, itÅfs given a policy of Japanese government for the past several years. They have assumed a severe attitude toward Japanese smokers. So the smoking population of JapanÅ@have gradually decreased in the last 10 years, and it is said that the smoker of the current Japan is about 27,000,000. I think the restaurant also contributes to decrease Japanese smokers. In other countries, not to mention all the seats prohibition of smoking at the restaurant, it even becomes no smoking space. Smoking is not good for health. It causes some fatal disease. In addition, the smoke gives harm to not only the smoker but also others. I think that Japan learn such countries.     
I agree with the opinion that smoking is banded completely in restaurant. There are two reasons for my insistence. First reason is that cigarette do harm to around people. cigarette consists of a lot of harmful substances. When cigarette is fired, the smoke which contain these substances is exhausted from top of the cigarette. The smoke cause lung cancer. Around people breathe the smoke though they don't want to. I can't understand the behavior which disregard health of other people. It's very egotistic thought. Second  reason is about food. Smell of cigarette is very strong,so it prevent people from enjoying food's flavor. Though chef cook hardly thinking flavor or tastes, smoke spoil them. Final reason is about manner. I think that smoking is bad manner at the place of lunch or dinner. If my partner smoke when I go to restaurant and eat dinner with him I get displeased. I can't think that though they are heavy smoker they can't stand to smoke for only 1 or 2 hours during they eat. If they can't stand to smoke at the table anyway, they should leave the seat and go out of restaurant or go to smoking area. Eventually, by forbidding smoking completely at restaurant a lot of people can spend having lunch or dinner comfortably. Moreover restaurant is one of the places which make a point of food's flavor or taste and atmosphere. Therefore smoker should refrain from smoking at the very least at restaurant.   
I think that they should put a ban on smoking all the restaurants in Japan  As a matter of course, restaurants are the place for enjoying their dishes.  To enjoy dishes means not only tasting their meals but also savoring their good smell.  It prevents them from savoring their dishes to smoke.  Moreover, smoking causes the adhesion of bad smell on their surrounding peopleÅfs clothes, and in addition, smoking makes them feel unpleasant.  WhatÅfs more, smoking, especially smoke from the cigarette causes them bad health.  According to some studies, smoke from the cigarette makes people have a higher risk of developing lung cancer and some heart diseases.  Though it is at their own risks for smokers to lose their health, non smokers also lose their health.  Some smokers say that they have the rights to smoke, and say that forbidding smokers to smoke deprive them of their rights of smoking.  However, they are able to smoke outside the restaurants, so they are not able to say that they are robbed of their rights of smoking.  Therefore, they should prohibit smokers from smoking at all restaurants in Japan in order not to interfere with their savoring their dishes and not to give a bad influence on surrounding people.     
Whenever I go to a restaurant or that kind of place , I need to choose whether I smoke or not . That is to say, there are two types of seats , a seat of smoking and a seat of no smoking, in the restaurant and this is becoming common. However, smoke flows from smoking seat to no smoking seat, so we canÅft escape from smoke in spite of sitting in the seat of no smoking.  According to JT, or Japan Tobacco Inc., about 30 percent of people are smoking in Japan.  That is unbelievable for me, but anyway I hate smell of cigarettes. I canÅft stand that smell, and not a few people are the same I think.  Besides smoking is not good for the health, in addition, smoke by cigarette may cause not only smokers themselves, but also people around to be ill health.  ThatÅfs why it is unreasonable to smoke at the restaurant ! ÅgRestaurantÅh is the place where we enjoy eating. Flavor of the meal comes to nothing because of smoke ! If smokers would like to have a time of smoking after a meal, they should do it out of the restaurant. Nobody will welcome to have a meal with smelling the smoke. I really want smokers to understand that point and not to give trouble to us.  Though it may be severe for smokers, they must not be allowed to smoke in the restaurant, I think.     
I think it is necessary for us to prohibit from smoking in the restaurant. In the restaurant we should enjoy having lunch and conversation and so on. I think it is needless to smoke at this place. Generally speaking, a smoke of tobacco causes lung cancer. I canÅft find the advantage to smoke.    And to smoke in the public place such as a restaurant also influences for nonsmoker. It is difficult to shut off the smoke completely.Å@  For nonsmoker there is no such troublesome thing like this. If we suffer from disease because of otherÅfs smoke, can we allow that we are made to do so?  Of course I canÅft allow them. Recently, people that smoke tobacco have been given a card. The card called TASPO. When we buy a tobacco, we have to show the card. I think this means recognizing the danger of the smoke in the society. If tobacco doesnÅft affect our health, the card is not invented. Restaurant is used a lot of people. But there are not people who take a trouble to smoke. So there is no necessity to provide smokerÅfs room at the place of a meal. ThatÅfs why I agree the statement prohibiting from smoking at the restaurant.
 I agree with this opinion. There are some reasons for this. First of all, the cigarette does the person of circumference unpleasantly. There are a lot of people in a restaurant. Some of them may dislike cigarettes. In Japan, smoking seats and non smoking seats often divided. But it is not enough. When I visited the family restaurant the other day, I saw that smoke of the cigarette move non smoking seats from smoking seats. I feel unpleasantly because I hate cigarettes.  Secondly, the cigarette spoils the cooking. The smell of the cigarette disturbs a smell of the cooking. I think that the smell is a big point for cooking. If smokers donÅft smoke while eating, they will understand true taste of the cooking.  Finally, a smoking rate may fall. It is said that the cigarette is bad for our health. Furthermore it does harm to the person of the circumference. I think that healthy people increase if smoker decrease.   If smoking is banned at all the restaurants, a lot of smokers and cigarette companies will object very much. But there are some countries doing it in the world, and they have good results. Therefore, I am agreeable in this opinion for these reasons.   
I agree with this statement. When we go to the restaurants, the food menu often shows some information such as the foodÅfs calorie and amount of salt, to care about our health, but there are some smoking seats and sometime all the tables have ashtrays. I think this condition is no good. It is a bad manner to smoke while we are at table, and I have heard that as a sensible customer, not smoking at table is one of the international rules and smoking should be done only in smoking room. If someone smokes in restaurant, other customers who donÅft smoke canÅft taste the dishes very well, because breathing smoke makes their taste get dull. IÅfm not a smoker and so are my parents, so when someone begins smoking next to my table, we feel bad. This environment is bad for children, too. It is unfair for the customers who are not smokers to put up with tobacco smoke. If we think of all the customersÅf health including smokers, not smokers, and children, we need not smoking seats anymore. Smokers should go outside when they smoke and try not to have troubles to others so that all of the customers in the restaurant can have a good time.  
The cigarette smoke contains many toxic substances. So, they damage not only smokersÅf health but also other peopleÅfs health. If a person smokes in a restaurant, bad smoke spread over the whole, and visitors breathe these matter. Then, this smoke makes their health bad. Furthermore, the smoke which a smoker doesnÅft breathe, especially, have much more harmful matter. Moreover, many people eat in restaurants. So, smoking gives them trouble.  If they feel uncomfortable and donÅft want to eat there, it is a restaurantÅfs owner who is in trouble. Children, elderly people and pregnant women go to restaurants too. Their bodies are specially weak, so, the tobacco smoke is very troublesome. By the way, the cigarette smoke stinks. This bad smell makes the aroma of foods worst. Many people go to the restaurants to enjoy eating. So, they are disappointed if cigarette smell spoils dishes. I donÅft go to the restaurant which is filled with tobacco smoke. If a restaurant owner doesnÅft want to completely ban smoking, he should perfectly separate smoking area from non-smoking area by using a wall, a ventilator glass and so on. In conclusion, smoking is banned in many places, for example a station, a museum and a theater. So, I think that in a restaurant, smoking should be banned too. (214words)  
I agree with smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in Japan.   Because the cigarette negatively affects our body. The cigarette doesn't negatively affect a person alone who smokes the cigarette. The person in surroundings that breathe in the cigarette smoke is negatively affected, too. Next, I will describe what adverse effect the cigarette gives the body. The most famous is lung cancer. The person who smokes the cigarette with the cigarette smoke becomes easy to become cancer it. Next, I think about woman's case. It is very dangerous that the woman pregnant with a baby in her belly smokes the cigarette. The cigarette smoke is not good for the baby at all. The minor's smoking is not similarly good either. The cigarette smoke has a very bad influence for the human growth. There is no goodness in smoking at young time at all. Therefore, I think that the place where the cigarette can be smoked only has to decrease fast. I think that the smoker situation will decrease in such a place's decreasing, too.   I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in Japan because I consider the above. And I am not going to smoke forever. 
Nowadays, at almost restaurants in Japan, we can choose a smoking seat or a  nonsmoking seat. However, I donÅft prefer this idea. I think smoking should  be prohibited in every seat at the restaurant.    For one reason, smoking is bad for your health in the first place. It is  said that smokers are easy to become lung cancer. If a smoker stops smoking,  he may be able to live much longer.    For another, smoking does harm not only to smoker, himself, but also to  nonsmokers, others. This is called Ågpassive smokingÅh, and nonsmokers are  forced to breathe in smoke from a cigar somebody else is smoking. At the  same time, some people become displeased to see smoking people. It is the  place where everyone enjoys eating out with family, lovers, or friends that  the restaurant should be.    What is more, a large number of children come to the restaurant with their  family. If children see smoking people in the restaurant, they may think  ÅgSmoking is permitted everywhere.Åh This is bad for children educationally.  Parents have an obligation to make their children have good manners in the  future.    For these reasons, I think smoking should be strictly forbidden at all the  restaurants in Japan. Then, everyone can be happy and enjoy eating a  delicious dish at the restaurant.  
 I agree this statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. There are three reasons.  Firstly, it is because that some people donÅft like smoke. Also, people dislike a smell of cigarette. If a man smoked beside them in a restaurant, they would feel like their meal become more awful.  Secondly, it is because that smoking is bad for our health. In fact, a lot of people get cancer of the lungs every year because of smoking. In addition, the cigarette smoke gives bad effect to people who are around a smoker. Surely, smokers have a right which they can smoke, but they should not give people who are around them troubles.  Thirdly, it is because that increasing nonsmoking places in any public places would result that the number of people who smoke and suffer from a disease of the lungs decreases. It is difficult for smokers to quit smoking. As a matter of fact, my uncle tried to quit smoking in the past, but he still smokes now. However, if the number of place where people cannot smoke increased, smokers would be forced to give up smoking and the chance which people can smoke would decrease.  For these three reasons, smoking had better be completely banned at all the restaurants. 
 I strongly believe that smoking should not be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. There are three reasons. One is that there are many causes which disturb others at restaurant. Two is that smoking is a part of life for some people. Three is that problem is solved.   First of all, I will explain that there are many causes which disturb others at restaurant. For instance, if people next to you talk loudly, how do you feel? I think you will feel uncomfortable. However, can we ban talking at restaurant? Of course we can't. If we want to ban smoking, we should ban talking, too, because both smoking and talking disturb others. That's why we should not ban smoking at restaurant.   Secondly, I will explain that smoking is part of life for some people. For instance, most students use mobile phones. They can't spend happy time without mobile phones. No mobile phone no life. Smoking is not different from mobile phone in terms of part of life for some people. So smoking should not be completely banned at all restaurants.    It is true that smoking is bad for health especially for others' health. However in order to solve this problem, there are two different seats at restaurants, seats for smokers and seats for non-smokers. It is enough to solve the problem. So we don't have to ban smoking at restaurant.   From these points, I strongly believe that smoking should not be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan.                 
I donÅft agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.     First of all, nonsmokers are unwilling for a smoker to smoke near them because the smoke of tobacco is harmful to our health. So if there are nonsmoking seats, they would not have any trouble. Fortunately, in Japan, most of restaurants have smoking seats today.  When we enter a restaurant, a clerk always asks us whether we smoke or not. When all nonsmoking seats are taken, we have to wait until a seat comes open or we have to look for another restaurant whose nonsmoking seat is open. But such case is unusual.      Second, smokers have a right to smoke at a restaurant. Banning smoking at all the restaurants is unfair, and it invades their right. If their frustration piled up by not smoking, they might have a traffic accident or fall in something. So we allow them to smoke at all the restaurants, as long as they smoke at a smoking seat. And restaurants must separate smoking seats and nonsmoking seats as much as they can, and change the wind of air conditioners so that the smoke would not go to the nonsmoking seats.      This is why I never consent to banning smoking at all the restaurants in Japan. 
I agree that smoking is completely banned in restaurants. First of all, it is clear that smo king makes human bodies unhealthy. Especially, passive smoking is even more harmful than inh aling smoking. Since a number of people usually stay at a restaurant for long time, they are  forced to receive passive smoking. For instance, though restaurants separate no-smoking are a from smoking area at present, non-smokers must often sit down smoking area in case custome rs in the restaurants are crowded. It is beyond reason.  Secondly, children and elderly peop le are included in those who take advantage of restaurants. Smoking has any bad influences o n them such as growth, some illness, and so on. These influences may bring them to fatal sit uations in life. It is natural that restaurants should avoid it. Thirdly, generally speaking , societies as a whole tend to reject smoking. For example, the number of smoking area has d ecreased. It is illegal to smoke with walking in these days. It is based that a lot of non-s mokers are uncomfortable with smoking. In return, smokers who want to quit smoking have rece ntly appeared. For instance, the goods for no smoking are sold well. This is why smoking should be completely prohibited at all restaurants.
 I agree with this statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. There are a lot of reasons that I think so. For instance, smoking is very bad for our health, it declines our physical abilities, and it costs much money. Smokers have no merit.   Smoking has bad influence upon not only smokers but also non-smokers. For instance, the smell of smoke makes non-smokers feel bad. In fact, I hate the smell of smoke. The smoke of tobacco does not only make non-smokers feel bad but also do harm to their health. It is called secondhand smoking. It has a worse influence upon non-smokers more than smokers. It causes serious illnesses such as cancer and so on. It seems that smokers do not realize that they annoy non-smokers with their actions.   Now campaign against smoking is being held. As a result, the number of smokers is decreased little by little. This is good trend. We should keep decreasing the number of smokers and make a situation that non-smokers can not start smoking easily. I think that even if we cannot ban smoking at all places, we have to ban smoking at all places where there are plenty of people who do not like smoking, such as restaurants and so on. I believe that such actions make a lot of people happy. 
I agree with this idea.  The reason as ground for my opinion is that considering all benefits of smoke, smoking in restaurants isnÅft good but only harmful for people who donÅft smoke.  For people who smoke, smoking in restaurants and cafeterias may give them relaxing and good feelings. It may be natural that when they eat lunch and want to take a rest, they think they want to smoke. And because cigarettes include addictive drugs (nicotine and so), many smoker cannot live without cigarettes.  But, we must check that basically, smoking injure with not only smokers themselves but also people who donÅft smoke.   When one person smokes, people around him who donÅft smoke are likely to absorb more harmful cigarette smoke.  Besides, restaurants are places where people eat lunch and supper.  Smoking in such places indicates that one person makes people around him eat cigarette smoke.  I canÅft imagine how much eating cigarette smoke does harm with people.  And, if ever people of restaurants divide smoke area with no-smoke area, cigarette smoke float. So anyway, no-smokers will be injured.  As far as this fact exists, Smokers must not consider their enjoyment and pleasure but the existence of no-smokers.  Restaurants are places where everyone utilizes ,so to speak, public spaces.  Smokers who use them donÅft have to think only themselves.  So I agree with this idea. 
I think that although smoking is bad for not only smokers but also someone around smokers, smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan for several reasons. First, restaurants are the places where people can rest and so they are able to smoke in the restaurants. Second, these days smorking areas have been too separeted, for example, in planes, in work places, in the Shinkansen. So if restraurants have a smoking area, people can smoke in the smoking area. Third, smoking is a kind of drug. This means that smokers cannot help smoke a lot of times a day. So we have to allow to hold smokin areas in the restaurants. Fourth, I think smoking should be rather completely banned at all the streets in Japan than restaurants. This is because in the restaurants people who do not smoke and are not in smoking area are not annoyed by smokers in smoking area, and smoking in the streets is very dangerous. For example, someone behind the smoker cannot help breathe smoke which the smoker exhale, someone who pass by the smoker can hurt his or her hands ,or his or her clothes can burn. So smoking in the streets should be banned completely. 
I think that forbidding people to smoke at all restaurants in Japan is   very good idea. This is because the smoke could make foodÅfs   tastes bad and a lot of people in the restaurant could be   uncomfortable. I do not smoke, so I do not understand why smokers like   smoking and smoke anywhere. And, smoke of a tobacco is bad not only   for the smoker but also for people who are near the smoker. There are   a lot of restaurants which many families with small children come in   Japan. I think that it is too dangerous for children to be in the   place where it is full of the smoke of tobacco. I heard that smoking   increases the risk of the lung cancer. In addition, the smoke damages   passive smokers more than smoker. It is terrible fact.  Now there are a lot of restaurants which have a no smoking seat in   Japan. Indeed it is a good idea to avoid the smoke. But there are   smoking seats too. I think that it is not sufficient to save people   who do not smoke. That is why I agree with that opinion. Moreover I   request the government to make the rule which forbids people to smoke   at every public places. 
I agree with the idea that we should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  Of course, smokers have the right to smoke, but they should not smoke in the place which smokers may trouble other people. Especially when other people are eating, the smoke makes other people have unwillingness to eat. I change my seat if there is smoker near me when I am eating. Besides, there is another problem. In the restaurant, there is place for smokers and for non smokers. We can choose the room we like to sit down, but in the almost all restaurants, there is nothing to have smoke kept in the room for smokers. As a result, the smoke comes to the room for non smokers. It is obvious that choosing the room is meaningless. Furthermore, cigarette smoke harm people who do not smoke .There are many researches which improve cigarette smoke will cause many kinds of illnesses. It can cause cancer which may kill people. Some foreign countries have already started to ban the cigarette in the public, such as school, station, airport and also restaurant. Japan has to ban smoking at all restaurants, too.  
I disagree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan for the following reasons.  The restaurants are the place where people not only eat the food but also enjoy talking and feel relax.  People who smoke usually wants to smoke every one or two hours.  Also there are people who are looking for a smoke after eating.  Smoking is banned at a lot of places in Japan now, for instance at an office, at a street, in a taxi and so on.  If smoking is completely banned even at all the restaurants, they will get irritated.  In addition, I have watched the news on TV that the staff at restaurants complained, which is in a town forbidden completely to smoke at all the public places.  They said that they had less customers than before smoking is forbidden.  Therefore banning from smoking is not good for the restaurants as well as smokers.  I think that it is enough as long as the restaurants make a smoking section and a non-smoking section.  They don't have to ban smoking.  That is why I don't think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. 
  I think that all restaurants should forbid their guest to smoke, for smoking makes non-smokers annoyed. Furthermore, it influences badly people around smokers (especially children, elderly people, mothers who give their children milk, and so on). For instance, it causes cancer. A report shows that people whose husband or wife smokes have several times more opportunities that they have cancer than those who is not so. Smoking also causes other diseases. To make it worse, sub-smoke that non-smokers have is more dangerous than main smoke that smokers have.    Smoke that comes from cigarettes makes bad smell when smoke is put on clothes. And it is difficult to remove it. The smell is as strong as there are many cleansers that specialized in cigaretteÅfs smell. Some people hate this smell. It is one reason why smokers are hated.    Now, many restaurants divide smoking area and non-smoking area. For instance, in one Moss hamburger shop, smoking area is divided from non-smoking area with a door. So smoke cannot enter non-smoking area. But there are some troubles. Closing completely means that smokers have not only main smoke but also sub-smoke. It is very dangerous!.    Thus, smoking in restaurants has many troubles, so I am for that restaurants prohibit it.
Å@I agree with this idea, because I think that smoking is an annoying act in a public space. Smoke of cigarettes smells stinky. Whether smokers notice about that or not, non smokers bother its scent. It is really unhappy to eat in stinky smoke which smokers make, and at the same time the scent sticks with our hair and clothes strongly. We canÅft get free from it, until we wash up all. That really annoys us.  Everyone knows that smoking is not good for health. People have poor circulation of blood by smoking, and it causes a lot of diseases like an irregular pulse, a cancer of lung and so on. Even more trouble thing is that it can harm not only a person who smokes, but also many people who are around him or her. It effects badly to especially children who only have organs which not completely developed and we have to care about those delicate children.  The idea of this makes a comfortable life for non smokers and it makes a healthy life for smokers. To considerate these bad and good aspects of smoking in a public space, the government of Japan should prohibit it at all restaurants in Japan.  
  I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the  restaurants in Japan. There are two reasons why I agree this. First,  smoking is very bad for not only smokersÅf health, but also non  smokersÅf health. From adult to child, even pregnant motherÅfs baby, we are always faced with danger. Tobacco fumes cause various diseases.  For instance, lung cancer, stomach cancer, heart break and so on.  These diseases are very bad for our body. There is possibility that patients who have got these diseases will die because of these  diseases. Non smokersÅf possibilities of getting these diseases are higher than smokersÅf. So, smoking should be banned at all the  restaurants in Japan to protect from bad fumes.     Second reason why Iagree this is that Japanese smokersÅf manner is too bad.   There are alot of cigarette ends everywhere. Cigarette ends are one of the causes which invite environmental problems. Tobacco fumesÅf smell is too bad. We canÅft eat dishes deliciously because of bad tobacco fumesÅf smells. Even if restaurants divided tables into smoking seats and non smoking seats, we probably feel bad smells. So, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan.     In this way, Iagree that we should completely ban smoking at all the restaurants. If this realizes, we will be able to eat dishes comfortably atrestaurants in Japan!  
These days I read a newspaper that says the numbers of people who smoke are decreasing. One reason for this is that the price of cigarette is rising. Second reason is more and more people understood the danger of smoking. We can say today you are hard to smoke. I think that you should not smoke in public place. There are three reasons for this. First, smoking makes you unhealthy. After all, smoker gets cancer more easily than non smoker. It is not too much to say that cigarette may kill you. Second, smoking makes not only you but also other people bad health. This is what we call passive smoking. There are a lot of people in restaurant. If you smoke in restaurant, other people feel uncomfortable. If other man often smokes near me in restaurant, I feel angry and unpleasant. So, I agree with the idea that all restaurants forbid to smoke. Third, cigarette smoke pollutes the environment. Cigarette smoke includes plenty of bad things. They must pollute the environment. Some countries already begin to forbid to smoking in restaurant. I think we should learn the attitude. Cigarettes have no profit. We should recognize it and build peaceful life.   
People are banned from smoking at some restaurants. I think that it is a good idea. This is because smoking do harm to many people at some aspects. First, smoke of cigarettes causes healthy damage. Even if people donÅft smoke at all, they may suffer from lung cancer in the future by breathing in smoke of cigarettes. Recently, many seats at restaurants are separated smoking seats and no-smoking seats. In that situation, however, the clerks breathe in smoke of cigarettes, and customer near the smoking seats are also affected by it. Second, many people dislike the smell and the dirty of cigarettes. In fact, I dislike it. When I take a Shinkansen, I am sometimes annoyed by it. The smell of cigarettes sticks not only to smokerÅfs clothes but also to other peopleÅfs clothes. Moreover, it sticks to seats, curtains, table covers, and so on. If customers who donÅft like cigarettes smell it, they will be uncomfortable. In addition to it, the dirt of  cigarettes ruins an atmosphere at the restaurants. The clerks there have to clean more carefully to make the customers comfortable. Accordingly, I think that it is a good idea to set smoking room. In that case, nonsmokers arenÅft damaged by the smoke of cigarettes. People can enjoy eating at restaurants under the great circumstance.
I agree the idea which smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  Smoking is bad for your health, you know.  So, if you smoke, it influences people around you by passive smoking.  Passive smoking means nonsmokers lose their health by otherÅfs smoke.  According to the survey, if parents are smokers, their children will have worse health than children whose parents are nonsmokers will in the future.  However, even if someone makes effort to keep his or her condition by nonsmoking, he or she may lose his or her health by smokers around him or her, sitting next to smokers in the restaurants for instance.  And, what was worse, nowadays, the number of smokers who cannot obey the rule about smoking in public has increased.  Someone smoke in the nonsmoking area without thinking other people.  They seem to be indifferent about how other people have trouble by their smoke.  In these reason, I think that the rule about smoking should be more and more strictly.  The most important thing which we should think immediately is to keep everyoneÅfs health good.  So, I agree that we should make the law which prohibits smoking at all the restaurants in Japan.  
Now that in Japan everywhere we go, we can hardly find a place where people can smoke.  And if we enter a restaurant, we often see a situation that a lot of people wait for nonsmoking seats in spite of smoking seats are vacant. I think the situation indicates   That a large number of people dislike cigarette smoke and itÅfs bad smell.  It is unendurable for them who donÅft like cigarette to have a food in smoke and smell.  Now everyone knows smoking have harmful effects for our body, lung and heart and brain and so on. If you smoke a cigarette, you become a bad condition and you canÅft become a healthy condition. Those effects affect not only smoker but also nonsmoker. And if you smoke while you are still young, you may be able to give up smoke.   No one welcome to suffer from illness or die of illness for smoking.  Smoking is no good and only do harm.  Accordingly the entire restaurant in Japan doesnÅft have to prepare smoking seats for smoker and nonsmoker.  And because of people canÅft smoke in restaurant, smoker may give up smoking little by little. I think all restaurants in Japan should ban smoking entirely.     
Recently it seems that smoking is really dangerous thing, not only smokers but also people around them. Above all ÅgPassive smokingÅh, it means to get the harmful thing from the tobaccoÅfs smoke, has attracted considerable attention. In fact tobacco contains the cause of the cancer. And moreover tobaccoÅfs smoke has also serious thing for human health. So passive smoking is a matter of life and death. Therefore we shouldnÅft ignore this problem.  And furthermore, please imagine the todayÅfs situation of each restaurant. Surely many restaurants divide the area, smoking or non-smoking, but itÅfs totally meaningless. Because even if we donÅft want to seat in smoking area, but if the non-smoking area is full and we have no time to wait, sometimes we have to seat in smoking area. And of course children or pregnant women   also use restaurants. Especially smoking is dangerous for such people, but under such situation they must be exposed danger.  Restaurants are used everyday by various people. So this case is different from others. It is certain that smoker has also the right to smoke freely. But this problem is related to the peopleÅfs life. Therefore even though we repress the smokerÅfs freedom, we must keep good environment of restaurants for all people.
Smoking should be completely banned at the restaurant. First, smoking does harm to non-smoker. If your family smokes, you can prevent passive smoking. For example, you tell your family not to smoke in your house, you open the window. But you can Åft avoid passive smoking in the restaurant. It turned out that smoke does much harm to nonsmoker than smoker. If you are pregnant woman, smoking does much harm her. Moreover, passive smoking in the public space, smoker doesn Åft take the responsibility for their smoking. Non-smoker has to accept passive smoking. It is not too much to say, smoker is murderer. In fact, more than 1000 people have died due to passive smoking. It is clear smoking is harmful to non-smoker. It is incomprehensible that smoking is allowed at the public space. Smoking has a bud influence upon not only their health but also their feeling. If you are non-smoker, smoke makes you unpleasant. Besides, you would be at the table at the restaurant. You may be not able to enjoy your food because of smoking. In the public space, non-smoker Åfs charge and smokerÅfs charge are equal. It is unfair that only non-smoker is unpleasant. Thus, smoking bothers many people. Smoking at the restaurant should be banned immediately.  
I agree to this idea. I think Japanese government should prohibit smoking at all the restaurants in Japan. I hate smoking. Smoking is bad for the health. I want to be sure to take good care of myself. And if someone smoke by me, my clothes get smell. I must suffer from my clothesÅLtobaccoÅLs smell. If someone smoke at the table, it get me more irritant. I like to eat, so, I want to eat in comfortable situation. Tobacco makes this situation and mood bad. Because of like these reason, I disagree to smoking at the restaurant. If it is allowed, I want to prohibit tobacco it self. For example, if the government impose a more high tax on tobacco, there are few smoker in Japan. I think, when smoker want to smoke, they should go the place there are no people. So the government should increase smoking room by tobaccoÅLs tax. If  it come true, we donÅLt have to inhale tobaccoÅLs smoke. But it is true that there are many people love smoking. So if they that there are want to smoke, I want to them smoke where not cause us annoying. I want the Japan to be the cantury where the air is clean and not float bad smells. 
Nowadays, as many people notice that smoking has a bad influence on not only smoker but also others, smoking is banned at many places and smokers are forced to go special smoking lounge when they have a smoke. This case is applied to the restaurant. Smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I have three reasons to support my opinion.   The first is that the smells of tobacco disorder our taste. We use our taste and smell for enjoy eating. For example, if you feel dreadful smell when eat your favorite food, you ought to lose your appetite. The smell of tobaccos is nothing but stink for nonsmokers.   The second reason is that smokers make flow of customers bad. Most people get out of the restaurant straight after their meal, but smokers begin to take a whiff after that. Smokers have confined space to smoke, so they try to enjoy smoking when they can.   The Third reason is that it is hard to endure smoke for employee who is nonsmoker. Even if they hate smoker, since they are employee, they must service.     It goes without saying that restaurant is where we enjoy eating or drinking. There are not places for smoking. If you want to have a smoke you should go smoking areas.      
Smoking should be perfectly prohibited at all the restaurants. So there are many people who mind cigarette smoke. And another thing cigarette smoke includes poisonous matter. Because of the matter, people who are not connected smoking will get a cancer. Smoking has many faults. Smoking place should be insulated with the place where we have a regular life. As a result, our life will be livable. Furthermore, government should impose tax on each pack of cigarettes. As a consequence, the cigarettes should be priced at 1000 yen. If the price is 1000 yen, many people will quit. And government can get yield of tax. Because a long spell of smoking wields an important impact on their body and cigarettesÅf price is a burden on each person, no smoking is highly elated. Smoking people should draw on various new pills that claim to help stop smoking. Above all, ÅgnicotettoÅh is very famous one. We only stick the pill on ours body, we can quit smoking. By doing this, could vary in effectiveness, any smoking people can quit smoking. Though my opinion would be cruel and sorry to trouble seller of cigarettes, everybody in the word should be banned smoking the entire public place except the permissive place.  
I think smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurant in Japan.     Most people in Japan have known the serious harm of smoking , such as cancer of the lungs , but in fact there are many smokers in Japan. Of course smoking is no good for our body , but for heavy smokers ,I think that life without cigarettes is nothing other than pain.     If smoking was banned at all the restaurant in Japan , smokers would be under great stress , because many people go to restaurants not only to eat dishes but also to take rest . SmokersÅf rest means Åghaving a cigarettesÅh.       I do not smoke. And I feel irritated when IÅfm in a secret room and other person in the room start to smoke. But even so , itÅfs not right to take smokersÅf rights away.       I think it is desirable to make smoking area and non smoking area more strictly at every restaurant. There are already smoking room at restaurants , but it is not enough. Smoking area and non smoking area should be separated more reliably. By doing so , smokers and non smokers will be able to go to restaurant without any reservations. 
 Most people go to the restaurant to have meal. They donÅft go there to smoke. If some people are smoking at the restaurant, others wonÅft be able to enjoy eating. The smoke make many people feel so bad. For example, when you enjoy expensive wine, the taste and flavor will be spoiled. When you have French cuisine, they lose its flavor. People in the restaurant want to spend good times with foods and drinks, but smokers may interrupt them. Smoking is also harmful for our health. And as we know, that is not only bad for smokers, but also bad for people who are around smokers.  In fact, most restaurants have restricted smoking in America. This shows American admitted that smoking at the restaurant has bad effect on customers. Of course, in Japan, non smoking restaurants are slowly increasing.  Please imagine when you go to the restaurant with your family. If customers around you are smoking, you wonÅft be able to enjoy your dishes. And the smoke has bad influences for your family. Can you endure such a situation? You canÅft endure, can you? If smokers want to enjoy cigarettes, they shouldnÅft come to the restaurant. People want to enjoy the flavor of dishes , not the smell of the smoke.
Recently, it has been gradually increasing of persons who hate smoke in Japan. So, smokers are feeling kind of loneliness by opinions of people who dislike smoking. It is true that smoking causes a lot of disease rather than non smoking person. But smoke or not smoke is completely free and a right of every adult has. Smoking should not be prohibited at all the restaurants. Of course, non smoking personÅfs rights also have to be considered. Restaurants can do many things to avoid smoke for the persons who donÅft smoke. For example, I have seen a vacuum machine at a smoking allowed table of a restaurant a few years ago. There was not smoke, and customers were enjoying eating both smoking and non smoking man. On the one hand, to apart smoking space is good and easy action that almost all restaurants can do. Nowadays, not only to apart from smoking place, but also there are  walls on the hedge of seats. One important thing is to understand the other personÅfs mind. Smoking effects another PersonÅfs health directly. So, when you smoke, just ask for a permittion to people who  There is. And non smoking person should consider smoking person. 
The smoke of tobacco has a bad effect on the health not only for those who smoke, but also for those who donÅft.Nevertheless, there are many people who smoke to relax themselves and they smoke everywhere. It is not desirable that people who donÅft smoke are harmed by people who smoke.So it is the best way to ban smoking by law.But it is expected that heavy smokers will intensively react against the regulation and the tax of tobacco will not exist if government prohibits that people smoke.In this situation, it is the second best way to separate those who hate the smoke of tobacco from those who like smoking.This idea can apply to the problem whether restaurants in Japan should completely prohibit for the customers to smoke or not.To ban smoking perfectly leads the decrease of customers who want to smoke there.But allowing them to smoke wherever in the restaurants makes the customers from having a meal there.Therefore it is good that the restaurants provide where the customers can smoke and where smoking is banned.In this case, it is important to divide two spaces completely in order to prevent smoke from moving from one space to another space.These effort make both of these type people feel comfortable when they meal in the restaurants.  
Today, the Japanese government is seriously considering that it is going to establish the new law determining that the price of a pack of cigarette is a thousand yen. And, I really agree to it. This is because I do not like the smell of the smoke of cigarette, and I think the law makes the number of smoker smaller. In fact, however, it goes without saying that a large number of people love smoking and smoke everyday, and cigarette is indispensable for them. And, we have to accept the fact that we can not regulate cigarette strictly. If all the restaurants in Japan start to ban smoking there, in which not all people are able to have a good time, and some people feel like going out sooner. Thus, it is likely that the number of people who go to restaurants will decrease gradually. Of course, this situation is not good for restaurants at all. So, I think all we have to do is to separate the room into two areas, smoking area and no smoking area, though this has already been in effect at almost all restaurants. In addition to this, smokers should keep the manner of smoking. And by doing so, no problem should happen. 
Å@Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Å@At first, I will talk about the character of a cigarette. Recently, many people dislike smoke of a cigarette. Although some people like it very much, another people donÅft like it because the smell of it is characteristic. Moreover, it is said that the smoke which flows from the cigarette that other people smokes does us harm, so this becomes another reason many people hate the smoke of a tobacco and more and more people get to avoid the smoke. So, tobacco is a thing which makes some people uncomfortable. Å@Then, I will talk about the nature of a restaurant. Restaurant is the public place. In other words, it is the place where various people use. Among those who eat dinner in the restaurants, it is expected that there are many people who get unpleasant when they smell the smoke of a cigarette. In the public place, we should not allow people to do the behavior that makes other people unpleasant. Especially, we donÅft want to be disturbed when we enjoy eating in the restaurant.  Å@That is why I agree that smoking should be completely prohibited at all the restaurants in Japan. 
All the restaurants should stop customers from smoking. There are some reasons for this.    First, smoking has already banned at many stations, schools, and hospitals, where a lot of people come. This is because the smoke causes very harmful effect on the health. For example, it could make it easy to have some cancer. Moreover, the effect is not only on people who smoke but also on people who donÅft smoke, so restaurants have to protect this people from the smoke.   Second, smoke prevents customers from enjoying dishes.  Many customers donÅft come just because they want to make their stomach full. They also come there in order to enjoy the taste and the good smell of the dish, but if someone start smoking in the restaurant, the restaurant become full of the bad smell of the smoke, so the good smell of the dish would disappear. Moreover, people who donÅft like the smoke feel really uncomfortable.  Like this, many people canÅft become relaxed because of the smoke.   Third, if all restaurants in Japan begin to ban smoking, the number of people who smoke would decrease, because they feel that it is more difficult to find the place where they can smoke than now.   As I said, all the restaurants should decide to ban smoking as fast as possible.
There are many smokers in Japan, but there are non-smokers, too. In general, passive smoking is worse than active smoking by a few times. Even if a restaurant divides smoking areas and non-smoking areas, smoke flows to non-smoking areas sometimes, makes non-smokers feel bad and hurts health of everyone. Non-smokers are surrounded by smoke against their will and they get their health bad more easily than smokers, which is terrible. Restaurants are existing for eating not for smoking. In addition, all non-smokers should wait for non-smoking seats being available even though smoking seats are vacant. It is not a solution that non-smokers should put up with smoke. In the first place, it is very strange that there are seats preferred that probably hurt health in restaurants. Many people do not think that they want to hurt their health in the restaurants. Rather, smokers should avoid smoking in restaurants. I wish that smokers had a little more patience with their smoking when we had some food in restaurants. Stopping smoking is the best way to enjoy food, because after quitting smoking, people feel food more delicious than before. So, smoking must be completely prohibited in all the restaurants, not preferring smoking areas.
I donÅft like tobacco, so I never smoke. I think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. It is well known that smoking has a big risk causing some disease, for instance rung cancer. Not only a person who smokes but also a person who is near a smoker might be influenced by smoking because of its smog. It is a very serious problem that a person who does not smoke is influenced by smoking. It isnÅft necessary to smoke at the restaurant. When he or she wants to smoke, he or she can smoke outside before or after eating. The smog of smoking, as I said, has a bad influence for our health, and furthermore, some people feel the smog uncomfortable. If all of people smoke or all of people donÅft mind the smog of smoking, of course everyone doesnÅft have to hesitate smoking at the restaurant. There are many people, however, who hate smoking including me. Such people will be very annoyed if there is a person who smokes during their dinner. In order not to annoy such people, smoking should be completely forbidden. It seems that people who smoke might feel bad if smoking is banned at all restaurants. By forbidding smoking at the restaurant, however, many people can eat without feeling uncomfortable.   
Smoking in the restaurants makes people uncomfortable. When non-smoker goes to a restaurant with a smoker, he should have a meal in smoking area. In the area, non-smokers have no choice but to endure the smoke while eating. Smokers may enjoy eating and smoking after their meal. However, non-smokers cannot enjoy their meal because of smoke around them. Smokers should refrain from smoking in the restaurant for non-smokers. Restaurants are closed space, so smoke generated in smoking area eventually comes to non-smoking area. The smoke coming from smoking area ruins dinner time. It is no use separating smoking area from non-smoking area. Some people in non-smoking area may get angry unless smoking in the restaurants is banned. According to some medical reports I have read, smoking increases the risk of developing the lung cancer in the future. Passive smoking also does. The younger smokers are, the higher the risk is. There must be many children accompanied by their parents in the restaurant. Even though they are in non-smoking area, they may be attacked by smoke coming from smoking area. We have to prevent children from developing the cancer because of passive smoking. It is very efficient way that  people are prohibited to smoke in the restaurant.     
In restaurants, we eat and enjoy dishes which are the works of cookers, but the smell of smoke will interrupts us from tasting. Smoking actually damages the sense of taste, so honest cookers shouldnÅft smoke. Smoking is just harm for guests and cookers in restaurants. In some restaurants, smoking is partly banned, but it canÅft be a solution, because smoke move and spread. However some restaurants may admit smokers to increase their income, they will realize that in terms of economy smoking has demerits. Some nonsmokers will prefer the restaurants which smoking is completely banned. Smoke makes the wall, desks, chairs and etc dirty in restaurants. Without smoke they will save money for cleaning or buying new goods. Though it seems to be difficult to completely ban smoking in the all restaurants in the past, the trend is changed and people tend to prohibit smoking. This is because researches clearly show that smoking does harm not only smokers but also others around them. Furthermore, it is cleared that people who breathe in smoke from smokers are more damaged than them. So, smoking should be completely banned wherever others are, however smokers love and are addicted to smoking. In terms of the health and wealth of people, smoking are nothing but evil.
Nowadays, a lot of people pay attention to smoking. Smoking makes some people unpleasant and even unhealthy. So the government makes some rules. We must not smoke in some stores, streets and schools. Especially smoking in store is taken notice. Some people disagree with it, but it is very good for most of us to make it. I think so, too. Because smoking doesnÅft bring useful thing for me. Moreover it brings bad things. For instance, first we spend a lot of money for cigarettes. A person who smokes ten cigarettes in a day spends about 5 thousands yen in a month and 60 thousands yen in a year. Second we also are likely to take serious disease, cancer and stroke, by smoking. This is proved medically. It is very dangerous for not only smoking people but also people who are around smoking people to smoke in narrow place ,for example in store. Third, there are a lot of garbage by smoking. Lastly cigarettes smell very bad. In the narrow store, the smoke is shut down and it smells but much more. If the government makes a rule which ban from smoking on all stores, these things is better and some people may stop smoking. So I agree with banning from smoking on all stores.  
 These days, many restaurants in Japan divide the seats into two type seats, smoking seats and non-smoking seats. As you understand by this fact, most of non-smoking people hate that others smoke by their seats while eating. To enjoy eating and taste of meals completely requires your mouth, nose and eye. However, people cannot feel that the smell of their foods is good if there are smoking people in nearby their seats because the smell of cigarette smoke defeats that of dishes. In addition to, the smoke makes a lot of things dirty, such as clothes of people and tables or walls of restaurant, and the smell of tobaccos is left in the restaurants by people smoking a bunch of time. So, smoking affects not only people present there but also restaurants themselves customers who will visit the restaurant after a person smoked. Besides, smoking does harm to your health whether you smoke or a person around you do. That is why any people should refrains smoking at restaurants. Sitting on a non-smoking seat nearby a smoking seat is no different from sitting on a smoking seat. So, the beat solution is to prohibit smoking at any restaurants in Japan.
It is a remarkable topic in various aspects. To smoke is only bad for the health and not good every elements. Also, smoking in public place as restaurants, station and school make people around them passive smoking. Smoking is hurtful to the health for not only smokers but also other people. In restaurants, there are some children and they are influenced by passive smoking easier than adults. In addition, passive smoking is more harmful than direct smoking. And there are some people who do not like tobacco so ban to smoke in public place is needed. Because today there are nonsmoking seat, but nonsmoking seat are very near from smoking area. This division is not able to prevent nonsmokers from passive smoking completely. Certainly it is free smoking or not smoking, but to ban smoking in some place have smokers pay more attention to others. And restaurants are originally the place where we enjoy eating. If people are made passive smoking and they feel it complaint, they would not be enjoy the meal and they might feel taste bad or not good. Because customers who come to restaurants paid money, they have a right which they are able to spend comfortably.  
Recently, taspo has been introduced in vending machine so as not to make young people smoke. This means that smoking is bad for them. In addition, a smoking man does harm to his near people with secondhand smoke. There are children as well as adults at restaurant. Although many restaurants have smoking seats, the seats and other seats are not separated. As a result, consumers cannot help breathing cigarette smoke. Some consumers at the restaurants hate the smoke. Restaurants are the place where we enjoy eating. For example, if people who donÅft like cigarette smoke breathe it at a restaurant, they canÅft enjoy eating and feel very bad. This is a disadvantage for the restaurant and for consumers. If I were restaurant owner, I might hesitate to ban smoking at all seats. ThatÅfs because when a man who is a heavy smoker comes to a restaurant, he may be angry for banning smoking and eventually never come to visit the restaurant. Then he will go to restaurants that are allowed smoking. If smoking is completely banned by the law at all restaurants in Japan, I donÅft hesitate to have consumers ban smoking. Smokers will give up smoking at restaurants. Smoking not only gives no benefits, but does much harm. No smoking at the restaurants will have great benefits to many people.  
Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.The first, this is because smoking is bad for not only smoker's health but also passive smoker's health.For instance,smoking cause cancer.  Even though nonsmokers do not sit at smoking seats , they must be done harm from smoking seats more or less.  So , especially families with children are troubled with smoking at restaurants where have smoking areas.  Also , people who dislike smoking do not want to go in these restaurants.  As a result , having smoking seats makes people unpleasant. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan so that all of the restaurant clients can enjoy eating.  The second , smoking has a bad influence upon environment. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan , the rate of smoking in Japan decreases fairly. That is to say , banning smoking in restaurants protects environment.  It is most important for human beings to protect environment as it is today and improve environment. Banning smoking is one of the way of doing it. Besides decreasing the rate of smoking in Japan can be linked to a drop in the death rate which is due to smoking. For these reasons , smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
Now that both smoking and second-hand smoking are well known as the major cause of lung cancer, all the smokers should try to quit smoking.  Many people hate a smell of the tobaccos, and the smell gets some people to feel terrible.  A friend of mine in Nagoya also gets stomachache just to smell the smoke.  In fact, the case of me, I donÅft get bad feeling by smelling the tobaccos and itÅfs not that I hate smoking. To tell the truth, I like a smell of smoking very well.  But much of my friends donÅft like it and I know the news of lung cancer, so I will not smoke again forever.  Besides, I think, smoking interrupts.  For example, when you have a dinner time surrounding good smells, the nice meal will be destroyed and we will feel as if the taste of good meals will drop down because of the smell.   Of course I want to eat the dinner at a good environment for having meals.  Exactly itÅfs up to us whether to smoke or not, but we have the duty to provide other people with the comfortable environment. We never annoy someone.  This thinking is close to the concept negative externality in economics.  In other words, just because a smoker has the time to smoke tobaccos outside the restaurant, people having the dinner inside the restaurant get the nice meal and smoker have the chance to smoke openly. So utility of all the people will maximize.  Therefore smoking should be banned inside the restaurants, but should not be outside the restaurants.   
I agree with this statement because there are two reasons. Firstly, a cigarette does harm not only smoker, but also people that are around smoker. And secondly, smoke disturbs comfortable eating time.   It is said that smoking shortens smokersÅf life. Person who often smokes is likely to get severe disease, for example cancer, and die in his early age. If someone smokes in official space like a restaurant, smoke of cigarette spreads around smoker, and people around him are also damaged from cigarette. Unfortunately, harm which people around smoker receive is much bigger than harm which smoker receives.    Bad smell also spreads during smoking. For smoker smell of cigarette may be good, but it is quite bad for nonsmoker. Smoke makes nonsmoker uncomfortable. At restaurant many people, from children to senior, enjoy eating dishes. They are enjoying both tasting and smelling nice foods. But with smoke, they canÅft enjoy special eating time perfectly. Smoke prevents nonsmoker from smelling delicious foods.  Like this, smoking causes trouble to many customers who donÅft smoke. So Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Smoker should smoke in private space, should not smoke in official space where there are many people who donÅft like smoke. 
 I  disagree with this opinion,I have three reasons.  First, at restaurant, everyone should enjoy spending time whether he or she is smoker or not. They spend money to enjoy eating, no one should interrupt them. If the restaurans make all customers happy, restaurants should set the seat for  smokers to prevent none smokers from smoke of cigarette. For example, they should install some machines which can clear air or rooms separated from other rooms for none smokers.  Second,if we ban smoking at all the restaurants, smokers will not go to restaurants so often. As a result, restaurants loose a lot of customers and decrease their benefits. It is not good for restaurants.  Third, why we should ban smoking at ÅgallÅh the restaurants? If you do not like smoke, you should go to restaurants which ban smoking. We don Åft need ban smoking at all restaurants. There are many restaurants in Japan, if the restaurants which supply what you want to eat do not ban smoking,  you can find other restaurants which ban smoking. From these reasons, I am against the opinion. It is violation of the rights of smokers to ban smoking at all the restaurants . 
I agree with the idea of banning smoking in the restaurant.  I have some reasons.    Smoking is very harmful for us.  First, smoking people are more likely to have the lung cancer than non-smoking people.  The smoke of tobacco causes not only lung diseases, but also other diseases like heat and brain diseases.  Second, the smoke from tobacco also influences to people who are nearby a smoking person.  So even if we dose not smoke, we are always in the risk of a lot of diseases caused by the smoke when there is a smoking person near us.  And more, the tobacco smoke prevents children from growing well.  Restaurants are often visited by many people including families with children, so people should not smoke in the restaurant.    Next is a very important reason.  Recently in Japan, many restaurants have started to divide the space into two parts; for smoking people area and for non-smoking people area.  But in many cases, the imperfect wall between two areas allows the smoke to go to the non-smoking area.  People in the non-smoking area feel very uncomfortable.  This is so bad situation.  So restaurants should make a perfect smoking room or should forbid people to smoke completely.  But if a perfect smoking room is made, it may cost a lot of money, so the best way is banning smoking in the restaurant.    For those reasons, smoking in the restaurant should be totally banned. 
I agree with this idea. I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I have two reasons why I think so.  First, there are the facts that smoking is bad for our health and that side-stream smoke is more harmful than mainstream smoke. These facts mean that smoking is the problem not only for smokers themselves, but also for non-smokers. More specifically, non-smokers heavily suffer from smoking than smokers. Even if they try not to smoke, non-smokers suffer from harmful side-stream smoke, as long as they are near smoking people.  Secondly, we have to think about what kind of place restaurants are, especially about the users. Many various people use restaurants, including little children, the old, the weak, and people who hate smoking. For such people, smoking is unbearable.  As the result of the above, protecting non-smokers from side-stream smoke is the most important thing, and smokers should always care that thereÅfre many people who suffer from their smoking.   My idea might sound strict with smokers. But as I know that thereÅfre some smokers who do want to smoke, I donÅft force them to stop smoking, because itÅfs their own responsibilities to decide whether they smoke or not considering their health. If they do want to smoke, they have to choose a proper place to smoke. For example, they can go to a bar where they are allowed to smoke freely without being complained.  In brief, we should completely ban smoking at all the restaurants in Japan and smokers should always care about other people. But some places where we are allowed to smoke should be left for smokers. I believethat this is the best way how smokers and non-smokers can live together.  
I disagree with the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  Today many people feel stressed.  They have to work from early in the morning to late at night and they have little time to feel relaxed.  Some of them may worry about human relations.  Smoking in their break time or after work is necessary for them to work vigorously.  Let me show you an example.  I work at an Italian restaurant.  In the evening about 40 percent of customers want to have smoking seats and they smoke while eating pastas.  As seeing them, I realize that nothing can make them happier than smoking after work.  And people who have non-smoking seats donÅft seem to mind cigarette smoke.  You may say that exposure to secondhand cigarette smoke could cause serious health problems, especially lung cancer.  In fact, there is a close connection between lung cancer and smoking.  So smoking seats must be separated from non-smoking seats in the restaurants.  And smoking people should keep in mind that people who do not smoke hate to be exposed to cigarette smoke.  But as long as they follow the rule, we donÅft have right to deprive them of their pastime.  So I am against a complete ban on smoking at all the restaurants in Japan.  
 I agree this opinion. I have a strong opinion for smoking. Generally speaking smoking causes many problems to our body and to our daily lives. People lose their healthy body for long years smoking habit. Sometime lose their lives. And what is worse, it lose health not only people who smoke by themselves but also who stay with smoking people. It is too dangerous for us.      And many smokers throw cigarettes at the street. There are lots of cigarettes on the street in the city. I hate smoking people. Especially I hate people who smoke during eating. It is the worst one.       I sometime go to eat restaurant with my family. At the restaurant we enjoy the atmosphere and conversation and off course the taste of each dishes. About over 10 years ago, there were few restaurants which banned smoking. Many people smoked at the restaurant in spite of eating. All members of my family did not like smoking. So suddenly the smoke was coming our table, we felt very bad. And after that we felt tastes of the dishes were not good.       Please imagine particles of the smoke attaching on the raw fish at sushi restaurant! The fresh fish changes bad one at the moment.      Recently people learn the harm of smoking and have consciousness of smoking. For our happiness smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan forever. 
I agree with this opinion.  Recently, places where people can smoke have been limited.  But, smoking is not banned at most restaurants.  Smoke bothers me when someone smokes near me at a restaurant.  Smoke smells too terrible for nonsmokers.  And smoke makes a meal worst, even if the meal taste very good.  I always think that smokers should put up with smoking while they are in a restaurant.  Perhaps most nonsmokers think so.  But, we Japanese people, especially in my case, cannot tell smokers to stop smoking though they feel unpleasant.  So, smoking must be absolutely banned at the all restaurants.  I wish I had my meal without worrying about smoke.  And smoke not only makes our meal worst, but also hurts our health.  It is secondhand smoke that we nonsmokers breathe in.  Secondhand smoke is more toxic than smoke which smokers directly breathe in.  And secondhand smoke is said to causes various diseases such as lung cancer.  I absolutely donÅft want to breathe in such a poison gas in any places as well as restaurants.  Smokers should care about nonsmokersÅf health.  And, some people may think that restaurants lost customers if smoking is banned at all the restaurants.  Certainly, some smokers may stop going to restaurants, but, perhaps, most smokers can stand smoking while they are in restaurants.   And, population of nonsmokers is by far larger than that of smokers.  So, more and more nonsmokers must go to restaurants and customers increase.  Therefore, thatÅfs no problem if smoking is banned at all the restaurants.  So smoking should be banned at restaurants.  
There are many arguments for and against about smoking.   I think it is good idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan, because smoking has no effective and good points.  I know a lot of smokers may smoke to distract them mind from them worries and get rid of them stress in them dairy life. Smokers feel good when they are smoking, but it is temporary pleasure. Smoking is incriminated as the major cause of lung cancer.  Heavy smoker will suffer terrible pain from smoking. Not only smokers, but also passive smokers will suffer any problems.  ItÅfs too bad. Then, I have a suggestion. To do exercise, hobbies are better way to escape from them stress. They should go out side and run or fun to sport, not go smoking room. We can escape our stress in another way.   It will be difficult to carry out this plan. But, smoker should be more sensitive to non-smoker at every space. To be in good health and not to feel uncomfortable in fun lunch time, I think we should ban smoking at all the restaurants in Japan and all over the world.   LetÅfs enjoy eating and talking in the restaurant!  
I think it is good idea to ban people from smoking in restaurant in Japan. Smoking damages smokerÅfs own health and his smoke damages people around him. Tobacco contains nicotine which causes many terrible actions for us.  Comparing with other advanced countries, the number of smokers of Japan is large. In Japan, the price of cigarette is relatively low and some people feel that smoking is cool. So the government of Japan should adopt a policy to decrease the number of that. Smoking gives worse influences for minorsÅf health than adultsÅf Beside sad to say, quite a few people in smokers started smoking when they are teenagers. And most smokers tend to smoke after eating. Even some of my friends say, ÅgIt is necessary for me to smoke after meals.Åh If we forbid smoking in all restaurants, occasions of no smoking will increase and it may going to lead to decrease the number. And because chances of minors seeing smoking people will also decrease, we will be able to reduce interests of them for smoking. If we really carry out this plan, surely some smoking people will object against it. But Japanese government should act for its own nation. This is why I agree with the opinion that we should prohibit from smoking in all of the restaurant in Japan. 
I donÅft agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I donÅft smoke and donÅft want to breathe the smoke that someone blows, but this idea is very excessive. We should take smokerÅfs feelings into consideration, and that idea completely ignores their feelings.   Certainly, I can understand the idea that no-smokers want to keep away smoke from them, because I sometimes think so. TobaccoÅes smoke has many problems. For example tobaccoÅfs smoke does a lot of damage to our health. The possibility that you may get cancer and a lot of other illness increases very much by breathing tobaccoÅfs smoke. In addition to this fact, smoke does the same damage to secondary smoker, so no-smoker but secondary smoker is as good as smoker. From a viewpoint of no-smoker, that they canÅft allow existence of smoke is convinced.    Smoker enjoys smoking and look forward to smoking, but when they go to a restaurant, if smoking is completely banned, they canÅft enjoy and relax. Considering both sidesÅf opinion, the idea that we make the smoking place that is completely isolated from no-smoking places and of course they can eat is best.   Restaurants should be the place that all people enjoy and relax, so smoker should care about no-smokerÅfs feelings and no-smoker mustnÅft exclude smoker from restaurant. 
  I think that we do not need smoking, but I disagree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at the restaurant in Japan.    First, if we ban to smoke at the restaurant, I think that people who like smoking will be poor. Though people who do not like smoking be poor too, I think that it is not a problem if restaurants make seats in the smoking section or a smoking room. For people who always smoke, if restaurants suddenly ban to smoke, they cannot deal with this opinion.    Second, I think that the proceeds of restaurants will decrease if restaurants ban smoking. This is because all of the smokers do not want to go to the restaurants. I think that the number of smokers is not few, so they should not ban to smoking. Of course, needless to say, they must protest the location which people who do not smoke have. It is OK if we think both people.     This is why, though we have to take people who do not like smoking into consideration, I think that we do not need to ban to smoke at the restaurants in Japan. We should protect the right of smoking there.  
  I think that should not always be banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  Instead of it, I want to divide the people the people for smoking or not smoking.  That is to say, the restaurants make some smoking places.   It is because that I hate smoke.  When I'm near smoking people, my lung is like seized and I feel so bad.  Furthermore not smoking people near smoking people will be also cancer like smoking people.  So not smoking people should not be near the others.  Now, there are many ones like so.  I feel it so good.  It is personal decision whether he smoke or not smoke.  So we shouldn't ban smoking, but smoking people cause harassment to the others.  We have many problems about smoking like walking with smoking, getting cigarette away on the street, our environment and so on.  Of course at restaurant, we think seriously about general way of smoking.   
It doesn't have to be banned I think.  These days many people smoke in restaurants during meal. And they enjoy the smoke to their hearts' content.  But Smoke of tobacco can be so uncomfortable for some of non-smoking people.  And when they're eating it must be more.  I don't know why some people like to smoke during meal. They don't smell good. They don't feel comfortable.  Have lunch with enjoying the annoying smoke?  It's stupid.  In the other hand I know some people love smoking so that they say they may "die" if they didn't smoke for so long time. Then what should restaurants do to solve the problem of tobacco?  There will be an answer of mine;  Restaurants all over the world, not only in Japan, should have another room divided by wall with door.  And the door may be small as much as it works.  Then both smoking people and non-smoking people may be fan during in the restaurant.  I know this can be too strict for the most of the people.  But I dislike the smoke of tobacco so much at least during the diet. 
I agree with this statement. Because, there is a variety of people in restaurant. For example, someone donÅft like cigarette smoke, someone may be a pregnant woman who have to avoid cigarette smoke, someone want to quit smoking, and so on. Some people like these surely feel uncomfortable, if they smell only a few cigarette smoke.    Recently, restaurant floor is divided into the two sections, smoking section and non smoking section. But, from my viewpoint where I donÅft like a cigarette smoke, I want to prohibit smoking in all sections. But it is strict.    And, smell of cigarette smoke becomes the interference which enjoy the smell of the dishes. I have heard before that cooks donÅft smoking in order to keep their palate normal. So palate is so sensitive. By smoking, our palate become abnormal, this is wasteful. I like eating delicious dishes, so this problem that smell of cigarette smoke becomes the interference which enjoy the smell of the dishes is very serious.      Anyway, smoking affects the health and feeling of those around the smoker. Of course affects the health of the smoker too. From these reason, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.   
IÅfm of the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants In Japan. I think so because I have ??? reasons. The first reason is that smoking does harm to not only smoking person but also the people around him. He is free, to be sure, to do something he wants to do. But, he doesnÅft have a right that he does harm to other people. Moreover, they have a right that they are healthy to live a long time. Furthermore, smoking does harm to them worse than him. I think that this action is very selfish.  The second reason is that smoking has a bad influence on smoking personÅfs health and the cigarettes are too expensive. Moreover, the cigaretteÅfs price keeps on increasing because the government will decide to add to cigaretteÅfs tax. The smoking persons pay a lot of money and are done harm to by the cigarettes. I donÅft think that is a very good idea.  The third reason is that the most people around the smoking person feel unpleasant. If many people feel unpleasant when they are walking, they feel so when they are eating. People shouldnÅft do something other people feel so as possible as they could.  Therefore JapaneseÅfs government should ban from smoking in restaurants.
I agree to the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. There are a lot of restaurants that have the seats for smokers and the seats for nonsmokers. But on the seats for nonsmokers, cigarette smoke come from seats for smokers. And the smell of tobacco smoke sticks to our clothes. We are displeased. And because of the smell of tobacco, my appetite often falls off. Restaurant is the place for people who want to eat something, not for people who want to smoke. The most reason that I agree to the opinion is that cigarette smoke is bad for our health. Cigarette smoke contains tar, CO and so on. They are bad for our health. Tar causes cancer. And because of CO, a blood vessel becomes thin. Of course, they hurt smokers. But they hurt nonsmokers, too. That is passive smoking. In other words, a nonsmoker absorbs cigarette smoke that a smoker released. Can the smoker bear the responsibility if nonsmoker gets cancer? I think they canÅft. So I think smokers who smoke next to a nonsmoker easily lack of a sense of responsibility. Because of these things, I agree to the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
   I agree that smoking should be completed banned at all the restaurants in Japan. ItÅfs because smoking donÅft feel good to some people including me.     I went to a restaurant with a friend who often smokes. When we had a dinner, he smoked and his smoke blew in my face, so I felt bad. Tastes of the dishes became bad. If all smokers were to be able to care about place and others, we donÅft need to make rules.     I canÅft understand that why young people become smokers although it is clear medically that smoking is very bad for healthy. Moreover passive smoking is also bad for us. In Norway and in some states of America, Australia and other countries, all the restaurants ban smoking. ItÅfs because passive smoking wreck employees there. So making legislation to ban smoking in the restaurants and hotel is important for non-smokers and also for smokers because it might make them keep from smoking. Young people who become smokers might decrease. Compared with the West, Japan falls behind for campaign against smoking. So I feel happy that the mood of no-smoking spreads in the society and that people around me are more temperate in their smoking.     Therefore, we need to have a legislation to ban smoking. 
 It is important for college students to have a part-time job. I agree with this statement. I intend to explain why I think so.      First, I think that college students shouldnÅft depend on their parents. Because they are not children and colleges cost their parents a lot of money. And many college students think that want to buy many kinds of things and experience various events. So they should earn money by themselves.      Second, it is important for them to know about society. They can experience many things through a part-time job. For example, how to use respect languages, how to communicate with customers and so on. They will be able to glow through these experiences.       Finally, they will be able to meet many important persons at their part-time jobs. For examples, friends, superiors and customers. These people will give them some advices for life. And people who meet at a part-time job may become friends at life for them. To have personal relationships is very important.      As I have said above, I think that college students should have a part-time job. Surely they will get various things through these jobs. And they will have a full campus life. 
 I think college students should have a part-time job if they have enough time. There are two reasons for thinking of it.  Firstly, it is necessary for college students to experience what it is like about working. And a part-time job is one of the most suitable ways to experience it. Now I work at juku, Japanese cram school, and teach two students some subjects at the same time. I havenÅft realized the difficulty in teaching someone before I started to work although I wanted to get an English teacherÅfs license. At first, I thought it hard to work there but now IÅfm really happy when my students understand what I teach them. WhatÅfs more, I came to have responsibility for working because IÅfm employed and I have to get students to improve grades.  Secondly, you can meet many people, especially people who are members of society. I also meet many kinds of people at my working place. In particular, senpai, who work there much longer than me, often help me and advice me what to do in some situation. Their attitudes toward working are always helpful for me.  To be sure, some people may say it is important for college students to study than to have a part-time job or they should experience job training instead of a part-time job. However, I think a part-time job is kind of study and a term of job training is very short.  ThatÅfs why I suggest that college students have a part-time job. 
I agree with the opinion that it is important for collage students to have a part time job. I have a few reasons for this in terms of economy and society. First of all, collage students need more money to live or spend for leisure than before, so a part time job is the best way of earning money easily and quickly for them. If collage students, such as who live on money which is sent from their parents, donÅft have a part time job, they cannot keep on living when sending money is stopped. Also, they can reduce their parentsÅf burden to send money once a month by having a part time job. Second, I think that having a part time is learning the importance of working and responsibility. Collage students must work with responsibility in society in near future. In this regard, working part time is very meaningful to them as a means of learning society. Finally having a part time job enables collage students to make relationships with many people who are different age or have different thoughts from theirs, and by this, collage students can know different values. For these reasons, I agree with the opinion that it is important for collage students to have a part time job. 
I donÅft think itÅfs important for college students to have a part time job. ThereÅfre two reasons why I think so.  First I think what college students must do is to study and having a part time job is a waste of time. All students must have studied hard when they were high school students to learn a lot of things at colleges. So if they have time to do a part time job, they should study hard instead. Furthermore I have a friend who has many part time jobs and failed. He worked at a restaurants and school for passing college entrance examinations as a teacher at the same time. Those two part time jobs were so hard for him that he wasnÅft able to study at all. As a result, he couldnÅft graduate from college. The conclusion is that having a part time job has a risk.  Second, in my opinion, college students should join some club activities. There they can develop friendships that they can keep forever. Some may say that college students can develop true friendships through part time job, but to cooperate and try toward one goal is peculiar to club activity. All college students have to do is not have a part time job but study and join club activities. That is why I donÅft think itÅfs important for college students to have a part time job.   
I think it is important for college students to have a part time job. I have three reasons for this.  First, students should learn social manners while they are still students.  It is too late to learn them after having work or joining in a company.  They might take impolite actions and make their boss angry.  In order to prevent that kind of situation, students should know basic manners such as using polite words, how to act to customers, and responsibility towards their work.  Second, students should know how hard and bone-breaking it is to earn money.  If they have no chance to learn about it, they would probably spend much money that their parents had earned, without knowing how precious and valuable money is.  Lastly, students should encounter with many people while they are young.  I think it is not good to stay in small groups, which members consist of only their college friends.  It might be helpful to have friends or people whom students can rely on, other than just their college friends.  What is more, learning co-workersÅf lifestyles may have good effects to them and inspire their way of living.  These are the reasons I agree with the idea, it is important for college students to have a part time job.
I think that college studentsÅf having a part-time job is important and necessary. I have some reasons for this.  First of all, having a part-time job brings us lots of precious experiences. For example, I work at Starbucks Coffee as a part-time barista. To work there, I really have to study how to prepare beverages, how to make customers happy and relax, how each coffee beans are different and each oneÅfs tastes, how we can make Starbucks Coffee attractive and so on. I decided to work there because I have once heard that working at Starbucks Coffee makes people grow up. I have to memorize many things but I really like to work there since I can study lot from a part-time job.  Secondly, we can earn money by having a part-time job. Commonly, college students spend more money for going out with friends and so on than high school students. I have to earn money a bit for my leisure time. Some of them live by themselves. In that case, they have to earn money as much as they can. The only means to making the livelihood is having a part-time job.  From above-mentioned points, I fairly agree with the issue. 
I agree that college students have a part-time job. I have two reasons for that.  First, they can earn much money. I think college students are required to pay much money than ever for something, for example, drinking with their friends, getting a car license, traveling this country or foreign countries, and so on. They should get money by myself, not by their parents.   Second, they can learn polite Japanese expression. Recently, it is said that many young people cannot use polite expression. It is not good for them when they work in the future. So, while they are students, they should experience to use polite expression.  I insisted good points to have a part-time job, but there is one point that they have to be careful. That is a balance between a part-time job and studying. I think most important thing for college student is studying. Therefore, I recommend having a part-time job unless it prevents them from studying.  
I agree with the opinion ÅgIt is important for college students to have a part time job.Åh because there are three things we can learn from having a part time job. The first thing is how to communicate well with any kind of people. We have to be kind to everyone who comes to our store whether we like him/her or not. Anyone who comes to our store is a customer. Sometimes there are some unkind customers, but we can try to coop with them and learn how to get well with them. The second thing we can also learn from it is how difficult it is to make money. I think most of us donÅft know what it is like to make money by ourselves until we start to do various part time jobs during college days. Then I think we will be able to give thanks to our parents.  The third thing is the width of society. We will notice that there are various kinds of jobs, and at the same time, unlimited possibilities lie on us. Part time job may give us a chance to think about our future. I think part time job connects people, like parents and their children, and donÅft forget that it also connects our future and us. Therefore, I agree with the opinion. 
I agree with this opinion because it teaches us how hard to get money. I hadnÅft had a part-time job before I became a college student. So, if I had something to want, parents gave me money as ÅgokodukaiÅh and I could go shopping. I didnÅft think seriously that how long my parents work hard to make the money when that time. However, since I began to work part-time, I got to know that making money is not easy. I donÅft have enough rest in working time, scolded by owner when I make a mistake and they make me very tired. Moreover, all of the money I earned is spent soon in my daily life. Then I feel I mustnÅft waste money.   Most of college students have to get job and live by themselves after a graduation. So I think it is need to know how hard it is while we are college students. Because I actually experienced working and I find it is harder than I imaged. Having a part-time job is one of a good way to know about working.  ThatÅfs why I agree with the opinion itÅfs important for college students to have a part time job. 
I agree with the idea. There are two reasons why I think so.  Firstly, I think college students should earn money and support their familyÅfs finance.  Generally speaking, college students need much money for tuition fee, text books, clothes, and so on. And many college students have enough time to have a part time job. So they can work if they want to. ItÅfs possible to rely on their parents for money, but I think college students are old enough to work and help their family. Even if the money they can get from a part time job is little, itÅfs important to try to make money by themselves.  Secondly, a part time job will be very precious experience for college students. In fact, IÅfve taken a part time job at restaurant and I learn many things from it. For example, I learned how to behave politely and the importance of smile thorough my job. To make customers feel relaxed, itÅfs important to behave politely. Not only politeness, but also smile is very important. I think that learning many things like this will improve me. ItÅfs good to know what it is like to ÅgworkÅh through a part time job before we graduate and start to work at company.  So for these reason, I think itÅfs important for college students to have a part time job.  
I agree with the statement ÅgIt is important for college students to have a part-time job.Åh There are three reasons to support my answer.  First, I donÅft have much money, so I cannot help getting some money by working. I recently move to Kobe and live there by myself now. My mother always sends some money every month. But I must earn some money because there are too many things I want to buy. This is the first reason why I have a part-time job.  Second, it can be useful to have a part-time job when I graduate from Kobe University and work for a company. I give an example. I worked at a convenience store during summer vacation last year. I worked hard, and I could learn consumerÅfs needs, business skills about the reception, hospitality, and so on through the job. That is why I understand the importance of a part-time job.  Third, as I work, I get to make out the pleasure of the job. For example, I taught a high school student as a part-time job in September last year. He was poor at mathematics, so I kept teaching mathematics. Fortunately, his grade became good. Then he said to me,Åh Thank you.Åh I was happy to hear the word, and knew the fun. That is why I support my answer.  Therefore, I agree with the statement ÅgIt is important for college students to have a part-time job.             
I agree with this idea. Because college student need money for something such as buying text book and clothes, going somewhere, meal, and so on.  Especially I think people belong to any club need some money. For example, I belong to light music circle and form a band. Of course we need to practice but we canÅft if we rent studio. We also need to buy instruments for instance guitars. So I need money and I have to have part-time-job. (I work at cram school and earn money now.) I also think part-time jobs are not only way of getting money but getting some good experience. I worked some kind of jobs for instance, move worker, making frozen pizzas,  distributing tissues etc until now. I could know troubles someone who does it from them.Å@So I agree with this idea in this point.Å@ But I also think having too many part-time jobs is bad for us. In our life of college, We have something which we can do then. But if we work everyday, we canÅft do them. So I agree with having part-time jobs but donÅft think we work too hard. This is my opinion. Thank you. 
I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. IÅem a part-time worker as a clerk in a cake shop. Before I have this part-time job, I thought it is not important for college students to have a part-time job because it is more important for us to study. But in the last winter, I became accustomed to a campus life and I started to work part-time for the first time in my life. And I learned too many things there. IÅfll pick out three things.  First, I learned how hard to earn money. I think there is no way to earn money easily. I gave presents for my parents by my first pay to say thank you. Secondly, I learned how important to have responsibility. OneÅfs tiny miss affects every membersÅf work and the cake shop as a whole. But my employer said Ågit is important to cope with the problem well, not to make mistakes.Åh I am encouraged by this hearty word. Finally, I learned how pleasing to have a part-time job. I can see the world that I donÅft notice as a customer and it is pleasing to give a reward for myself. And what is the most important thing for me is to get acquainted with many people through this job. I think having a part-time job is good for oneself and for all. It is the good chance for college students to learn many important things before becoming a member of society.  
I believe that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. It is because to have a part-time job makes your point of view clearer, wider and deeper. College students are most flexible. So college days are the best time for make world views changed.  My first point is that to have a part-time job makes your point of view clearer. It is because if you have a part-time job, you can know what to work really is. If you donÅft have a part-time job, you canÅft know this. By knowing this you will realize how hard to earn money is. Also you can understand the pleasure of work.  My second point is that to have a part-time job makes your point of view wider. It is because if you have a part-time job, you can meet much more people than if you donÅft have a part-time job. For example, if you donÅft have a job, you can meet only family, friends and teachers. But if you have a part time job, you can meet small kids or old people.  My final point is that to have a part-time job makes your point of view deeper. It is because if you have a part-time job, you may think much more things than if you donÅft have a part-time job. For example, if you fail at your job, you will think how you can succeed in your job next time.  So in conclusion it is important for college students to have a part-time job because it makes your point of view clearer, wider and deeper. College students should have a part-time job. 
 I think that itÅfs important for college student to have a part-time job for three reasons.      Firstly, we can meet many persons through jobs.  We spend the major part of a day attending lectures or talking with our friends at colleges.  However, once we graduate from own college, we need to associate more persons than now.  In order to get along with them, itÅfs necessary to have great extent of thinking because everyone has different way of thinking.  Meeting many persons is good for it.  For example, my cousin worked as a salesclerk, a teacher and so on.  She met many persons and learned their way of thinking.  Now, she works as a tour guide and makes most of what she learned. Secondly, we can experience many kinds of jobs before we choose own job.  I think that to choose own job is one of the most serious decisions through the life.  People who quit their job often say ÅgThis job doesnÅft fit me.Åh  If we experience many kinds of job, weÅfll know which job is agreeable to us.  The number of people who quit job will decrease and weÅfll be able to choose job with confidence.      And finally, we can be economically independent from our parents to some extent.  When we were high-school students, we were expected only to study so our parents paid our school expenses.  Now, we can study, work and earn money.  Sooner or later weÅfll have to pay our cost of living.  Before we stand on our own feet, we had better start to pay it as a preparation.      For these reasons I think itÅfs important for college student to have a part-time job. 
I think university students should have a part-time job. For one reason, a lot of students are live a single life, but there were few students who are given enough money to live by their parents.   University students have a lot of time than working members of society, and have freedom to think or act like they want to than high school students. But in fact, we canÅft live like this because we donÅft have enough money.  For example, IÅfm here in Kobe University, and I live alone. At first, my family thought that I could get a scholarship, but maybe I canÅft. (The result of the discussion is not announced yet.)   In addition, if we belong to some club activity, we need a lot of money for it. I belong to Ågk-on-ROCKÅh. In this club, we can play a variety of music. To play music in a band, I have to buy a guitar, effecter, a tuner, and so on. These are too expensive for us to buy without a part-time job. If we want to live a full life in campus, we need money!    Moreover, we can learn the hardship of making money by working, and we can feel a sense of fulfillment. In fact, I got my first salary in my life two days ago, and I feel so happy!!   These are the reasons why I think university students should have a part-time job. 
 In Japan, many college students have a point job. They work in restaurant, convenience store, and as teachers who teach elementary, junior high school or high school students, and so on. The purposes of having such jobs differ from students, but   I think it is important for college students to have such a point job.     The first advantage in having a point job is that they can use money for themselves. For example, when a student wants to study abroad, she needs much money. Maybe her parents support her, but she began to say it so she should earn some money by herself to use for it. And when college students play with friends, they use more money than when they were high school students. If you donÅft have a point job and canÅft afford for money, the relation between you and your friends will worse.      The second advantage is that they can learn social rules and get much kind of skills. For example, if you work in restaurant, you can learn how to contact with customers and your bosses. If you work as a teacher, you can learn how to tell what you want clearly. Perhaps you discover the work you want to enter.     Thus if you have a point job, you can earn money to use freely and learn your society. So I agree with college studentsÅf having point jobs. 
I agree with the opinion that it is important for college students to do a part time job. There are some reasons. First, money is essential for our life. Second, we can experience the importance and difficulty of earning money by ourselves. Third, at some workplace we can make new human relationship with people in the same workplace. All the reasons are very useful for college students when they graduate from the university and get a job. Some people may say it is not important for college students to do a part time job, because the most important thing for the college students is learning. Only thing college students have to do is studying hard. And to do a part time job so hard deprive college students of the time to study.  But I donÅft think that learning is only thing the college students have to do. For example the other things the college students have to do are doing a part time job, club activity and so on. It is not good only to do a part time job. But almost all college students do a part time job with studying hard. So I agree with the opinion that it is important for college students to do a part time job.                    
I think itÅfs important for college students to do a part time job. There are three reasons.  First, we need much money for going to university. We have to pay school expenses, and the rent or great travel expenses. I think that we shouldnÅft be unconcerned to our own household economy, and we should earn money even if it is a little.   Second, this is the most important reason, we can experience some jobs. When we become adults and start to work, we may be confused. We suddenly become responsible, are often scolded, and get nervous. Some of us may lose the way to work. This is because we can never know the difficulties of working till we work. But, if we have some experiences of working, those will surely help us to know how to behave for the occasions.  Third, we can meet various people through part time jobs. I think itÅfs very nice thing. I have made friends with a man who was over thirty. I was affected by him in lots of things. His story is always very interesting for me because we have lived quite different lives. I feel very happy to do part time jobs when I can see people like this man  These are the reasons why I recommend doing part time jobs to college students. I especially regard part time jobs as opportunities for practicing working and learning society. So, I think itÅfs very important and valuable for college students to do a part time job. 
 I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Because, if there are some people who is smoking at a restaurant, surrounding people can be uncomfortable by harmful and smelly smoke when they are enjoying a meal. Smoke affects not only human body but also feelings of people who do not smoke. And, most of restaurants in Japan have a nonsmoking section and a smoking section, but, people who is in a nonsmoking section can not necessarily avoid smoke. Nonsmoking people who go to a restaurant with smoking people also have to eat at smoking section even if they do not like smoke. And also, the purpose of people who go to restaurant is not smoking but eating tasty food, so, people should taste only food. Cooks will hope this too. Moreover, value of smoking is nearly nothing. Smoking harms human body, and people who smoke have an increased risk of developing lungs cancer, so, banning smoking at many places may prevent smoking people to smoke and help to prevent illness. So, if smoking is banned at all restaurants, not onlyÅ@nonsmoking people become happy, but also smoking people may be able to improve health condition. From these reasons, I think that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan. 
Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I canÅft agree with this statement. I intend to explain why I think so. First, I donÅft like cigarettes but I think that smokers have a right to smoke because smoking is permitted legally. If many smokers want to smoke while eating or after the meal, I think we donÅft have a right to ban it. Second, I think restaurants should promote to separate smoking and no smoking. There are many people who feel unpleasant to cigarettes, including me. Some of them donÅft eat at restaurants which donÅft provide not smoking seats. But if restaurants provide smoking seats and not smoking seats, they will eat there. If restaurants do it, they may make more benefit. And they cost little expense to provide their seats. Finally, if you think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan, I think smoking should be banned every places except smoking areas. Otherwise we canÅft explain to smokers why they must not smoke at only restaurants. Smoking is difficult problems for us. I think we shouldnÅft consider these problems with biased views. We must solve them for both smokers and not smokers. 
In my opinion, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. There are four reasons why I agree with the ban on smoking.  First, smoking isnÅft good for smokerÅfs health. By keeping smoking, their condition is getting bad. According to statistics, smoking is picked up as the major cause of lung cancer.  Second, smokers sometimes do non-smokers harm. By receiving the smoke generated from the smokers. Ordinary people become ill or have lung cancer in the worst case. This is called passive smoking. Passive smoking causes the trouble for non-smokers, especially pregnant women.  Third, once people begin smoking, it is very difficult to stop smoking. The tobaccos have a nature like drugs. If you always smoking and stop it for a while, you became nervous or feel frustration. And finally, you canÅft endure and will smoke. There are many people who want to stop smoking, but they have great difficulty to get over the smoking.  Finally, smoking can lead to the safe and waste problems. Throwing the tobaccos away sometimes happens at some places. If smokers donÅft extinguish their tobaccos, the fire may happen. And if they neglect them, the town may be dirty and increase some litter.  From their reasons, I support the idea of the ban on smoking.     
I agree smoking to be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I am a non-smoker. IÅfll pick up three reasons to tell why I agree this problem.  First, it is the problem of health. Do you know this expression ÅgSmoking is worse than uselessÅh? It means that smoking doesnÅft have profits, but has much risk. Tobacco-smoke is thought productive of cancer. In the restaurants, there are many people who donÅft like smoking. You should not smoke because passive smoking is worse than active smoking. Smoking is bad for you and for others, too  Secondly, it is the problem of eating with smoke. In the restaurant, even if you finish eating then you smoke, it may be the time the other people start eating. There are many people who lose appetite because of the smell of smoke. As far as I am concerned, I donÅft like to have a meal with smelling smoke because I think smoke makes taste of meals bad. Even though I sat on no smoking seat, the smell of smoke blows to me.  Finally, it is a moral problem. Restaurant is a public place where people enjoy meals. Even if you like to smoke, it troubles the other people in the restaurant. You donÅft forget smoke makes hair and cloths smell bad. If you go to the public place, you should have responsibility not to trouble others.  I agree smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan because of these three reasons. The restaurants arenÅft the place to smoke. If you would like to smoke, you must go to non-public places or smoking lounges not to trouble the other people. I think it is the most important to understand there are many people having different opinions. Your favorite things may make others unpleasant. 
I completely agree with the statement. I take it for granted that smoking is banned at all the restaurants. People who are nonsmokers have a right to avoid passive smoking and to enjoy dinner at the restaurants.   What is more, I think smoking should be banned at all the public places in addition to all the restaurants. Before entering the university I lived in Chiyoda-ku where smoking is banned on all the roads. Everyone keeps the rule and the city is clean.  Since I was accustomed to the surrounding, when I entered the university and began to live in Kobe I was so surprised to see a lot of smokers on the roads in this city and I felt so unpleasant. I think there must be a lot of people who feel unpleasant about it. Though smokers insist that they have a right to smoke, I think it is so absurd of them to smoke at the public places without caring about othersÅf feeling and health. So I think it is natural that people who smoke at the public places should be fined heavily. If smokers stop smoking at the public places in order not to be finned, the public places become more comfortable and cleaner.                This is why I agree with the statement. 
Nowadays, most of the public institutions such as station, office and even restaurant gradually don't allow smokers to smoke without reserve. This is because many citizens have begun to regard smoking as a harmful item to our health even by little and little, and not only the emitted smoke is smoky, but also the very smokers are actually stayed away by many nonsmokers.  According to statistics, the smokers tend to be victims of lung cancer with more high probability than the nonsmokers. It goes without saying that smoking brings bad health to the smokers. Especially the passive smoking: The nonsmokers are exposed to the unhealthy smoke and forced to `swallow' it, in fact its risk has been pointed out by a lot of professionals.  When we go into a restaurant, almost always we are asked by a floor staff "Would you smoke or not?" In many restaurants, they formally divide the seats into two groups; smoking seats and nonsmoking seats. However, there is not any screen and if even only one smoker began to smoke, almost all the guests in the floor irresistibly breathe the air contained the harmful smoke. So what meaning does it have at all? It spoil the delicious dishes and pleasant talks!  My father is a heavy-smoker and whenever he smoke at home, he always smoke outside of the house for the purpose of not annoying other members of my family. Similarly restaurants should take account for other guests but smokers and introduce such my family's rule, A smoker who couldn't put up with smoking after eating anyway should do go outdoors. 
Smoking , of course , is bad for health not only of smoker but also of surroundings . However , if a low that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants is provided , a rate of crime begin to rise rapidly . Nowadays , most of crime such as murder , theft , violence , and so on are due to stress . Thinking about security of life for citizens is more precious than any other thing . Therefore , the idea should be changed to an idea that smoking should be Åg partly Åh banned at all restaurants in Japan . Namely , it is important to establish restaurants for smokers and non-smokers separately . By doing so , all smokers can smoke without thinking about trouble for surroundings and refresh themselves . Non-smokers can also enjoy eating food without stress that comes from putting up with smoke and worry about their health . WhatÅfs more , not only reduce the rate of crime but improve national economy . For instance , if Japanese government provided the idea that I have just suggested , the sale of each restaurants would rise , and of cigarettes also would rise . As a result , taxes that come from these sales are increase and are sent to government to improve life of citizens . Thus , you will find that my idea is better than the theme . When you understand my idea , you will also disagree with the theme .     
Recently, the number of restaurants which prohibits smoking has been increasing. This   is because the idea that smoking is bad for not only smokerÅfs health but also the health   of non-smoker around smoker spread widely. But there are still many restaurants   which are not prohibits smoking completely. In many restaurants, manager separates   the seat for smoker and non-smoker. However, air connects to non-smokerÅfs seat from   smokerÅfs seat. So, even if the restaurantÅfs manager separates smoker and non-smoker,   smoking makes all people in the restaurants feel bad. Imagine if you are a non-smoke   and go to restaurant to eat dinner. In the restaurant, there are the seat for smoker and   the seat for non-smoker. Of course you sit in the seat for non-smoker, but the seat for   smoker is a little away from you in the same room. You can look tobaccoÅfs smoke and   smell bad. In this condition, you canÅft eat dinner pleasantly. Smoking makes the dish   taste bad. Smoking troubles customer like this. Also smoking troubles restaurantÅfs staff.   They have to snuff tobaccoÅfs smoke when they ask smoker the order or when they carry   dishes to smoker. Since they snuff tobaccoÅfs smoke many times everyday, the risk of   diseases related to tobacco is higher for restaurantÅfs staff than other people. Thus,   smoking in restaurant is trouble for other customer and its staff. If smoking is   completely banned at restaurant, customer can eat delicious dishes, restaurantÅfs staff   may live long, and also it is good for smoker. Thus smoking should be completely banned   at all the restaurants.     
I donÅft agree with the statement that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan. There are some reasons for this. First, restaurants are the place not only to have breakfast, lunch, or dinner, but also to take rest. In order to rest, some people eat and chat, other people smoke. Smoking is a kind of rest for smoking people. If smoking is completely banned at all restaurants, they will lose one of their places to rest. Second, I think we donÅft need to ban smoking completely. Nowadays almost all seats in restaurants are divided into Ågsmoking seatÅh and Ågnon-smoking seatÅh. I propose to increase the number of Ågnon-smoking seat,Åh in order for non-smoking people to be comfortable, or to isolate Ågsmoking seatÅh from Ågnon-smoking seatÅh by making walls made by glass. For these reasons, I donÅft agree to ban smoking at restaurants completely, in spite that I donÅft smoke. Smoking decreases our health, I know, but from the side of smoking people, smoking is a part of his life, so it is almost impossible to inhibit smoking people to smoke. Of course we need to separate Ågsmoking seatÅh and Ågnon-smoking seatÅh strictly
I am opposite to no smoking in all seats of the restaurant.  Because the biggest reason is an individual freedom.   As for the cigarette, only the point that harms the body tends to be closed up. However, the cigarette was a tool that helped communications before. Cigarette made people feel relax at the time of having a meal together. Moreover, it is crazy to restrict only the cigarette, and not to restrict liquor etc. they are harmful to the body in no small way.   The restaurant camouflages the best-before date recently.  The invisible harm is much more dangerous than the harm of the cigarette. It is necessary to review it from the system of the restaurant before it complains about the harm of the cigarette.   Basically, there are a lot of restaurants and pubs in which people can smoke. People who hate cigarette have to search for the restaurant and the pub of no smoking, to search for the restaurant and the pub where the smoking seat and the no-smoking zone are perfectly divided, or not to go to the restaurant and the pub. The cigarette is luxury goods. Do not criticize to person's hobby!    Mark Twain said, ÅgQuitting smoking is easy, I have done it thousands of times. Åh 
I agree with this statement. There are two reasons I think so.   The first reason is that cigarette smoke is very bad for our health. It is very poisonous not only for smokers but also for nonsmokers around them. It is said that the smoke causes cancer and other disease. Actually, I have had a sore throat because of smoke in a restaurant before. I am a nonsmoker, so I think that it is absurd for nonsmokers to become ill because of smokers. Of course, to ban smoking is good for smokerÅfs health.   The second reason is that the smoke is very uncomfortable for nonsmokers. I think that people go to restaurants to eat and get contentment. But if the restaurant is filled with cigarette smoke, we canÅft content. And we are puzzled when the smells of cigarette attaches to our clothes.   Now we can see the restaurants that separate seat for smoking and nonsmoking to solve these complain of nonsmokers. But this system also has a few problems. The case is that smokers and nonsmokers go to the restaurant together. If they sit smoking seat, nonsmokers feel uncomfortable because of smoke. On the other hand, if they sit nonsmoking seat, smokers canÅft content. It is difficult to satisfy both people.   I think society should regulation smoking. In fact nonsmoking is the mainstream in the Western countries. The number of smokers is decrease and they achieve comfortable life. If all the restaurants in Japan ban smoking, we will be able to get healthy and comfortable life. 
There are a lot of smokers in Japan. Businessmen smoke on almost every road and vending machines of tobacco are all around. Most of trash on street is used tobacco. Manners and health of smokers are more and more discussed these days. That results in restriction of smoking at many places. Though some people insist smoking should be banned at restaurants as well, should we ban smoking completely at all the restaurants in Japan?  A restaurant is a place where we have a meal. The cook makes dishes proudly and serves them to guests. When they smoke, they cannot taste the dishes. It means they spoil the dishes. This is why smoking at the restaurant is no recommendation.  Moreover, other guests are also in the restaurant. They enjoy eating, chatting with their friends or with their family. If their neighbor guest begins smoking, they stop eating or talking and have a glance at him. Joyful time suddenly turns into painful time. They are robbed of the right to enjoy the time at the restaurant. They have no way to avoid it.  For all these reasons, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. Smoking at the restaurant offends feelings and rights of other people.
These days, smoking has been prohibited at a bunch of public places, such as schools, stations and even some major streets in Kyoto.  That kind of trends is getting more and more popular among Japanese people, especially among those who donÅft smoke.  They will think restaurants, of course, are not exceptions, which I do not agree.  The main purpose of the restriction is to keep non-smokers from bad-smelling and harmful smoke of the cigarettes.  Therefore, as long as smokers and non-smokers are completely separated, it doesnÅft necessary to ban smoking completely.  Non-smokers might insist that they have rights to avoid disgusting smoke, but smokers also have the rights to smoke: smoking itself is not a violation of the law at all.  Some of them might smoke in order to feel relaxed and refreshed, and others might do to forget bad things.  In addition, cigarettes contain the chemical material called nicotine, which have a little addiction.  Some of the smokers have a serious difficulty in giving up smoking for this reason.    All things considered, we should not make smokers give up smoking at all the restaurants in Japan.  Prohibition of the law is too harsh on them.  We have much better choice; to make smoking areas in all of the restaurants.  By the designated areas, smokers and non-smokers can be completely separated.  This must be the solution whish both of them can be satisfied.  
    In my opinion, this is not a necessary movement.     I know there are a lot of people that dislike being around smokers and having to breathe that annoying, smelly piece of air with them. Especially parents are keen to avoid this, so that it might not harm their children. In fact, IÅfm one of these people. I hate the smell of the smoke coming from those cigarettes and I donÅft get why smokers smoke; all it does is happily welcome cancer. So I understand why some people say smoking should be completely banned at most places, including restaurants. What they say about smoking being harmful is true and they have a point. But is completely banning it truly necessary? If restaurants let people smoke all over the place, sure, thatÅfs definitely a problem. But most restaurants separate smoking tables from non-smoking ones, at some places the smoking area is even separated by plastic board walls and I donÅft mind the smoke at all; because it doesnÅft come! As I said earlier, I donÅft like the smoke that comes from smokers but I have friends who smoke (20 and over of course) and they say they do it to relax or settle down, and I donÅft mind them because they smoke in places out of harms way.      So in this way I donÅft think that banning smoking at all the restaurants in Japan is that necessary, as long as smokers are separated from the non-smoking in a decent distance, keeping their smoke to themselves.
Nowadays, the world is becoming harder to live in for smokers. If smoking in restaurants is thoroughly restrained by law, it means the denial of diversity of restaurants or individual lifestyles. Law should exert in the way that people can enjoy their freedom to the maximum extent, but the ban works in the other way around. Restaurants have the right to provide the regulation by themselves. Therefore even the restaurants only for smokers should be permitted. This can be one of the business strategies in this non-smoker oriented society. And people who want to smoke have the right to do so. While, it is true that non-smokers have to be protected from secondhand smoking. The obstacle to realizing all of these is in the restaurants which have two sections: for smokers and for non-smokers. Almost no people smoke in the non-smoking section. But if the non-smoking section is not completely separated from the smoking one, people who hate cigarettes end up exposing to smoke from the other compartment. So what really should be prohibited is incompletely separated smoking and non-smoking sections. This counterpart allows people to avoid or enjoy smoking and restaurants to make their rule on their own. The diversity and freedom of choice would be highly respected. When there is a moderate counterpart, a strict ban should not be adopted.    
I disagree with the opinion that smoking should be  completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Å@It is true that smoking is bad for others around as  well as for smokers themselves, but those who want to  smoke have a right to do so. We should not care about  only non-smokers and should accept smokersÅf rights.  At restaurants some places where you can smoke have to  be prepared. As long as smoking is not legally prohibited,  it seems unreasonable to try to exclude smokers. Å@I have suggested that we should admit smokersÅf rights,  and of course, we must also pay attention to non-smokersÅf ones.  In order to respect them, restaurants have only to completely  separate the seats for smokers and for non-smokers. It appears  much better that they separate even the rooms for both if you  take into account that smoke may go around. What is important  is that restaurants need to make both smokers and non-smokers  have a good time there because they are customers. Å@Thus I think that smoking should be partially admitted at  all the restaurants in Japan and that restaurants should  prepare the places such as the seats and even the rooms  for smokers and non-smokers.
I agree with this idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I have three reasons to support this idea; passive smoking, smell of smoke, and inefficiency of separating.   The chemicals which were included in smoke of cigarettes will do harm to people. The harm for passive smokers is sometimes worse than that for active smokers.  Therefore, being passive smokers is very dangerous for people in restaurants particularly for children and pregnant women. In restaurants, thereÅfre many kinds of people, such as men, women, baby, children, elderly, pregnant womenÅcand so on. For that reason, I think itÅfs not wise decision to allow smoking in restaurants.   For second reason, I think that the smell of smoke will spoil the delightful time of meal. When we eat something, we enjoy not only its taste but also its smell. In fact, the smell of food affects the taste very much. When I went to Kyoto, I entered a Japanese cafe, and I was enjoying gentle delicious smell of green tea which I ordered. At the moment, strong smell of smoking attacked my nose; it spoiled my pleasure at once.  Some people say that if we separate people by making smoking section and non-smoking section, there will be no problem. However, I think that it is not inefficient way for restaurants. If thereÅfre too many people who prefer non-smoking section, they have to wait for the seats even though thereÅfre empty seats in smoking section. In addition, the owners of restaurants have to make a wall between two sections to prevent from smoke flowing into non-smoking section. I think it cost much.  From these reasons, I think that all smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan. 
 Eating is one of the most important things in our lives. By eating, we can get energy and we can also have a good time with our family and friends. Eating is very enjoyable.   But when someone around me begins to smoke, smoking smell prevents me from enjoying eating any more. That often happens in a restaurant. Although some restaurants separate smoking area, itÅfs still not enough effective.   So I think we should ban smoking in a restaurant. This has two merits. First, we can keep a good health. Smoking is bad for our health and some people canÅft stand smoking smell. If one person smokes in a restaurant, the smoke will reduce their good health of all the people there because of second-handed smoking. Second-handed smoking is worse for health than first-handed smoking. In short, smoking gives bad effects on people around you. Second, we can enjoy eating more. A restaurant is where we enjoy eating and communication with others. Without smoking people, we could enjoy taste and flavor of foods ,and more conversation with our companies.Å@  Å@However, this plan may make smoking people angry and they may lose their joy of smoking. But if we take this plan, smoking people will not have to mind other peopleÅfs feelings and smoking people have a chance to give up smoking. Smoking causes addiction so smoking people relatively canÅft stop smoking by themselves. I think they can find another present time with their family or friends because giving up smoking spares them time and money.   Moreover, smoking in a restaurant is nothing but troublesome thing for non-smoking people. In my opinion, everyone will be happy if smoking is banned in a restaurant. 
I think we shouldnÅft make it a rule to prohibit smoking in a restaurant. Everyone has right to do what he or she wants as far as they donÅft harm other people.  Many says the smoke from the cigarette harm other people. I think so too, but is that only the smoke? We use a car and it makes terrible noise or exhaust gas. Those harm other people too, however we donÅft have the idea that we should prohibit driving a car.  What is the difference between these cases? I think we canÅft take them right to do what they want easily whatever they do.  In deed I really hate smoking. The smoke makes my clothes smell and it feels me sick.  For people like me, I think there should be some rules to avoid the smoke. Nowadays many restaurants separate the area the one is for non-smoker and the other is for smoker. This is very good idea.  I think there are many opinions to this problem and there are many ideas to solve this problem. However only I can say is that we shouldnÅft make rules easily.  So I disagree that smoking should be burned at all restaurants in Japan.
