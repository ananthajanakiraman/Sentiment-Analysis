 I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Although I had smoked the cigarette before, I have not done so in any longer now. There are many things that I have noticed after giving up smoking. 
     Firstly, the smoke hurts health of the people whom there is around a smoking person. For example, the smoke promotes getting to cancer. And the damage of the smoke is bigger than the one to a person smoking. I think the smoke is bad even if the restaurant is divided into a smoking room and the nonsmoking room because all the restaurants are full with the smoke.
     Secondly, for the people who do not smoke, smoke of cigarettes is not a good thing of a feeling. It is to say nothing of the smokes it to damage health, and it is not a good smell. The smoke makes those who are around the person smoking feeling bad.
     Thirdly, the smoke of the cigarette makes the room dirty. The smoke changes the color of the wall of the restaurant. Because the cleanness is lost, the impression of the restaurant gets worse. So it is not good for the restaurant.
     This is why I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
