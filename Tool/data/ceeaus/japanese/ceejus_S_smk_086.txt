These days I read a newspaper that says the numbers of people who smoke
are decreasing. One reason for this is that the price of cigarette is
rising. Second reason is more and more people understood the danger of
smoking. We can say today you are hard to smoke.
I think that you should not smoke in public place.
There are three reasons for this.
First, smoking makes you unhealthy. After all, smoker gets cancer more
easily than non smoker. It is not too much to say that cigarette may
kill you.
Second, smoking makes not only you but also other people bad health.
This is what we call passive smoking. There are a lot of people in
restaurant. If you smoke in restaurant, other people feel uncomfortable.
If other man often smokes near me in restaurant, I feel angry and
unpleasant. So, I agree with the idea that all restaurants forbid to smoke.
Third, cigarette smoke pollutes the environment. Cigarette smoke
includes plenty of bad things. They must pollute the environment.
Some countries already begin to forbid to smoking in restaurant. I think
we should learn the attitude. Cigarettes have no profit.
We should recognize it and build peaceful life.
