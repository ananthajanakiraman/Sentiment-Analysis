"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time
job. I have some reasons why I agree.
One reason is that we can earn some money. Two months have past since we
entered a college, and I think we need more money than ever. For
example, I have more opportunities to have dinner with friends and to go
shopping. And if we earn some money, we can notice how important money
is. So we need to earn money for ourselves.
Second reason is that we can make many friends. If we have part-time
job, we can meet different people from those who we can meet at a
college. There may be a person who is older or younger than you. And so,
by talking with them, we can share our thoughts and make more friends.
Last reason is that we can learn manners. When we talk with customers,
we have to speak politely. Before we become a member of society, we
should learn manners. So while we are college students, we should have a
part-time job.
Of course, we should study hard because we are college students. But I
think if we have time to do something, we should have a part-time job."
