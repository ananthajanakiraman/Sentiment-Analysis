I believe that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. It is because to have a part-time job makes your point of view clearer, wider and deeper. College students are most flexible. So college days are the best time for make world views changed.
	My first point is that to have a part-time job makes your point of view clearer. It is because if you have a part-time job, you can know what to work really is. If you donÅft have a part-time job, you canÅft know this. By knowing this you will realize how hard to earn money is. Also you can understand the pleasure of work.
	My second point is that to have a part-time job makes your point of view wider. It is because if you have a part-time job, you can meet much more people than if you donÅft have a part-time job. For example, if you donÅft have a job, you can meet only family, friends and teachers. But if you have a part time job, you can meet small kids or old people.
	My final point is that to have a part-time job makes your point of view deeper. It is because if you have a part-time job, you may think much more things than if you donÅft have a part-time job. For example, if you fail at your job, you will think how you can succeed in your job next time.
	So in conclusion it is important for college students to have a part-time job because it makes your point of view clearer, wider and deeper. College students should have a part-time job.
