I agree with the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all
the restaurants in Japan because there are a lot of nonsmoking people
who hate the smoke. I think it is important for Japanese people not to
smoke too much. In Europe, people are accepting the trend of nonsmoking
in public facilities. Japanese people should be more active to reduce
the number of victims of lung cancer that is caused smoking too. In
order to make the smoker give up smoking, the government should put more
tax on tobacco, and the company which produces tobacco should withdraw
from the business of tobacco. If the government put more tax on tobacco,
the income will increase and the financial condition of the Japanese
government will improve. As for the production of tobacco, in fact, JT,
which is the only tobacco producing company in Japan has started
withdrawing from the tobacco business. I think that the worldwide
tobacco boom has ended. So, the day will soon come when smokers are
avoided not only in the restaurant but also in everywhere. If they ban
smoking at a restaurant, the number of customers may decrease. But if
they ban smoking at all the restaurants, the smokers may give up smoking
at restaurant and go to restaurant without smoking.
