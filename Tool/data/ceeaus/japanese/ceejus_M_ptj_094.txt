I think college students should have a part-time job. Of course, IÅfm sure that college studentsÅf work is studying, but there is some reason.
The first reason is that they have known about the society yet. They must work as a member of society one day. Before they get a job, they should learn social skills, and be taught how hard living in society is. Students which were always studying in their high school days should do so, including me. I also donÅft have social skills at all. Especially I have difficulty in talking with other people, so I want to become good at it. I think that the ability to talk with other people is required anywhere in society. 
 Second, they should learn how difficult earning money is. Till now, they have been always using money, and able to get money from their parents. One day they will have to get money in their own. To prepare for it, college students should have a part-time job as soon as possible. I have been having a part-time job since I had entered the university. Before I entered the university, I thought that money appears naturally whenever I wanted it. But I was making a big mistake. I realized that earning money is very hard and I must not waste too much. 
 Anyway I really agree to the opinion that college students should have a part time job.
