"I agree with the opinion. For one reason, college students should experience earning money for themselves during their campus life. It is very important for them to realize how hard to get money because students these days are too dependent on their parents without any appreciation. They should appreciate that they can go to college. Actually, I started to live alone near my college and to do a part-time job. It is very hard work and I realized how hard it was to work for a living. I think every students had better realize it and it will be very good experience when they get jobs after their graduation. 

For another reason, they can broaden their views. If students donÅft belong to any club activities, their community must be very narrow. People they will encounter should be limited. Thorough part-time jobs, they can come across various people and exchange many opinions. Such encounters are very important for their future. Almost all of college students these days have no ideas what they want to be in the future. Therefore, it is also very good experience to seek their dreams.

Campus life is only 4 years, but we are allowed to be free no less than 4 years!!Time is very precious, so we must not spoil our time. Part-time jobs are one of experiences that you can do only while you are young. Thus, I agree that opinion.
