I think it important for college students to have a part-time job. There
are four reasons. First, to have a part-time job is helpful to know the
society. Most of the college students donÅft work. So they donÅft know the
way to live in the real world, for example how to earn money, how to act
manner, and how to communicate with the unknown people. These skills are
very important. Second, to have a part-time job is helpful to know how
hard to earn money. Probably, they lead the comfortable life because
they get the money from their parents. Generally, such life doesnÅft
teach them how important money is. But they have a part-time job, they
got money from themselves. So they can understand how hard to earn
money. Third, they can predict the roughly future. For example, a
college student has apart-time job in one company. So he would know the
mechanism to run the company and to earn profits. Moreover, he could see
old men whose he in the future may be alike. So he can predict the
future and know the futureÅfs trouble concretely. The final, they can get
great confidence. It is true that to have a part-time job, because their
main aim is to study in college. But they achieve it, so they can get
confidence that is helpful for leading life. By these reasons, I think
it important for college students to have a part-time job.
