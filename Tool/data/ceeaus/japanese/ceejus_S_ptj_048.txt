I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
Because the experience of a part-time job is helpful for oneÅfs life.
  Most of college students have never worked at office. Some havenÅft had
a part-time job. And after graduation from college, a major of college
students gets a job. If they have never worked as a part-timer, you will
be confused when you begin to work at your office or factory. It is like
that a person who cannot swim is thrown into a pool. If he comes to be
able to swim, it is all right. But if he cannot, he may die at the
worst. So college students need to work as a part-timer to train for the
time they have their job.
  But a part of college students never get a job. Some remain to college
for study. Others donÅft work because they can live without doing so.
Whereas they also need to have a part-time job when they are college
students. When we come to work, we can learn the feel of working people
and feel grateful for them. We can become a considerate person by the
working experience. And college students have the time comparably. That
is why I think a part-time job is important for college students.
