I agree with smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in Japan. 

Because the cigarette negatively affects our body. The cigarette doesn't negatively affect a person alone who smokes the cigarette. The person in surroundings that breathe in the cigarette smoke is negatively affected, too. Next, I will describe what adverse effect the cigarette gives the body. The most famous is lung cancer. The person who smokes the cigarette with the cigarette smoke becomes easy to become cancer it. Next, I think about woman's case. It is very dangerous that the woman pregnant with a baby in her belly smokes the cigarette. The cigarette smoke is not good for the baby at all. The minor's smoking is not similarly good either. The cigarette smoke has a very bad influence for the human growth. There is no goodness in smoking at young time at all. Therefore, I think that the place where the cigarette can be smoked only has to decrease fast. I think that the smoker situation will decrease in such a place's decreasing, too. 

I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in Japan because I consider the above. And I am not going to smoke forever.
