"I agree with this idea.
I think that college students donÅftÅ@have much
money they can use as they like.
They must earn money for life unless their parents feed them.
So,for some students,there may not be a room to choose if they should
have a part-time job or not.
Anyway,it will be a good experience to have a job outside their college.
They can learn many things,and parhaps have a different view toward society.
they can also feel confidence to finish the work and get money by
theirselves.
I think we should experience many jobs and meet many people there.
Though I have written these things,I have never had any part-time jobs.
The reoson is that I'm busy now preparing the festival called `Nada
Challenge"" held at newt month.
But after that festival,I'm going to have some part-time job.
I'm looking foward to finding good jobs and people.
I feel it is important to spend a limited time wisely, especially for
college students.

We should remember one thing;studying is the most important thing.
We must not spend too much time working.
If we do so,we will lose our grade.
On condition that we can manage our time and life,I think it's good and
important for college students to have a part-time job.That'all.
Thanks for reading my poor English.
