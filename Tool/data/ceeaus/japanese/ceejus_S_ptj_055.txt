It is important for college students to have a part-time job.

 I disagree with this statement. Because I think it is more important
for college students to study. Certainly, we have a lot of time we can
spend freely when we are university students. So, it is natural for us
to have a part-time job. We can get some money and buy something we
want, for example, CDs, clothes, books, etc. There are a lot of things
we want. And we can play our friends, go to movie and eat out. We can
enjoy our campus life if we have a part-time job.
 But we must not forget why we go to university. It is not easy for us
to understand what we study in university. I feel that even our
elementary classes, for example, physics or mathematics, are so
difficult. Maybe I am not smart. But if we receive advanced classes, we
must study much harder than now. So we need more time to study, read
many books, think of them. Of course, we can pass through many
examinations if we don't understand so much. We study so hard only a few
days or a few weeks before them. And we can spend the rest of our time
on a part-time job. But we should no do that. We should study as hard as
possible everyday.
