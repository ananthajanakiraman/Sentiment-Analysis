 I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. 
You may say that college students shouldnÅft have a part-time job but 
study. But I think that colleges are not the place which students only 
study 
 I have a part-time job. I am a home teacher. The job is difficult to do. I 
think that to teach is much more difficult than to learn. But it is a lot 
of fun. I am very happy when I let my students solve problems which they 
havenÅft been able to solve. Then, I feel that I got to be able to watch 
things by more views. This means that I got wiser at that moment. This is 
fantastic thing because to be wise is one of the real purposes of college 
students. Indeed, the part-time job which I have ever had is only home 
teacher, but other jobs also have the real purposes of college students. So 
I think it is important for us to have a part-time job.
 Our part-time jobs also help our parents by money. To study at college 
need much money. So our parents can face hardships because of money. But if 
we have a part-time job, they can avoid the hardships. Thinking from above 
reasons, to have a part-time job is good for us.
