If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan, the restaurants may not give enough service to customers. So I am against it. 
 It is true that smoking is harmful not only to the health of smoker but also to the health anyone around smoker. So if someone wants to smoke, he or she should smoke in the area separated from non-smokers. Actually there are many restaurants do the separation of space or times for non-smokers. Almost smokers are satisfied with that. But if smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants, many smokers canÅft be satisfied. Smokers canÅft enjoy a coffee and a meal without smoking. They may not think they quit habit of smoking to go to restaurants.
 Sempai of my universityÅfs club, she is studying abroad in Canada, said in NYÅfs restaurants smoker are complained. In New York smoking is already banned at all restaurants. So when someone at restaurant wants to smoke, he or she has to go out to smoke. This disturbs talking. So She said banning smoking at restaurants is not good. I also think so. 
 I disagree with complete banning, but I think there needs compromise between smoker and non-smoker. So I agree that smoking is completely banned at the restaurants where donÅft give separation of space or times for non-smokers.
