Recently, many regulations about smoking are enforced. For instance, in
some area if people walk with smoking, they are fined. This rule is
wonderful for non-smokers! IÅfm 18 years old so I cannot smoke. But I
donÅft want to smoke. Smoking hurt feelings. When you eat lunch with
your friends, next customer is smoking. Then what do you think? Perhaps
you think nasty, you do nothing but complain about the smoker with them.
Eventually you spoil lunch time. WhatÅfs more, smoking destroys our
body. By smoking, our stomach is dirty. And compared with non-smokers,
smokers are apt to get cancer. The death rate of smokers is also very
high than non-smokers. That is to say, smokers want to die quickly.
Smokers say that smoking is our pleasure. But I cannot understand their
words. When I was 8 years old, I smoked once. It was too hard for me to
smoke to end. What on earth is pleasure? Probably, there is no advantage
to smoke. I hope that one day tobacco will be clear completely. It is
the best means for the world. We want to get very clear air.
