"I think that it is important for college students to have part-time job because part-time job may give them precious experiences. 

First of all, they could know work is very hard and important. They could notice that their parents do works everyday for their family. And they may thank their parents. We canÅft live without works.

Second, they are taught importance of money by getting salary by their self. Most of them may often save money when they go shopping because they donÅft want to lose the money they get hard. They may plan how to use it, for example traveling, shopping and their hobby.

Third, their experiences will be useful when they get a job after graduate from their college. They could practice works in real atmosphere and know a lot of systems in working situation.

Also they are given many chances to find work they want to do by doing many kind of part-time job. 

However they have to study in college life. They passed entrance exam to study many subjects at college. But it is important for college students to have part-time job, they should have part-time job not to disturb their study. As a result of these things they could also use time well.
