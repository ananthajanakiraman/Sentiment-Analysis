It is said that tobacco is a poison, harmful for our healthy, and it is caused of cancer and other severe disease. Many people die from smoking around the world each year. And recently, it is often said that secondhand smoke is more dangerous, especially for children. In the small room like restaurant, there is a lot of danger of secondhand smoke. Some restaurants in Japan, there are divided two types of seats, smoking seat and no smoking seat. But sometimes the two seats are closed. So if someone smokes in the restaurant, there is also a danger of secondhand smoke even if we seat no smoking seat.  Therefore, to remove the danger of it, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. And it may enable to decreases the number of smoker. Many countries, especially America and Europe, make many laws and regulations to restrain from smoking. And there are often banned from smoking at all the restaurants. But some Japanese people donÅft consider the danger seriously. They think that smoking is not so harmful for us. For that reason, Japanese laws and regulations about smoking are less and easier than that of other developed countries. But it should be more strictly in Japan. Smoking is harmful, not any good.
