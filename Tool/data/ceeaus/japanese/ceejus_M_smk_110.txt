I think that smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.The thing that all the restaurant completely ban smoking is unbelievable.Some restaurants should allow people to smoke.There are many people who smoke in Japan.If all the restaurants completely ban smoking there,many people who smoke become depressed and have a lot of stress.Therefore,the restaurants which ban smoking have less guests than one which allow people to smoke there.So,I think that each restaurant should decide whether they ban smoking there or not.Now,I hate tabaco,but I may smoke in the future.Then,if I can't eat lunch or dinner smoking,I may tears.And I may commit suicide.Now that a lot of people suicide in Japan.I think that the increace of no smoking area is one cause of the increace of suicide.So,I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant.
