  I agree this opinion that part-time job is important for college school students, because I studied a lot of thing with my part-time job.   At first, the communication skill is necessary to work. We must talk to owner and companion, although it is not so necessary to talk to others at college school. We must talk to our guests too. We can get good communication skill with working. we can many variety friends too. At working place, there are many peoples. Their age or environment who grow up is different from yourselves. When you get along with them, you know new inspiration and it will be useful thing.  Second, the experience get money from working is important for our life of college school student. We will have to make a effort to get a good job. For these difficult activities, part-time jobs are practice. We must appeal ourselves to owners both of them to get work. If we get part-time job, this success is turned into our confidence.  Third, many University student want more money. Someone need money because play with their friends. Someone need for traveling. Someone need for hobbies. Someone need for eating enough. Part-time job is best for us to make money.
