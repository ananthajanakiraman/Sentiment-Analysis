"I think it is very important for college students to have a part-time
job. It is because the experience to work and to get money with
themselves may make the college students growing up. Angering their boss
and missing their job may give them rich spirit. After they become the
member of society, they will enjoy and leave wonderful achievement.
If they donÅft have a part-time job when they are the college students,
some of them will be worthless people. They donÅft know the society. They
donÅft know that itÅfs importance to get money with working. Of course,
some of the college students who donÅft work know that important view.
But, many of the college students may not know. I think.
Other reason of the importance of a part-time job is simply. College
students need much money. Whether they stay home with their family or
not, they may want to enjoy the college life. It may be the play, study
and love. Anyway, they need much money. So they must have a part-time job.
Finally, I think, it is not only the college students but also society
to want the college student to have a part-time job. The college
students are the element of society, too. If none of them worked,
society might not exist.
