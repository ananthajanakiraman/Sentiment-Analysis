I think that college students have to do a part-time job. Because they need much money than high school students.
 First reason is that they donÅft have school uniforms. So, they have to buy a lot of clothes. Needless to say, they doesnÅft only buy clothes but also variety things like shoes and bags.   
 Second reason is that many of them started to live alone, when they became college students. So, they canÅft usually get enough money from their parents.
 Third reason is that text books of college are expensive. 
Forth reason is that they get a lot of free time than high school students.
  
Now I have a part-time job. I started it when I became college students. And I learned a few rules of society, thanks to do part-time job. And I knew how difficult to get money for working myself, and I noticed the importance of money.
 
 To conclude, I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
  
But, they have to study enough to step up the next year. I knew the person who could not step up his next year because of the surplus part-time job.
