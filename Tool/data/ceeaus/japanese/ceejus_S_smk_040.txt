I think itÅfs a bad way. There are two reasons why I disagree with this
opinion.

First, smoking is a right culture. There are many many people who love
smoking and cannot do without smoking. A famous philosopher is said that
he must have not been able to make his great theory without smoking.
Like this, smoking is a part of their life. I havenÅft ever taken smoke,
but I wonder the feeling of a heavy smoker having meal without smoking
is as sad as the feeling of us eating Soba without chopsticks. Like the
people who canÅft enjoy eating with smoke, there are the people who canÅft
enjoy eating without smoke. This is a just difference of cultures. So we
canÅft judge which one is right. And restaurants are not places only to
have meal but also to have fun. So this opinion is completely ignore
smokers, a large part of citizens.

Second, we can choose which restaurant to go. If you hate smoke, you
should go to it that doesnÅft arrow to smoke. We can avoid them easily
unlike walking smokers. And if we think of smokerÅfs and the peopleÅfs
around smokers health, we should take other ways for example increasing
the tax of tobaccos or encouraging the restaurants which have only no
smoking seats.

To enjoy with all of us, we must give smokers the Åhroom Åh to eat with
smoking.
