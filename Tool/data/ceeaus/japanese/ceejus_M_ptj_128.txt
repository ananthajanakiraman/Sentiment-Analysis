" I agree with that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. It is because there are two reasons.  First of all, it means studying society to have a part-time job. When we graduated from college, we are not students and should work somewhere. Wherever we work, It is useful the experience of working and earn moneys.
 A lot of cases, even if student make mistakes, he is excused.  However, man take a job   is not. It is dangerous that take a job you have no experience.
 Next, college students need moneys. We have a lot of time. Of course we should study, but we donÅft want to study only. Then, we belong to club, go to karaoke with friends, have a lunch, take a trip, study abroad etcÅc Only college student can do these things. These things enable us to make really friends and wonderful memories. That is very important. However, we need moneys to do that. So we have to have a part-time job. There are students who pay school expense themselves. They must have a part-time job to study. We have things that we want to do or must to do. Perhaps it is more important for you to do that than studying.  So we need moneys.  
Therefore, I agree with that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
