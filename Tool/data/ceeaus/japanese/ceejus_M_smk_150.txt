Now, some restaurants have separated nonsmoking seats from smoking seats. But that is not effective if smoking is banned completely at restaurants. That is why we cannot stop smokes from cigarette from invading nonsmoking seats. As a result, the situation at nonsmoking seats is the same as that of 
smoking seats. Also, there are a lot of children or people who are not allowed to smoke. Smoking affects them badly by their seeing people smoke. For instance, they may snuff smokes or they may start smoking by seeing that often. In fact, the number of the children whose parents smoke smoking is mor
e than that of the children whose parents donÅft smoke. And if the man couldnÅft help smoking, he might get out of a restaurant.
 In the first place, restaurants are not where people smoke or chat but where people enjoy eating dishes. People should concentrate enjoying eating or drinking. And smoking may prevent us from eating original tastes. In short, smoking may alter tastes. Then those who smoke cannot get anything at the
 restaurant. It is true that they relax by smoking, but, at restaurants, that doesnÅft bring them anything good, but that brings people around them criticizing.
