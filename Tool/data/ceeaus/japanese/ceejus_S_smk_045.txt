Å@I go to Kobe University by train everyday. Every time I ride in the do
or in the front of a smoking are at Shinimamiya station which is on my w
ay to the school. When the train arrives there, businessmen with smoke r
ide on it. They can extinguish their cigarette but cannot remove their s
moke. The smoke is bad smell and does harm to people near the smoker.  S
o, I don't like cigarettes and smokers. Most people dislike the smell. T
he smoke left the smell with clothes, hair and rooms, and have a big bad
 influence on not only adults but children. 
Å@The Star backs Coffee bans smoking because the customers can't enjoy t
he scent of coffee with smoke.  This instance can be applied to the rest
aurant. We go to a restaurant to eat delicious dishes. So, restaurants p
rohibit smokers from smoking. If a restaurant makes nonsmoking and smoki
ng seats, a group may have to separate into two groups. It costs to desi
gn the inside of restaurants and attach exhaust system to there for maki
ng nonsmoking area. Therefore the restaurant completely banned smoking. 
Some of the many smokers want to quit smoking but can't stop because the
y are addicted. This prohibition may be good opportunity.
