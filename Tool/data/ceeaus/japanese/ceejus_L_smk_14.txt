I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. One of the reasons is that I donÅft like smoking. When I go to a restaurant, I stop entering if there are not seats not to smoke. But I could enter a restraint if there are seats to smoke and not to smoke. Some restaurants donÅft have seats not to smoke. I do want all the restaurants to have seats not to smoke. Even if a restaurant have seats not to smoke, the seats are near by seats to smoke. So the restaurants are not different from those of not having seats not to smoke.
Finally, I wish there are not tobacco in the world. But some people canÅft stop smoking. I want people not smoking to feel comfortable everyday everywhere. I think it become important to smoking peopleÅfs thinking. They can stop smoking where not smoking, or not. I want each people who smoke to consider people who donÅft smoke.
 I have friends who smoke. I ask to them why they donÅft smoke. So they all answer smoking is their habit. They smoke unconsciously. Then I hate tobacco.  
 Really, I wish there are not tobacco in the world.
