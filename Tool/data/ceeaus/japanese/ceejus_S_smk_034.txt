I donÅft smoke now. But I donÅft agree with this opinion.

Because I think smoking is one of the hobbies like as sports, reading and 
eating. So we canÅft easily interrupt smoking. And now, in many restaurants 
there are tables for smoking people and for not smoking people. If you sit 
at table for not smoking people, you can run away from annoying smokes. 
Therefore, when people who smoke sit at table for smoking people they donÅft 
make any bad things. None the less, if there are people who want to 
completely ban smoking at all the restaurant, I want to regard them as 
people who canÅft understand the free correctly and who are so selfish.

The next reason is like this. When I have smoked, it was a so wonderful time 
when smoking after good breakfasts and lunches or when smoking with drinking 
a cup of coffee. This time was the one of the best time in my life and I 
could feel happy. And I think this is the common time for smoking people 
around the world. Therefore I think the restaurants that completely banning 
smoking are unsatisfactory for smoking people. And I think the restaurants 
should be the one that giving customers perfect satisfactions.

So, I donÅft agree with this opinion.
