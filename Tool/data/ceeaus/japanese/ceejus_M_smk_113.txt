I think that everyone who smokes always and everywhere should give up smoking  at the restaurant. 

The reason is that  there are some people who dislike cigarette at the restaurant.

An act that it is smoked for the people who do not smoke during a meal is an annoying act.

There is the non-smoking seat in the restaurant, but it is still nominal.

The cigarette gives human health the bad influence.

That is why you should promote prohibition of smoking at the restaurant overall where there is a lot of people.

However, the smoker will object to prohibition of smoking.

They may insist on a right which is called the smoking.

we can eat the meal which is more delicious than now if there is no smoker  at the restaurant.

In addition, the nonsmoking flow is spreading out worldwide now. 

The cigarette does you no good and much harm. 

That is why I agree to the prohibition of smoking at the restaurant.
