"I agree with this statement because of the following reasons. 

 One of the reasons for having a part-time job is that we need some money. If we enter the college, we will have a lot of free time. However, it is wasteful to do nothing. So, we should use our free time to study, enjoy circle activities and our hobbies and so on. And if we enjoy such activities, we need some money. Thus, I agree with having a part-time job.

 Another reason for having a part-time job is that we can acquire some knowledge for job. When we choose a part-time job, we think to choose a good one for us. For example, are we paid high salaries? Is the position of working place near our college or home? Through these thinking, we can understand the standard level of labor conditions. And when we do a part-time job, we can get good experiences. For instance, we will acquire a good manner to be impolite to customers, and we can have a relationship with the employees like us and exchange information about job and so on. Thus, we can have a social study. And so, I agree with having a part-time job.
