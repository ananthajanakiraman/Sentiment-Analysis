I agree with the statement. IÅfm going to show that why I think so. 
First, college students are already almost adult. So they should not depend on their father or mother. But I donÅft say that college students must be independent perfectly. I want to say that they should reduce their parentsÅf responsibility. This is very important.
Second, doing part time job has good effect for the student. It makes a lot of opportunity to talk or communicate a lot of people, as coworker or as visitor. They have really a lot of character. When student working, he must be professional. It is very hard and severe, but such experience will give him a lot of chance to grow himself. 
Doing part time job is wonderful thing. It gives us money and something priceless called ÅeexperienceÅf. 
Students should use the money to reduce their parentsÅf responsibility. I said so. But, if student have a time and enough money, it is very good experience to go abroad. It is difficult to go abroad and communicate with foreign languages, after graduation.
So, doing part time job gives us a lot of choice. So, college students should have part time job. But, what they really should do is studying. They never forget studying always.
