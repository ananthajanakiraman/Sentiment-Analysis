Å@Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
Å@At first, I will talk about the character of a cigarette. Recently, many people dislike smoke of a cigarette. Although some people like it very much, another people donÅft like it because the smell of it is characteristic. Moreover, it is said that the smoke which flows from the cigarette that other people smokes does us harm, so this becomes another reason many people hate the smoke of a tobacco and more and more people get to avoid the smoke. So, tobacco is a thing which makes some people uncomfortable.
Å@Then, I will talk about the nature of a restaurant. Restaurant is the public place. In other words, it is the place where various people use. Among those who eat dinner in the restaurants, it is expected that there are many people who get unpleasant when they smell the smoke of a cigarette. In the public place, we should not allow people to do the behavior that makes other people unpleasant. Especially, we donÅft want to be disturbed when we enjoy eating in the restaurant. 
Å@That is why I agree that smoking should be completely prohibited at all the restaurants in Japan.
