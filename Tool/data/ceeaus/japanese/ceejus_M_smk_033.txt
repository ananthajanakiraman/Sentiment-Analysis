I  think  smoking  should  be  completely  banned  at  the  restaurant  in  Japan .  There  are  three  reasons  why  I  can  agree  with  the  ban  on  smoking .  

  First , smoking  in  restaurant  does  harm  to  non  smoker . It  is  called  passive  smoking .  Its  harm  is  as  dangerous  as  risk  smoker  has .  and  in  public  place ,  restaurant  non smoker  think  unpleasant.

  Second,  smoking  disturb  that  we  enjoy  the  dinner  taste .  even  nonsmoker  around  smoker .  and  it  is  rudeness  to  chef  in  the  restaurant .  Because,  every  chef  must  be  in  earnest  to  please  guest .

  Third,  every  restaurants  have  original  mood .  for  example, bright, adult, clean  etc. It  relate  the  restaurant,s  image  . But, smoking  destroy  the  mood  and  image . The  reputation  of  restaurant  go  bad.  Therefore  the  profit  will  be  diminished  .

I  may  overstate , however  the  restaurant  allow  smoker  to  smoke  may  go  bankrupt .

  I  explain  three  reasons.  And  I  think  smoking  affect  nonsmoker  and  the  restaurant .  So ,  every  restaurant  should    completely   ban  smoking . 

Also  I  think  smoking  area  also  should  be  removed.  Smoking  smell  hang  over  even  no smoking  area .  Limited  smoking  area  is  only  nonsense.

Finally,  smoking  should  be  banned  not  only  restaurant  but  also  other  public  place.  For  example, school  park  road  etc . Smoker  should  find  other  method  of  relaxing  and  entertainment.
