Smoking , of course , is bad for health not only of smoker but also of surroundings . However , if a low that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants is provided , a rate of crime begin to rise rapidly . Nowadays , most of crime such as murder , theft , violence , and so on are due to stress . Thinking about security of life for citizens is more precious than any other thing . Therefore , the idea should be changed to an idea that smoking should be Åg partly Åh banned at all restaurants in Japan . Namely , it is important to establish restaurants for smokers and non-smokers separately . By doing so , all smokers can smoke without thinking about trouble for surroundings and refresh themselves . Non-smokers can also enjoy eating food without stress that comes from putting up with smoke and worry about their health . WhatÅfs more , not only reduce the rate of crime but improve national economy . For instance , if Japanese government provided the idea that I have just suggested , the sale of each restaurants would rise , and of cigarettes also would rise . As a result , taxes that come from these sales are increase and are sent to government to improve life of citizens . Thus , you will find that my idea is better than the theme . When you understand my idea , you will also disagree with the theme .
