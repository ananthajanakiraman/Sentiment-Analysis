Å@I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. Of course, I know that there are many people who smoke every day. However, I think it does not need that people smoke at restaurant. I will show you my opinions.

  I do not smoke because I do not like the smell of cigarette. When I go for a meal with friends who smoke, I cannot smell and taste meals. I cannot stand the smell of cigarette. I want to eat delicious meals without the smell of cigarette. I do not smoke, so I cannot understand why people smoke at the table.

 However, it does not mean that smoking should be completely banned at all space in the world. I do not smoke, but I admit that there are people who smoke. However I think there are many people who do not like the smell of cigarette. So, when they go to restaurants, I think they smoke outside the restaurants.

  You may say that there are smoking seats and nonsmoking seats at many restaurants. However, both seats do not completely be separated. So, sometimes cigarette smoke flows to nonsmoking seats. Even though smoking seats and nonsmoking seats are separated at some restaurants, I think people who smoke should smell and taste meals without the smell of cigarette. I think it is bad manners to smoke at the table. Because, cooks want to make people happy by his cooking, they cook hard. We should appreciate his cooking. 

  I have heard that people who had smoked get fat as soon as they stopped smoking. It is because they can smell and taste meals more without the cigarette.

 So, I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants.
