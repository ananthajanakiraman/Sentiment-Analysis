I think restaurant should not be banned smorking. Many people smoke today,it is banned to smoke in restaurant, restaurant managers will close their restauranrt.
 So, I suggest that they should separate smokers and non-smokers. Smoking is uncomfortable for non-somokers,non-smoking irritating smokers. Thus two kinds of people should be separated.
