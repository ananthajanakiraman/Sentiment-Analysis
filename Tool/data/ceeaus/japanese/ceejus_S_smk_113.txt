 I  disagree with this opinion,I have three reasons.
 First, at restaurant, everyone should enjoy spending time whether he or
she is smoker or not. They spend money to enjoy eating, no one should
interrupt them. If the restaurans make all customers happy, restaurants
should set the seat for  smokers to prevent none smokers from smoke of
cigarette. For example, they should install some machines which can clear
air or rooms separated from other rooms for none smokers.
 Second,if we ban smoking at all the restaurants, smokers will not go to
restaurants so often. As a result, restaurants loose a lot of customers and
decrease their benefits. It is not good for restaurants.
 Third, why we should ban smoking at ÅgallÅh the restaurants? If you do not
like smoke, you should go to restaurants which ban smoking. We don
Åft need ban smoking at all restaurants. There are many restaurants in
Japan, if the restaurants which supply what you want to eat do not ban
smoking,  you can find other restaurants which ban smoking.
From these reasons, I am against the opinion. It is violation of the rights
of smokers to ban smoking at all the restaurants .
