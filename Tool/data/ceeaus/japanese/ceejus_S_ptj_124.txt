It is important for the college student to have a part-time job
 
I sure that part-time job is very important for us 
Of course, It is because that we can earn some money to live
However It is because that We can get a necessary thing in our society by working part-time too
Now I work as the lecturer of the private supplementary school now.
I was not able to use the honorific definitely.
I was not able to support a telephone
I was not able to keep time
Then , by working I sensed fear of society and how immature I was.
Moreover we can know importance of money by working hard
But part-time job have not only good thing.
ÅuI am student.Åv
 We must not forget it.
That is to say, we lose a lot of time to study by working but our priority is studying
Certainly it brings us many knowledge and growth but we must not do only it.
Part-time job makes our college life more great
Actually I am feeling so now
So I think that it is best that we study and have a part-time job at a same time
From now ,I am going to do so.
