“We get much harm, but no plus.”

 

There is such a proverb in Japan. This is often used about cigarette. Thus, smoking is not seen a good thing. Smoking does harm to smokers, but also nonsmokers. Cigarette has two types of smoke. One is mainstream　smoke, the other one is sidestream　smoke. Mainstream　smoke is smoke which smokers are inhaled directly. Sidestream　smoke is smoke discharged from top of cigarette.

 

Here, it is an important problem that sidestream smoke do more harm than mainstream smoke. If someone smokes in the place there are many nonsmokers, they will be done more harm than someone. And, if one of them is suffered from asthma, he may have a fit of coughing. So, smoking should be banned at the place there are many people. For example, train, shop, college school, and restaurant. It may be restriction for right of smokers. But It must not be that the right to disturb the health of others. Cigarette is obstacle for living close together.
