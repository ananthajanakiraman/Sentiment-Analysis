I disagree with that it is important for college students to have a
part-time job, because I think studying is the most important thing for
college students.
I donÅft think to have a part-time job is bad, because I think earning money
by ourselves during college students is good experience ,besides we can make
friends with person who go to other school or who is another age.
However, I think if we cannot study so much because of their part-time job,
we should not have a part-time job. The thing which we have to do during
college students is studying. We have to work every day after we graduate
college, even if we donÅft want to work. So I think that we donÅft have to
work during college students.
Of course, we donÅft have enough money if we donÅft have a part-time job, so
we may want to work and get money. Then I think we may work for a few days
in a week.
However, if we graduate college and begin working at the company, we will
not have enough time to use for ourselves, but during college students, we
have enough time to play with our friends or to use our hobby. I think there
are many things we can do only during college students. I think we should
use our time for ourselves and enjoy our college life. Therefore, I think a
part-time job is not important thing for college students.
