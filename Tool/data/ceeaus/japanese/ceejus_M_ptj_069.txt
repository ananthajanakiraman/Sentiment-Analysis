I agree to the opinion that it is important for college students to do a part time job. There are two reasons.
The first reason is through a part time job, we can learn a lot of things that we cannot learn in school. For example, we can learn etiquette and correct honorific words through service industry, and we can learn how to instruct through a tutor job. They are important skill after we go out into the world, too. Part time jobs are rehearsals of the future for college students.
	The second reason is money. College student is almost adult. So I think we must earn our cost of living by ourselves as much as we can. It is not good to be our parentsÅf burden. Through part time jobs, we can appreciate that how hard to make money is and the importance of money.
	Actuary, it is the part of students to study. It is foolish to pay very expensive school fees and sleep throughout the lecture. But I believe that it is more important to challenge various things. It will never be vain for college students to do a part time job. Hard study, hard work and delightful group activity will make the college life satisfactory.
