 I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
I have two reasons about it.
 First, college students need much money.
At college, there are many events for college studentsÅ\club activities, welcome parties for new students, and playing with their friends, for example.
It cost much money for students to attend these events.
It may be impossible, especially for students living away from their parents, to attend all these events only with monthly allowance.
And if there are unexpected expenses, material for their lesson, for example, they may not be able to pay money to it only with monthly allowance.
So to get money, students had better have a part-time job.
 Second, part-time jobs will be job training for students.
They can trial many kinds of jobs by part-time jobs.
So they can brush up their skill.
And they can communicate with many people at a work place.
So they can brush up their communication ability and learn social common knowledge.
 Because of these opinions, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
Part-time jobs are good for college students both economically and socially.
ThatÅfs all.
Thank you for your reading.
