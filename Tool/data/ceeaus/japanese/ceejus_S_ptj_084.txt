I was able to make friends with the people of various universities. ItÅ@is really happy to speak friends of various universities with various topics. It is planned to travel to various places with the friends who happily because it because it works part-time, and to make a lot of memories. I think that it should experience these things before it starts one's adult life.  It can be thought that the part-time job is a practice before it finds employment. I think that it is very important to experience the part-time job in the school days for the above-mentioned reasons. Moreover, I think it is necessary. If the part-time job was not experienced, I was housebound. The part-time job develops the person, and gives me a lot of valuable experiences.
