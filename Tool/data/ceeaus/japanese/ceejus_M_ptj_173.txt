"I agree with the statement that is important for college students to have a
part-time job. I think that it has 3 factors.
First, earning money by doing part-time jobs helps their family budget.
Generally speaking, each studentÅfs family budget consists of his or her
parent or parents income. Increasing family budget by doing part-time job
means that increase available money. In many cases, first year student will
take a great deal of money. For example, play with new friends or members of
the club which he or she is belonging to make deep friendship. Especially
the student who is living at an apartment house will take higher money than
the former.
Second, I think that main purpose of a part-time job is not only earning
money but also to get chance of meeting another sex person. This is serious
problem for students of the engineering faculty. For example, our English
oral class consists of only men! It has no women. Because of this
pessimistic situation, we should do part-time job to break down this
situation and to have girlfriend.
Finally, social experience maybe the most important factor. Wide view and
unique imagination are essential things for engineer or any other job. To
get them we have not only to learn but also to get through real.
ThatÅfs why I think this thema is important.
