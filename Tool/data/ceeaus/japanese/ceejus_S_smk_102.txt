There are many smokers in Japan, but there are non-smokers, too. In general, passive smoking is worse than active smoking by a few times. Even if a restaurant divides smoking areas and non-smoking areas, smoke flows to non-smoking areas sometimes, makes non-smokers feel bad and hurts health of everyone. Non-smokers are surrounded by smoke against their will and they get their health bad more easily than smokers, which is terrible. Restaurants are existing for eating not for smoking. In addition, all non-smokers should wait for non-smoking seats being available even though smoking seats are vacant. It is not a solution that non-smokers should put up with smoke. In the first place, it is very strange that there are seats preferred that probably hurt health in restaurants. Many people do not think that they want to hurt their health in the restaurants. Rather, smokers should avoid smoking in restaurants. I wish that smokers had a little more patience with their smoking when we had some food in restaurants. Stopping smoking is the best way to enjoy food, because after quitting smoking, people feel food more delicious than before. So, smoking must be completely prohibited in all the restaurants, not preferring smoking areas.
