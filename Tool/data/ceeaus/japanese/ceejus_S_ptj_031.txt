I think it is important for college students to have a part time job.
Firstly, this is because we can learn about many things through having a part time job.
However I have never had a part time job and I donÅft know what having part time job is.
But my friends do. One of my friend said ÅgI worked yesterday at Chinese restaurant. So, I have pain in my arm from carrying dishes.
From working we can learn how difficult living alone is, how grateful for our parents working and what society is like. These things are not learned in college and we will not discover these if we donÅft have part time job. 
Secondly, this is because we are able to find what we want to do in the future by having part time job. I think we can prepare becoming adult through going to college. I think we should be interested in many things to find a job that you want to do in the future. Having a part time job is a good chance to learn this.  Some college students have dream, some student donÅft. If you do, you can review your dream through doing many part time jobs or get chance to realize your dream. If you donÅft, you can find the job that you want to in the future by doing many part time jobs or the job that you donÅft want to. Therefore you may be able to set a goal from part time job.
 From there, I think college student should do part time job if they can. But I also think they study hard in the college. If they canÅft study because of part time job, they may have to stop doing your part time job.
