I agree to the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the
restaurants in Japan. I have four reasons for this idea. First, today,
researchers make great advances in smoking. According to their
researches, smoking is very bad for human beings` health. For example,
smoking increases a personÅfs risk of serious diseases: heart attack,
cardiovascular diseases, lung cancer and more. So, smoking is harmful
for people. Second reason is a matter of passive smoking. If a person
smoke in restaurants, people around him do secondhand smoking. Serious
disease risks of people exposed to passive smoking are higher than
people who smoke. Third, there are people who simply do not like smell
of tobacco. If you smoke in the restaurant, the smell of smoke is going
to spoil the taste of the foods served at the restaurant. So, if you
want to smoke, you should be smoke outside the restaurant. Forth,
lighted cigarettes are dangerous. If children accidentally touch it,
they burn their finger with it. In addition, cigarettes may be one of
causes of fire. So, smoker should be care of cigarettes. In summarizing,
smoking is worse than useless for people. So, I think that smoking
should be banned at all the reataurants.
