I agree with this idea. Doing a part-time job teaches us many important things.
  First, you will appreciate the value of money. And you can lighten the burden on your parents by paying a cellular phone rate, a monthly fee and so on.
  Second, you can learn manners and honorifics. These are important things to take as early as you can. And it will be very useful through your life.
Moreover you will be able to get over your weak point. IÅfve been working part-time for a cram school since this spring. This is my first part-time job. My most important job is to communicate with students. But, IÅfm not good at speaking in front of many people or talking with strangers. I decided to overcome my shyness through experiences of this job. And now I can speak without being so nervous. Practice makes perfect! You should learn from failure now. When you get older, this proverb is not always true. ItÅfs now or never.
Finally, doing a part-time job will give you chances to meet good fellow workers and ideal adults. In my workplace, about thirty college or graduate students are working. They are very kind and attractive. And they work efficiently. I respect them very much. We sometimes go to a movie theater, a restaurant and trip to communicate each other. We have a very good time. Through interaction with them I can learn manners.
For these reason, I think itÅfs good thing for college students to do a part-time job.
