"I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
There are two reasons I think so. First we need much money to spend our
  life, for example, buying some clothes or playing with our friends or
commuting from our home to our college and so on. If we donÅft have a
part-time job, our parents have to pay for doing that. We owe spending
our school life to our parents. The much money we use without having a
part-time job, the more trouble they have.
Second I think that having a part-time job become very nice experience
for us. We didnÅft have so much time doing it because of club activities
or study for entrance examination. Now, we can make more time before.
Doing it helps us study about society and something helping us some day.
Some people may say that we donÅft need doing it because we can learn it
after we graduate college. But I think that we need many experiences
through having a part-time job during we are college students because
there are many things we canÅft do after we leave in society. So I think
that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
