 I strongly believe that smoking should not be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. There are three reasons. One is that there are many causes which disturb others at restaurant. Two is that smoking is a part of life for some people. Three is that problem is solved.

 First of all, I will explain that there are many causes which disturb others at restaurant. For instance, if people next to you talk loudly, how do you feel? I think you will feel uncomfortable. However, can we ban talking at restaurant? Of course we can't. If we want to ban smoking, we should ban talking, too, because both smoking and talking disturb others. That's why we should not ban smoking at restaurant.

 Secondly, I will explain that smoking is part of life for some people. For instance, most students use mobile phones. They can't spend happy time without mobile phones. No mobile phone no life. Smoking is not different from mobile phone in terms of part of life for some people. So smoking should not be completely banned at all restaurants. 

 It is true that smoking is bad for health especially for others' health. However in order to solve this problem, there are two different seats at restaurants, seats for smokers and seats for non-smokers. It is enough to solve the problem. So we don't have to ban smoking at restaurant.

 From these points, I strongly believe that smoking should not be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan.
