In my opinion ,it is important for college students to do a part time job . Because when they graduate from the college , they have to work . If they have never done a part time job , they will have difficulty in getting accustomed to their job ,and they will not be able to manage their money and they will not be able to understand value of money . So they will ruin their life and they will bother not only their parents but also other people . So I think college students should do a part time job at least once when they are college students . But if they are not able to get a credit ,and they are not able to graduate from the college ,they should quit the part time job immediately . What I want to say is that college students should do a part time job ,if a part time disrupts their study . So I want to do a part time job some time when I am a college student and I think that I have to do a part time job some time ,though I do not still get accustomed to new college life and now I do not do a part time job .
