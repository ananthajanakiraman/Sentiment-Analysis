   I agree with the idea that it is important for college students to do a part-time job. I have three reasons.
  First, working now will be useful when we start to work in society. Through a part-time job, we can learn how to communicate with customers or our superiors. It may be difficult to acquire them soon, so now I think we should get used to them.
  Second, it must make us feel how precious money is. If we ourselves didnÅft work, we couldnÅft know how hard it is to get money. But if we realize how precious money is, we must thank our parents.
  Lastly, we can get more money if we work hard. When we become older and a regular employee in a company, we will have a little free time. But we are college students and now we have much time we can spend on what we want to do. We should do what we can do only now such as club activities or traveling abroad. Then they will become good memories and valuable experiences even if it costs a lot of money.
  As I stated, doing a part-time job have many advantages and so I think we ought to do a part-time job.
