 I agree this statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the
restaurants in Japan. There are three reasons.
 Firstly, it is because that some people donÅft like smoke. Also, people
dislike a smell of cigarette. If a man smoked beside them in a restaurant,
they would feel like their meal become more awful.
 Secondly, it is because that smoking is bad for our health. In fact, a lot
of people get cancer of the lungs every year because of smoking. In
addition, the cigarette smoke gives bad effect to people who are around a
smoker. Surely, smokers have a right which they can smoke, but they should
not give people who are around them troubles.
 Thirdly, it is because that increasing nonsmoking places in any public
places would result that the number of people who smoke and suffer from a
disease of the lungs decreases. It is difficult for smokers to quit smoking.
As a matter of fact, my uncle tried to quit smoking in the past, but he
still smokes now. However, if the number of place where people cannot smoke
increased, smokers would be forced to give up smoking and the chance which
people can smoke would decrease.
 For these three reasons, smoking had better be completely banned at all the
restaurants.
