"I agree with college students having a part-time job. I have the two reasons. The first reason is that we need money to have a pleasant campus life. We want to play with our friends, for example we want to go to amusement parks and go on a trip, and do what we can do only now, and for example we get a driver license and of course for studying buy books or something to study. To do them, we have to spend money. The second reason is that we can get a lot of experiences from a part-time job. Because I do a part-time job, I am learning how hard working is, manners as a worker and importance of money. So before we graduate from university and work, we have to practice working and get experiences through doing a part-time job. Of course we should not be lazy of studying by doing a part-time job too much time. But most college students, including me, understand studying is more important than doing a part-time job. So only if we are not crazy about doing a part-time job, we can get good effects, experiences and of course money. So I agree with college students having a part-time job.
