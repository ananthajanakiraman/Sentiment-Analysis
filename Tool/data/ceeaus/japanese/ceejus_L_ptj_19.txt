I think that it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. Furthermore, I think that college students should experience many kinds of job. I have two reasons for my opinion. 
First, they should know difficulty of making many. I think if they know it, they will thank for their parents who work for them to make many and notice value of many. So they will seas to be against their parents and waste many. And I think that they can make bases of jobs by experiencing many kinds of job. The bases will help them when they start to work and make them people who have depth of humanity. I think people who have only study are foolish and not interesting and not useful at all. I think there are few people who have ability to live with only study. 
Second, I think they should relate many kinds of people. Thing I most have thought since I started a part-time job is that college are full with people like me. In college, people have similar ability of study and similar thought and similar dream and experience similar high school time and are similar age. I think it is important for us to communicate with college friends. But it is not enough for college students only communication of them. For example, I have been noticed to many things and been thought of many things by communicate with many kinds of people who have verity of thought and have experienced verity of life and are verity of ages. 
By these reasons, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
