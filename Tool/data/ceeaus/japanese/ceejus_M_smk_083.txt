Nowadays, the seats have separated for smokers and for non-smokers in most of the restaurant. However it may be meaningless, because tobaccoÅfs smoke expands around the restaurant. It makes non-smokers feel too bad. We go to restaurant for enjoying          but if there are a few people smoking while miles, the pleasure of eating will be decrease.   

Not only uncomfortable, tobacco is bad for health. For instance, people smoking well are more likely lung cancer than non-smokers. In addition, the tobacco does harm not only smokers but also non-smokers as a passive smoking. In fact, many people who donÅft smoke but whose friends or family often smoke die of diseases relating with tobacco. This is a very big problem!      

Thus, tobacco has a lot of bat thing; bad feeling, many kinds of diseases and early death or so. I cannot say to stop smoking all over the world, but at least, in restaurant where people enjoy eating delicious foods, it should be completely banned. If smoking is forbidden in restaurant, a lot of people who hate tobaccoÅfs smell will be able to more enjoy eating out. The morals of smoking must be protected by smokers more strictly. We all have the right to eat comfortably, without tobaccoÅfs smoke.
