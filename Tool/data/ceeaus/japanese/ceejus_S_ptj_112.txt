I agree with college students who have a part-time job.

Because working is replacing time by money, students can spend time effectively.

In Japan it is often said that a period of time of university is a moratorium, but they eager to make good use of the period. In fact, they donÅft like free time.

To try to reduce free time, they study, play with their friends, go to the club to which they belong, and have a part-time job.

The thing which they have a part-time job is a reasonable selection for college students who want to cut free time.

They can get some money if they go to a part-time job. 

I think that a time of university is a time of  investment in our own future.

Though college students could have the choice to work after they graduate from high school, they go to university, and they also go to a part-time office to work.

It seemed a mistake. But it is not a mistake because an investment is indispensable some money. Here is a problem.

College students will face the problem that they have to get money for investment by myself

Its solution is a part-time job.

So, we can conclude that a part-time job for college students is reasonable because they can consume their precious free time effectively and get some money to invest.
