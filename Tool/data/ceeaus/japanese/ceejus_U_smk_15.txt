Nowadays, the world is becoming harder to live in for smokers. If smoking in restaurants is thoroughly restrained by law, it means the denial of diversity of restaurants or individual lifestyles. Law should exert in the way that people can enjoy their freedom to the maximum extent, but the ban works in the other way around. Restaurants have the right to provide the regulation by themselves. Therefore even the restaurants only for smokers should be permitted. This can be one of the business strategies in this non-smoker oriented society. And people who want to smoke have the right to do so. While, it is true that non-smokers have to be protected from secondhand smoking. The obstacle to realizing all of these is in the restaurants which have two sections: for smokers and for non-smokers. Almost no people smoke in the non-smoking section. But if the non-smoking section is not completely separated from the smoking one, people who hate cigarettes end up exposing to smoke from the other compartment. So what really should be prohibited is incompletely separated smoking and non-smoking sections. This counterpart allows people to avoid or enjoy smoking and restaurants to make their rule on their own. The diversity and freedom of choice would be highly respected. When there is a moderate counterpart, a strict ban should not be adopted.
