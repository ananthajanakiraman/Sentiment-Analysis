I agree with this statement.
I have worked at a convenience store until six months ago. I learned a lot of things from this experience. 
 Those who work at convenience store are always required to be kind for every customers. For example, when an old woman whose eyes are very wrong comes to our store, we must take money from her wallet ourselvies. When we find an injured man over the door, we must run and open the door for him to come in comfortably. When foreign people who cannot understand Japanese comes to use copy machine or ATM, we must operate the machine instead of them. Some customers donÅft say Ågthank you Åh. I was sometimes sad a little. However, occasionally I could feel happiness. For example, when the man who seems to be very quiet and angry said  Ågthank you Åh with smile, and when I can talk about the weather of the day with women who often come to our store, I was very glad. The customers of convenience store cannot be restricted to their age and work, so I could meet much kind of people who I could never see in campas. Thanks to this experience, I have learned skills to change a way of communication case by case. 
It is important especially for college students to learn such a skill. That are reason I agree with the statement.
