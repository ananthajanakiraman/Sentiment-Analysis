I donÅft agree with this opinion, and I have couples of reasons why I donÅft. So I will show you what they are like.

First of all, it is true that smoking is such a nuisance for those who donÅft smoke. My mother really hates people with the habit of smoking. If she happens to take a seat close to a smoker, she will keep making a face till we leave the restaurant. However, no matter how non-smokers are suffered from it, I think that it should be up to smokers. I mean, we shouldnÅft rely on prohibiting thing but developing its moral.

For the second, there is a growing number of non-smokers or ex-smokers these days, but it is true that there are still so many people who love cigarette. So I think it is not fare for them to banning smoking at all restaurants. And it is really a problem for the nicotine-addicts. 

For these reason I give, I donÅft agree with that opinion. I think we shouldnÅft be so radical. We should be calmer down, and give the problem a careful look. I think this problem is complicated, so we had better try to respect each other and each circumstance.
