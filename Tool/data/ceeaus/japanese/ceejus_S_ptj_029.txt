I disagree to the opinion,"it is important for college students to have a part time job". Certainly, students can get knowledge of jobs or social manners and get some money through working. But in college life, there are a lot of things that they can do because of their position as a college student. For example, studying or to join volunteer works or club activities. Especially, it is bad for college students to neglect studies. I think the most important thing for them is studying. 
In addition, they can work anytime after they will have graduated from school, so they don't have to work from now. It is a privilege of students that they don't have to work. 
However, I don't mean that they must not have a part time job.  Of course, as they get used to their life, they probably want some money to play or buy things. But I have a worry that their part time jobs are so hard that they can't spend their time usefully. So I think if they can do that, there are no problems.
From such reasons, I think, if anything, it's not important for college students to have a part time job, but it is not necessarily bad for students to have it. It's a use of their time that counts.
