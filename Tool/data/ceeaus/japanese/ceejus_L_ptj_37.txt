"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I
have some reasons why I agree with this opinion.
First of all, many college students need money. Especially, I have
little money because I am living alone. I have to buy foods, furniture,
drug, and so on with my own money.
Second, I will be able to learn many things, which we can not learn at
college if I have a part-time job. For example, I will be able to learn
about courtesy. This is more important for me than school education when
I become a member of society. To be a useful person in the future, it is
indispensable to have a part-time job.
Third, I will be able to find that [money is important]. Now, I use the
money which my parents. And, I waste money. However, I save money when I
use the money which I earn with spending herd time. So I come to be
thankful to parents.
From those reasons, I agree with this opinion. However, I do not have a
part-time job now. So I am going to find a part-time job which suitable
for me by summer vacation. Thank you.
