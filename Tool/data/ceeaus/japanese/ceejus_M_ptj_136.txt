"It is important for college students to have a part-time job.
I agree this opinion. I have some reasons.
First, it is good to experience a part-time job. Everyone will become a working member of society in the near future. Having a part-time job is preparation for being it.
Actually, I began to work at the wedding reception. My work is to serve foods and drinks, to give good service and to prepare the table sets etcÅc I must learn many many things (manners, special terms, menu, customs, behaviorÅc) by heart and many times I was scolded by my boss when I failed.
But, I could understand a lot of things there. For example, to work is severe, a pay is weight, it is important to be responsible for my work, and so on. Working there is very hard, but I feel that I am very glad to work worth doing. 
Secondly, college students have a free time. If you need some money for what you want to do, you should get money not from your parents but by working on your own. So you will find money important and appreciate your parents who work for you. 
For the reasons stated above, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
