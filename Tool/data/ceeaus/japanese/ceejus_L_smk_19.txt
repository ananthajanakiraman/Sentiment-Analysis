I agree with this idea. I think two ideas to opposite smoking in restaurant.

 First, smell of smoking spoil food. Taste of food depends on smell and sight. For example, if you are said that you must eat such a favorite food in the bathroom of the station, you would refuse eating food. Because, you think that you cannot eat food deliciously in the bad smell. That is why if I smell smoking when I am eating I cannot eat food tasty. There may be people who donÅft think smell of smoking uncomfortable. But such a people are minority. Most of the people who not smoke feel uncomfortable by smell of smoking. For such a people, I ask smokers not to smoke when they are eating. 

Second, smoke is too bad for our health. Of course smokers tend to become lung cancer. But, people who smell smoking are more dangerous. Smell of smoking is poison to people who want to live healthy. I think, it is adult manner to take care about surroundings. If all the people save manner, we can eat food comfortably for each other.

 Under two reasons, I object to smoke at all the restaurant in Japan.
