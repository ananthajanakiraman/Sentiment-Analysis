I agree it is important for college students to have a part time job. Some people will say that purpose of college students is ÅgstudyÅh. I agree with this opinion, however, I think that Ågvarious experiencesÅh is purpose of college students too. 
 Firstly, I think that college students can experience work by doing part time job. After college students graduate from the college, they have to work. Therefore, I think that the experience of doing part time job is important.
 Secondly, I think that it is important for college students to experience of traveling various places and play with friends and etc however, those experiences need a lot of money. Then, it is necessary to do the part-time so that college students earn the money.
 Thirdly, I think that college students can meet various and many people through the part time job. It is important for college students to communicate with other college students and people of society.
 For these reasons, I agree it is important for college students to have a part time job.
