"I agree with an opinion that a college student should have a part-time job.



First, we can understand the mechanism of society a little by working 
part-time.

Almost of we have worked little before, but itÅfs OK because we have a lot 
of things to do in our high school days,

 for example, club activity or study for examination etc.

But, I think that we need preparations to work so that we can live by 
ourselves.

I have begun to work as the part-timer of the lecturer in a cram school 
recently.

I wonder that I am excellent as I am called a teacher by children.

Because I am still a university student, the society does not watch me with 
so strict eyes,

 but I will not pardoned if I do similar thing after 4 years.



Second, we can reduce a financial burden to depend on our parents by working 
part-time.

According to a certain data, higher than half of the university students 
live apart from a parent.

I live in a home, but my older brother lives alone in Tokyo to go to 
university.

Parents have to pay a rent or the food expenses as well as school expenses,

so we I think that we should earn the money to play by oneself.



I think the university student to work part-time from these reasons.

I want to have a various experience through a part-time job from now on.
