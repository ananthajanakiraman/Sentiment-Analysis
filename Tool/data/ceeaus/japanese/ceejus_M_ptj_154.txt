"In my opinion, college students should have a part-time job.

First reason, college students are said to be a work adults. But I think that we cannot understand real society until we work in there. Seeing is believing.

At second, college students have a summer vacation for two months. What are you going to do in summer vacation? Most people accept to study is a studentÅfs duty. I agree this opinion. But I think most students cannot study everyday for two months in fact.

 At third, we have came college from many places. This is why we do not have so many real friends. When we have a part-time job, we can make real friends in other colleges and human relations so easily. If we have human relations, we will be helped by it when we were in troublesome. Perhaps we can have a precious boy or girl friend.

 At fourth, we can get money by working. We can freely buy anything, play games, and go anywhere, and so on. But only exciting is not a value of making money. When we make money by ourselves, we would understand real value of money. If we understand it, we will not waste our money.

 At Last, we will get a job in a future. If we had a part-time job, its experience would be useful.

 Many college students have each part-time job. We should have a part-time job. It will be very good experience surely.
