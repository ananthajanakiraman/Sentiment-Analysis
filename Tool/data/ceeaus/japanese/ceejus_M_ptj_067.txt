I agree that college students do a part time job. It is because they can learn many things and spend time usefully. In fact, I do a part time job. I understand that it is very hard to earn.  So I came to save money. In addition, I could learn the importance of human relations and consideration for others. By doing a part time job, I could grow up. Before they get out into the world, they should do a part time job. And they should know how hard it is to earn. But they shouldnÅft neglect their duty. Their duty is studying. I think it is most important to study for college students. If they neglect their duty because of a part time job, they should quit a part time job. But if they have too much time on their hands and play without studying, they should do a part time job. 
Through a part time job, I could learn that I must have the responsibility for my job as a member of society. It is the important thing for us living in society. I want to be a person who takes the responsibility for my job in the future. And I want them to be such a person. That is why I recommend college students to do a part time job.
