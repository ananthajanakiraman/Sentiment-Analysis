I donÅft like tobacco, so I never smoke. I think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. It is well known that smoking has a big risk causing some disease, for instance rung cancer. Not only a person who smokes but also a person who is near a smoker might be influenced by smoking because of its smog. It is a very serious problem that a person who does not smoke is influenced by smoking. It isnÅft necessary to smoke at the restaurant. When he or she wants to smoke, he or she can smoke outside before or after eating. The smog of smoking, as I said, has a bad influence for our health, and furthermore, some people feel the smog uncomfortable. If all of people smoke or all of people donÅft mind the smog of smoking, of course everyone doesnÅft have to hesitate smoking at the restaurant. There are many people, however, who hate smoking including me. Such people will be very annoyed if there is a person who smokes during their dinner. In order not to annoy such people, smoking should be completely forbidden. It seems that people who smoke might feel bad if smoking is banned at all restaurants. By forbidding smoking at the restaurant, however, many people can eat without feeling uncomfortable.
