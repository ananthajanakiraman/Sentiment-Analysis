I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
I have two reasons for I think so.
One reason is to make money.
First, the purpose of having part-time job is to make money. Why college students have part-time job? The reason is something like this. Many college students leave their home town and live alone near the college. It takes too much money for their students. For example, the house rent, the cost of living and so on.
Some their parents pay the house rent and sent some money to their child, but it is not enough for the students. So many college students must have part-time job, and make money for them.
The other reason is more important. It is to have social experience.
Many college students , after graduating from their college ,find employment and work at the company. Before working at the company , to have part-time job during college students.
In fact, I have part-time job now. The income is very important and necessary for me.
And I could know how important the money is and, how much I have relied on my parents. The experience was very important for me.
From such thing I think it is important for college students to have part-time job.
