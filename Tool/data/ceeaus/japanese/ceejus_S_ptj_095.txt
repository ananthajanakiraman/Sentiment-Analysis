"I agree with  the  idea  that  it  is  important  thing  for  college  student to have  a  part  time  job.  Of course, we need money to buy what we

want,  such  as  clothes  or   motor bike,  or  to  pay  money  for  club activity.

Since our parents pay our educational expenses, we should make money

for our enjoyment.  But  I think  we  can  see  part time  jobs  in  a  different
viewpoint.
 
After  graduation,  almost  all  of  us  will  have  a  job,  and  continue  to 
work  in  the same  company  all the  life.  So  it  is  now  that  we  can 
experience  many  kinds  of  job.
 
However,  I  think   we  should not   spend  all  of  our  free  time  to  our  part  time  job.  There  are  many  things  which  we  can  do  only  now.We  are  able  to  make  money  after  we  graduate  from  university.We  should  think  of  having  a  part  time  job  as  a  tool  for  knowing many  worlds,  such  as  education world,  bridal  world ,  or  food  world. There must be some chances to make us   think about   our   future.
 
For  these  reason,  I think  it  is  meaningful  thing  for  college  student  to
have a part time  job.
