"I agree that.

 

I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job because two reasons.

 

First, we must study except for academic things, too.

After graduation, many of them will be pushed for time as a true member of society. But itÅfs very hard to take part in a society without arrangements. So I think we should have a part-time job as arrangements of a member of society. There are many important things which we can study only through the working. 

And we must know how money is precious. If we live by only parentÅfs income, and get allowances, we canÅft realize real value. However we understand its value in mind, itÅfs nonsense. Seeing is believing. We can realize it precious only own experience.

 

Second, I think we should do something while we are college students because for many students campus life is final time which they can use freely. 

For example traveling abroad, to learn how to drive, however they are very expensive. So we need a lot of money. But its true value rise when we carry out from preparation of money to practice on our own. 

 

 

I think we can spend time efficiently this series of flow by having a part-time job. 

4 years is too short to waste.
