I think that it is important for college student to have a part time job. Almost all of college students get the job after their graduation. So, I think that to have some part time jobs is the chance for college students to think about their lifetime jobs. These days, 30% of new members of society graduated a college or university quite their job within three years. Why do they quite their jobs so quickly?  I think that it is due to their no, little, or short thinking about their jobs. Most of the college students start to think and search about their jobs when they are 3rd grade. It is when they have to think about it. But, by working in part time jobs, they can have a chance to start to think about their jobs. To think about their jobs early in their college life is very important. So, they can worry about their job longer, and may have a good idea about their social life. By doing so, it will lead them to good result. In addition, by working in part time jobs, they can touch the society which they will live after graduation. No matter how little they know about the society, it is big difference whether they know about the society or not. And it is far bigger difference whether they can think about their jobs with the knowledge, or not.
