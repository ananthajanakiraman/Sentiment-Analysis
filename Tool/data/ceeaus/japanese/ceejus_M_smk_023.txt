I think it is very good that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. There are some reasons so that I think so. 
The first reason is because I donÅft like the cigarette. I dislike the smoke of the cigarette which other people smoke, and of course I donÅft smoke. So, I donÅft want to be disturbed the meal at the restaurant by the smoke of the cigarette of other people.
The second reason is because the cigarette has a bad influence on a body. Smoking cause the diseases such as the lung cancer, if it is terrible, there can be the mortal thing to smoker. In addition, the harm of the cigarette extends to not only the smoking person himself but also the person of the circumference. By passive smoking, the family of the smoker is easy to come to suffer from diseases such as lung cancer, too. 
The last reason is because even if we separate smoking seats from non-smoking seats, I think that we cannot intercept smoke completely. The eating people will feel unpleasantly when smoke comes.
As conclusion, from these reasons, I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
