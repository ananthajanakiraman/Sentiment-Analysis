I disagree with the opinion smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. 
 There are three reasons why I think so. First, people who smoke frequently or who canÅft stop smoking can not relax to eat lunch or dinner in a restaurant or are hesitate to enter a restaurant. Then, the number of people who eat foods in restaurants and income will decline, and managers of restaurants will be in trouble. Restaurants should meet all the customerÅfs demands.
 Second, smoking people have the right to smoke. I think that only the non-smoking peopleÅfs right should not be respected. Particularly, in a restaurant which people often use, such a regulation should not be strengthened. In Japan, where people make a point of rights, we all the more should not do so. 
 Third, I think there is a better method than the opinion if smoking is too much annoying. In the restaurants, we divide the room into smoking area and non-smoking area. So, smoking people can smoke without concerning and non-smoking people arenÅft exposed smoke.   
 Because of these three reasons, I disagree with this opinion..
