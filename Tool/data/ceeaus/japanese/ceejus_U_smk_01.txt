 I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Because, if there are some people who is smoking at a restaurant, surrounding people can be uncomfortable by harmful and smelly smoke when they are enjoying a meal. Smoke affects not only human body but also feelings of people who do not smoke. And, most of restaurants in Japan have a nonsmoking section and a smoking section, but, people who is in a nonsmoking section can not necessarily avoid smoke. Nonsmoking people who go to a restaurant with smoking people also have to eat at smoking section even if they do not like smoke. And also, the purpose of people who go to restaurant is not smoking but eating tasty food, so, people should taste only food. Cooks will hope this too. Moreover, value of smoking is nearly nothing. Smoking harms human body, and people who smoke have an increased risk of developing lungs cancer, so, banning smoking at many places may prevent smoking people to smoke and help to prevent illness. So, if smoking is banned at all restaurants, not onlyÅ@nonsmoking people become happy, but also smoking people may be able to improve health condition. From these reasons, I think that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
