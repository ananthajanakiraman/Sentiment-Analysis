 It is important for college students to have a part- time job.
 
 I agree that the part-time job is important for college student.
 Of course the most important reason is to make money to live. But for that, I must save money.
 However, the purpose is not only money. We can get more many things.
 I have been working part-time job for about two years. I have learned many things there.
 First of all, I learned communication skills. During working, I am taking communication with colleague. 
 Next, I learned that working is very hard. 
 I was surprised that working is so harder than I thought.
 I feel money is so importantÅ@and valuable. I think I have to the importance of money.
 When working at the society in my near future, that experience should be useful.
