I think we shouldnÅft make it a rule to prohibit smoking in a restaurant.
Everyone has right to do what he or she wants as far as they donÅft harm other people.
 Many says the smoke from the cigarette harm other people. I think so too, but is that only the smoke?
We use a car and it makes terrible noise or exhaust gas. Those harm other people too, however we donÅft have the idea that we should prohibit driving a car.
 What is the difference between these cases?
I think we canÅft take them right to do what they want easily whatever they do.
 In deed I really hate smoking. The smoke makes my clothes smell and it feels me sick.
 For people like me, I think there should be some rules to avoid the smoke.
Nowadays many restaurants separate the area the one is for non-smoker and the other is for smoker. This is very good idea.
 I think there are many opinions to this problem and there are many ideas to solve this problem. However only I can say is that we shouldnÅft make rules easily.
 So I disagree that smoking should be burned at all restaurants in Japan.
