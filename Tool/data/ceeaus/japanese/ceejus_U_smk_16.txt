I disagree with the opinion that smoking should be 
completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
Å@It is true that smoking is bad for others around as 
well as for smokers themselves, but those who want to 
smoke have a right to do so. We should not care about 
only non-smokers and should accept smokersÅf rights. 
At restaurants some places where you can smoke have to 
be prepared. As long as smoking is not legally prohibited, 
it seems unreasonable to try to exclude smokers.
Å@I have suggested that we should admit smokersÅf rights, 
and of course, we must also pay attention to non-smokersÅf ones. 
In order to respect them, restaurants have only to completely 
separate the seats for smokers and for non-smokers. It appears 
much better that they separate even the rooms for both if you 
take into account that smoke may go around. What is important 
is that restaurants need to make both smokers and non-smokers 
have a good time there because they are customers.
Å@Thus I think that smoking should be partially admitted at 
all the restaurants in Japan and that restaurants should 
prepare the places such as the seats and even the rooms 
for smokers and non-smokers.
