"I agree that students do part time jobs.

I think that working hard to get money is important and necessary.

When we get some money, we can live our richer lives.

Those who don't agree this might think that working declines students' studying time.

And they also think that studying is students' duty.

I slightly agree them. It is common sense.

But I think that what is good for their lives in university is not only studying.

They have to do other things except for studying.

They are students in university and human beings.

Human beings have to communicate with others.

What they do so is what they spend money. Because they are students in university.

University and high school have a lot of great differences.

I think that one of them is atmosphere among its students. 

High school students are still childish, but university students are almost adult.

So they tend to and are natural to acts in the way adults do.

To act in that way needs a lot of money. So they have to work to get money.

If they do not work, they have to rely on their parents' money.

To rely on their parents' money completely is too bad. The money is for their living.

To spend the money is rude for their parents. 

For these reasons, I agree that students do part time jobs.
