" I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are three reasons why I agree.

  First, you can get money. In college school life, you need much money to buy books, go shopping with friends, drink with members of club activity, and so on. So if you have a part-time job, you can use money as you want. As for me, I have a part-time job for the trip to meet my host family in Canada with a friend of mine.

  Second, you can make new human relations.
There are many generations in a work place.
For example, owner, a person who is a housewife and a person who belongs to other college. If you don't have a part-time job, you make friends in only your university.

  And last, you can grow larger as a member of society.
 When you were child, you were protected enough. But as you grow up, you have to manage yourself. So you can learn  many things through a part-time job. For example, a friend of mine works at cram school. She seems to be busy preparing for her class. But she always says that she can have a responsible for her students and learn many things from them.
Thus, there are many advantages about having a part-time job. In order to make your school life more benficial, you should have a part-time job."
