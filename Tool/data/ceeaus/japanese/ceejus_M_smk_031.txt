 I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan, for there are the four following reasons. Firstly, I hate smoking because I have smoked myself sick and while I was walking downtown recently, the man in front of me tapped his cigarette, and almost made a hole in my clothes. Secondly, if people are in the room filled with thick, people are exposed to secondhand smoke. This is dangerous to us, because secondhand smoke is deadly poison. So the person should not smoke at the restaurants. Thirdly, when many of people look at smoker at the restaurant, the cheerful mood is broken by the smoker. We go home with our disappointed look. And the restaurant managers are at a loss, as visitor does not spend much money eating and drinking in the restaurant owing to the smoker. As the result, the smokers may lead the restaurant to bankruptcy. Lastly, when people smoke in the restaurants, there is the heap of cigarette ashes at the restaurants. The garbage is thrown away by employees. This means that the restaurant managers must pay extra cash to employees. The managers canÅft put up with the spending. According to four problems, I am opposite to smoking at the restaurants in Japan. ThatÅfs all. Thank you for your reading.
