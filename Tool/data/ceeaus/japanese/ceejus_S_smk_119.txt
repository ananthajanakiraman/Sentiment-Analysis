There are many arguments for and against about smoking. 

I think it is good idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan, because smoking has no effective and good points.

I know a lot of smokers may smoke to distract them mind from them worries and get rid of them stress in them dairy life. Smokers feel good when they are smoking, but it is temporary pleasure.
Smoking is incriminated as the major cause of lung cancer.  Heavy smoker will suffer terrible pain from smoking. Not only smokers, but also passive smokers will suffer any problems.  ItÅfs too bad.
Then, I have a suggestion. To do exercise, hobbies are better way to escape from them stress. They should go out side and run or fun to sport, not go smoking room. We can escape our stress in another way. 

It will be difficult to carry out this plan. But, smoker should be more sensitive to non-smoker at every space.
To be in good health and not to feel uncomfortable in fun lunch time, I think we should ban smoking at all the restaurants in Japan and all over the world. 

LetÅfs enjoy eating and talking in the restaurant!
