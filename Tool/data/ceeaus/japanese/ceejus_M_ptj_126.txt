I think it is very important for college students to work a part-time job. First reason, we, college students are almost members of society, and we are going to have to work at an organization few years later. Therefore I think we have to practice to work at an organization, and to work a part-time job is the best occasion for it. If we are still in a student mood when we enter a company, we are scolded and said familiar words ÅgWhat are recent young men!Åh by our bosses or superiors. For it wonÅft be so, we should acquire manners as a member of society, how to talk respect words, and so on while we are college student who have much time. Even a part-time job, when working as a part of society, we can learn those important things. Second, I think it is miserable that a college student who is close to 20 years old depends on their parents. There seem to be a member of society called ÅgParasite singleÅh, but it is ashamed that a college student gets money from their parents. From above two reasons, I think it is important to work a part-time job, and college students should work a part-time job.
