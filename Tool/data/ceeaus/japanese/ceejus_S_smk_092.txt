I agree to this idea. I think Japanese government should prohibit smoking at all the restaurants in Japan.
I hate smoking. Smoking is bad for the health. I want to be sure to take good care of myself. And if someone smoke by me, my clothes get smell. I must suffer from my clothesÅLtobaccoÅLs smell.
If someone smoke at the table, it get me more irritant. I like to eat, so, I want to eat in comfortable situation. Tobacco makes this situation and mood bad.
Because of like these reason, I disagree to smoking at the restaurant.
If it is allowed, I want to prohibit tobacco it self. For example, if the government impose a more high tax on tobacco, there are few smoker in Japan.
I think, when smoker want to smoke, they should go the place there are no people.
So the government should increase smoking room by tobaccoÅLs tax. If  it come true, we donÅLt have to inhale tobaccoÅLs smoke.
But it is true that there are many people love smoking.
So if they that there are want to smoke, I want to them smoke where not cause us annoying.
I want the Japan to be the cantury where the air is clean and not float bad smells.
