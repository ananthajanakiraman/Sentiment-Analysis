"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
The first reason is that I think a part-time job is one of the
experience program in job.  When I was a junior high school student, my
school made such a program.  It called ÅgTry yaru weekÅh.  Then I go to
the fire station.  I decided that I will be a fire fighter through the
experience.  And the second reason is that we cannot manage for money.
College students often eat and drink with their friends.  In other
words, they use much money to eat and drink.  If they donÅft have a
part-time job, they cannot do that.  And their friends may think that
the person is no good in companionship.  Unluckily it may cause a
quarrel, and cut down his friends.  Third reason is that they want the
money to buy various things.  In my case, I want to buy fashionable
cloths.  But they are too expensive to buy.  Therefore I think that a
part-time job is important for college students.  But we are college
students, arenÅft worker.  It is most important for us to study!!  We
must not only have a part-time job but also study.  We must not forget
that why do we go to KOBE university!
