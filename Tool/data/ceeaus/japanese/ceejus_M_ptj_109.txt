"I agree with this opinion, because I think we should experience work and gradually accustom ourselves to the rule of our society. I have already had a part-time job. First I felt that I can do well, because my friend who started to work a month ago told me that job was very interesting. But it was not easier than I thought. When I am working, I feel the difference between customer and worker all the time. One day I did mistakes with which I got angry if I was customer. And after I felt disappointed very much. Another day I was told ÅgthanksÅh by a customer. And I felt very happy. I think this experiment is very important for me to become a member of society.

 I think college students should pay the cost of living on oneÅfs own too. Until high school student, I took 2000 yen a month from my mother. So I used them for my pocket money, such as lunch, stationery, books, and arcade games. But now I am a college student who should prepare to stand on my feet. So I think we should pay them by my money which I earned.
