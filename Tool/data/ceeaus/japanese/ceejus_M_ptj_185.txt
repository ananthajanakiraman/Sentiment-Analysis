I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. 
One reason is that college students need money to play or have meals with their friends. For college students, to be with their friends is very precious. So, in order to enjoy college life, they need to have a part-time job and earn money.
The other reason is that they should get use to working before they graduate from college. I think society is severe and really different from college. If we donÅft work hard, we may lose our jobs. When we work, we have a lot of chances to work with people who are in different posts from us. In order to do well with them, we need experiences.  I have a part-time job and I realize that it is difficult to earn money and that working is not interesting. Many students have a part-time job two or three days per a week. I think that is good because we should get use to society gradually. 
I have a friend who works in a restaurant. She works until a.m. two or three oÅfclock. So she is often late for the class. I think she is wrong. We students should think of studying first. When we go out in to the world, we can work midnight many times but we canÅft have time to study. So, in my opinion, we should have a part-time job which doesnÅft have effect on our college life.
