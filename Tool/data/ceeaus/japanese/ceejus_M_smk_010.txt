I think that smoking should not be banned at all restaurants in Japan. Of course, a lot of studies show that smoking is harmful not only for smokers, but also the people around smokers. Smoking causes the lung cancer; it almost becomes a commonsense.
 However, many smokers continue to smoking although they know the commonsense. A study shows that otherwise once a person is used to smoking, it is difficult that he gives up smoking, smoking help smokers concentrate on their works, or make smokers feel relax. These effects make it more difficult for smokers to give it up. 
Restaurants are the places where people feel comfortable and relax through the dishes. If smoking is banned at all restaurants, those who make it a rule to smoke a cigarette after eating will feel uncomfortable. The owners who manage restraints should not make them feel such uncomfortable feelings and they will not.
This is why I insist that smoking should not be banned at restaurants. On the other side, it is also important that those who donÅft smoke should not feel uncomfortable because of smokers. The owners should make effort as well as they can. If it becomes true, more people have more comfortable and better times.
