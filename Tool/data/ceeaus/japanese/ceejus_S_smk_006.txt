 I agree with this opinion because I hate it very much personally. In addition, I donÅft like its smoke because no one smokes in my family. Then I would like to explain three more reasons in the following passage.
     Firstly, if there are some people who are smoking in the restaurant, the air around me also becomes bad. If all the people in the restaurant smoked, no one would feel bad with the air. But some people smoke. Others donÅft smoke. I think that we should take more consideration into the latter than the former.   
     Secondly, smoking does harm with not only the smoking person but also others around him. In addition, I have heard that the smoke does more harm with people who donÅft smoke than smoking people. In such a place as restaurants, more and more people will be broken their health.
     Thirdly, dishes become not delicious by breathing the smoke. Even if the dishes which we like very much are carried in front of me, we wonÅft be able to enjoy eating by breathing the smoke. I think we should concentrate on enjoy eating in restaurants.
     For these reasons, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
