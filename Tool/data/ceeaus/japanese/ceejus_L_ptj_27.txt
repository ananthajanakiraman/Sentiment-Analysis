I agree on working part-time of university students. I have some reasons why I agree on working part-time. Firstly, in university, we can study society with only books. With only books, there are many things that we donÅft know about real society. We had better really work part-time and understand difficulty of earning money, working with many people, and so on. Secondly, we students needs much money when we do everything. We want to do very funny things that we can not do in school days, such as traveling world, playing with friends, loving girl friend, and so on. These things cost much money, so we need much money. We may rely on parents, but we should live by ourselves as diligent as we can. Thirdly, we had better make friends as many as we can make. It is the most important thing in my life and school life. I suppose that student should not study but make more friends. Friends is more important property than food, water, money and so on. So, we had better part in working part-time, we should much more friends in not only university but also part-time-job. In such ways, letÅfs enjoy school-days and make it very significant thing.
