I agree the idea which smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.

Smoking is bad for your health, you know.

So, if you smoke, it influences people around you by passive smoking.

Passive smoking means nonsmokers lose their health by otherÅfs smoke.

According to the survey, if parents are smokers, their children will have worse health than children whose parents are nonsmokers will in the future.

However, even if someone makes effort to keep his or her condition by nonsmoking, he or she may lose his or her health by smokers around him or her, sitting next to smokers in the restaurants for instance.

And, what was worse, nowadays, the number of smokers who cannot obey the rule about smoking in public has increased.

Someone smoke in the nonsmoking area without thinking other people.

They seem to be indifferent about how other people have trouble by their smoke.

In these reason, I think that the rule about smoking should be more and more strictly.

The most important thing which we should think immediately is to keep everyoneÅfs health good.

So, I agree that we should make the law which prohibits smoking at all the restaurants in Japan.
