I think that smoking should completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. Th
ere are four reasons to explain my opinion. Let me introduce the reasons.
 First, the smell of smoking is so bad for not only smoking people's health bu
t also non-smoking people's health. Perhaps smoking people accept some bad eff
ects for their health, but people who don't smoke don't want to be a patient b
ecause of smoking effects. And if there are some effects for non-smorking peop
le, smoking people don't have any responsible for that nevertheless the people
 who smoked nearby the effected people who don't smoke is them.
 Second, if there is a restaurant in which anybody can smoke, the income will 
decrease. Because some of the people who don't smoke don't go to the restauran
t. They hate the smell and the smoke, and they go through the restaurant as so
on as looking at the smoking people in the it.
 Third, the restaurant in which anybody can smoke is bad for the people who ha
ve been smoked and try not to smoke. If there is the restaurant, perhaps some 
of the people will smoke. 
 Fourth, I don't like smoking people. 
 So I agree with the opinion. I think that restaurants should be the place in 
which nobody smoke.
