"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
 We should do a lot of things in our life as many as possible. When we
are college students, we have free time very much. So we have chance to
do a lot of things.
 We should have a part-time job even if only one because it teach us the
importance of earning and working for people. My parents send me money
now, so I do not know the importance of earning and working for people.
 If I would not work until graduating KOBE University and I would start
to work not as student, what happened to me? I think I could not go well
in the company and the society because I do not know the importance of
earning and working for people.
 And a part-time job teaches us that it is hard and difficult to work to
get money. No matter how hard we work for an hour, we often get 800 yen
or so. Probably we think ÅgONLY 800!Åh
 I think, when we understand those importance, we will know appreciate
my parents as ÅgThanks to my parents working hard, I can go to KOBE
University and learn.Åh That may be most importance of having a part-time
job."
