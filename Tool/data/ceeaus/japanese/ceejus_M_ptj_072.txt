I agree to the opinion that itÅfs important for college students to do a part time job.    I have some reasons.
 First, if college students donÅft have any money, they canÅft do anything: for example, buying books, playing with their friends, and having a date with a girlfriend. Especially, men not having money canÅft have a date, so I think men should do a part time job.
 Second, if college students want to work at a business in the future, it is good thing for them to enjoy good experience at a part time job. I think they had better know a rule of society. They will be able to prepare to join a society there.
 Third, college students will come to find money precious as they get money on their own. These days they donÅft notice how precious money is. They are inclined to think that they have a lot of money. So from this point of view, working is an important thing.
 People may think that college students should study learning. But I think it is more important for them to learn things like a rule of society without schoolwork. Even if they do well at school, people not knowing common things of society will be not able to enter society.
