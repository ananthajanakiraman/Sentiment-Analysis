In these days, prohibition of smoking is tightened more and more.
 But I donÅft think so much to smoke should be completely forbidden at
the all the restaurants in Japan.
 However, many reasons would be offered, I want to give an opinion that
cigarette is one of the most popular luxury item.
 I think luxury items important for people, not only, cigarette but tea,
coffee, and liquor. These items are not necessary for men, but they
could make you pleasant, and that is funnily important. A person who
knows the delight of enjoying luxury item seems to have a relaxed frame
of mind. I think that attitude is one of the important factors to
estimate a person. So smoking should be allowed at the restaurant, I think.
 Many people will criticize that opinion. For example, cigarette smoke,
especially side stream smoke is harmful for not only a smoker but also
people not smoke.
 But I think that problem will be solved easily. That is, dividing
smoking area and no smoking area more severely. If a guest smokes in no
smoking area, they warn him or take a more rigorous stand.
 We have a right enjoying luxuries freely, provided they are not crime.
