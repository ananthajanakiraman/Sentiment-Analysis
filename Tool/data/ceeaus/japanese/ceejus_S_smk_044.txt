I agree with a ban on smoking in Japanese restaurants. A lot of  
people dislike smell and smoke of cigarette. Some of them become  
unwell. They donÅft want to meet come across a smoker especially when  
they are eating. Account of smoking, a good taste of dishes goes bad.  
In restaurants, they canÅft change a place where they are seating.  
Since there are people who donÅft trying to think of surrounding  
customersÅf trouble, the restaurants themselves should say that we  
donÅft allow smoking to make a comfortable place for everyone. A non- 
smoking seat or smoking seat has no mean because there is no wall  
between them. If two seats are not divided, smoke will spread over  
the restaurants.
  Smoking also has a big problem in our health. It causes some kinds  
of cancers. It is well known that passive smoking does more harm than  
direct smoking. May smokers give a hazard to not only themselves but  
also others? None of people feels good by knowing that harmful  
substances are floating around. This matter ought to be considered.  
So the place gathering people like restaurants has to be made a rule  
about smoking, which is decided not for smokers but for non-smokers.
