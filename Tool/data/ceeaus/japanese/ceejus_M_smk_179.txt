I disagree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.

The law doesn't ban smoking now, so people should have had the freedom to smoke yet.

However, it is also true that smoking is harmful to people's health, and the harm for people around a smoking people is bigger than that for him. And there are people who dislike being with smoking people. So (many restaurants already do it,) all the restaurants should separate the section which smokers use and which nonsmokers use.

 

My father smokes (, my family dislike it), and there are many smokers at the university. So I'm used to being with smoking people.

I don't know that smoking is related to the cancer, but I'm sure that smoking does harm to my health. Cigarettes are like drugs, it is hard to stop using them. And the price of cigarettes became higher.

So I will never smoke in the future.
