I agree with the statement. Now, I work part-time, I think that a part-time job is important for college student. Because I think we can be brought up by part-time jobs. I will prove the reasons. There are some reasons. 
First, earning money for living by me is important. We may be noticed how important money is and we may appreciate my parents who work hard for family every day. So, I have saved of my money since I started a part-time job.
Second, though this may be big, I am studying society by a part-time job. For example, I am working at bar, the jobs are good. But sometimes those are very hard. When many guest come bar at the same time, workers become very busy. I used to be confused when I started working. But it is a year ago. I got cooking skill and patience. So I can get over small problems. 
Third, we can make new human relations. I made friends with many people. I often go to play with them. They become my best friends.
In this way, I have got through precious experience. But I worry about that I neglect studying as I belong to baseball club, I am busy for club activity. So I should do my best studying, club activity and a part-time job.
