I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Now I will show some reasons.
Firstly smoking does harm to people. So if you continue to smoke, it will be all the cost of your health. And even people who donÅft smoke are harmed by smoking. For example, smoking may cause lung cancer, respiratory diseases, arteriosclerosis, and so on. And there are many families at restaurants. Because smoking can harm to children, all the more smoking should be banned at restaurants.   
Secondly if you smoke at restaurants, people around you cannot eat foods deliciously. This is because smoke can damage taste of foods. For example, you cannot smoke at Starbucks at all. Starbucks take care of flavor of coffee. It is important to keep taste of foods and drink.
Finally smoking is banned at all the restaurants in some countries. For example, the US, the UK, Italy, Australia, Canada and so on. In these countries, if you smoked at restaurants, you are punished for smoking. And other countries are also going forward with banning smoking at restaurants. Like this, there is tendency which smoking should be banned at restaurants in the world. So Japan also should ban smoking at restaurants.
