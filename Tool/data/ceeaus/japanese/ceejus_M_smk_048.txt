Å@I disagree with this opinion for the following reasons.
    First, smokers cannot live well without smoking. If smoking is completely banned at the all restaurants in Japan, smokers who are in the restaurants donÅft enjoy dishes and chat with their friends well. They also start to want to smoke and get irritated because they are poisoned by nicotine. Unfortunately, nicotine influences human body very powerfully. So when they do so, you donÅft know what they will do. They may kick the table on which there are a lot of dishes simply because they are irritated. They may hardly criticize a waiter simply because he or she is not good about communicating with them. Smokers who are taken away from cigarettes are too dangerous.  
    Second, restaurantsÅf sales will fall down. According to research, about one fourth of Japanese people are smoker. It means that if smoking is completely banned at the all restaurants in Japan, restaurantsÅf sales will fall down to three fourth. This must influence restaurantsÅf management. When it is difficult to manage restaurants, a lot of employee will dismiss, and there will be a lot of Japanese people who donÅft have any occupations. It is bad for Japan, and Japanese people.
