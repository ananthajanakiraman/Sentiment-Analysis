I think it is necessary for us to prohibit from smoking in the
restaurant. In the restaurant we should enjoy having lunch and
conversation and so on. I think it is needless to smoke at this place.
Generally speaking, a smoke of tobacco causes lung cancer. I canÅft find
the advantage to smoke.    And to smoke in the public place such as a
restaurant also influences for nonsmoker. It is difficult to shut off
the smoke completely.Å@  For nonsmoker there is no such troublesome
thing like this. If we suffer from disease because of otherÅfs smoke, can
we allow that we are made to do so?  Of course I canÅft allow them.
Recently, people that smoke tobacco have been given a card. The card
called TASPO.
When we buy a tobacco, we have to show the card. I think this means
recognizing the danger of the smoke in the society. If tobacco doesnÅft
affect our health, the card is not invented.
Restaurant is used a lot of people. But there are not people who take a
trouble to smoke.
So there is no necessity to provide smokerÅfs room at the place of a meal.
ThatÅfs why I agree the statement prohibiting from smoking at the restaurant.
