 I oppose banning smoking completely at all the restaurants in Japan. Because there are some faults. I would like to write about them. 
     Firstly it ignores human rights of smokers. Smoking surely causes harm to people in surround. But smokers have right of smoking. It is no good that we one-sidedly force our opinions.
     Secondly managers of restaurants lose the revenue by ban the smoking. Because banning the smoking prevent guests of smoker go to the restaurant. So the number of guests decreases and the revenue also decreases.
     Thirdly restaurant is precisely the place where guest comfortably enjoys eating. For smokers it is necessary to smoking to have a good time. Therefore banning smoking is equal with disturbing smokersÅf right of enjoying.
     Finally banning smoking treats nonsmoker well and treats smokers coldly. This is a kind of discrimination. Even kids know that discrimination is bad. It pays attention to only nonsmokers.
     For such reason, I oppose banning smoking completely at all the restaurants in Japan. But I agree with placing some nonsmoking seats, because it reflects nonsmokersÅf rights. This way brings equality between smoker and nonsmoker. However, it is not probably best way. I would like to study deeply and find the better way.
