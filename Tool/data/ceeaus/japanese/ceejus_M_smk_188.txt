I agree with this opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I have three reasons. The first reason is passive smoking. The space of restaurants is very close. So if someone smokes in the space, the smoke spreads very rapidly. The smoke is very harm to not only smoking people but also non-smoking people. Therefore, the human who has trouble in the lung are not glad to go to restaurant. But, if this rule applies to Japan, everyone can be entertained in all the restaurants. The second reason is that bad smell remains around objects. If someone smokes on the seat for a long time, the seat has bad smells. So these objects spoil for a very short time. The third reason is that Japan fall behind from the view that non-smoking rules. The foreign countries that are similar to Japan in power are non- smoking in public space, because the world health organization issued the non-smoking in the public space. So many countries are not permitted to smoke in restaurant. I think Japan should become non-smoking country, otherwise the impression of smoke in Japan become worse in the future. It is true that this rule is hard to accept for smoking people, but we have the effort to improve the national health.
