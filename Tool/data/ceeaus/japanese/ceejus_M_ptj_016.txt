      A part−time job is loved by many people ,especially by university student.　Passing an entrance exam , I looked for　a part-time job .Since then I have done double work, and　　 sometimes  even depend on the job which need us to work one day alone. Now I`m looking for another job which is higher wage.

     The main  purpose of having part- time job is usually  to earn  a  lot of money to use freely ,buying cloth, eating  lunch  etc. But many students engage in a club activity.And many students need to spend a lot of　money there. I belongs to dance club in Kobe univ. In the club ,we obliged to take part in competition, and we have to spend too much money.for example ,fare ,entry fee,and the money to drink with all the member every time.the money,therefore , vanish from hand to hand at the moment.

      When  I was child , my mother and her friend said to me "ALL students have to do is studying hard ".Of course Ithink so too.  So  ,instead of me ,my parent pay school expences. I don`t have to earn the expences.  I am able to go to university to study a lot. But  I think now it is time to  be independent to some extent !  This is most important study for the university students. Through the part-timejob ,  for the purpose of  doing  or going on  what I want to do ,play ,club  activity,..etc, we have to work, sometimes involved in some trouble. At last, we can get money. 

     it is vital  for us to have part-time job. Having part time job is filled with the elements of society , and we can get someting to survive all by myself．
