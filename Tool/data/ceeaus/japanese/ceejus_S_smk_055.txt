These days, there are more and more places where smoking is banned. This is why many people have got interested in their health because of the progress in scientific research. For example, a scientific research tells us that passive smoking is much more harmful to our body than active smoking. In other words, it is possible for a smoker to make all the people around him ill, lung cancer! 

  Smoking should be banned at places which many people visit, such as stations, offices and restaurants. But it is not right to ban it completely.

  Some smokers think of smoking as an essential deed in their lives :they may think smoking is as important as breathing. If they cannot smoke at restaurant, they may feel unhappy, cannot have happy conversations and cannot take a good rest. It may cause many problems in their work. For instance, a white-collar worker canÅft suggest good ideas on their business and a blue-collar worker canÅft show their full abilities. We donÅft have the right to deprive them of freedom of taking a happy rest...

  For another reason, we must consider the loss of products of human culture. Tobacco which originally came from cigar is one of the greatest products of human culture. It has long long history. So, it is a pity that we lose it owning to the excessive bans on smoking.

 Of course, it is very important to think about the health of those who around smokers. Smoking may lead them to death. So, we must make systems which allow both smokers and non-smokers to enjoy a happy rest!
