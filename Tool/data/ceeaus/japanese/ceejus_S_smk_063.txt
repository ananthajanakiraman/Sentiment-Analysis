Today, some restaurants remove a seat of smoking section. I agree with this plan. A restaurant is a place for eating foods. In the restaurant which we can smoke, a person disliking the smoke has to endure it during a meal. It is only pain for him to eat such a place. If you weren't a smoker, you would feel unpleasantness in a smoky room when you're eating. Even if it established both a smoking section and a non-smoking section,Å@the smoke has spread all over the restaurants in the end. For another reason, itÅfs given a policy of Japanese government for the past several years. They have assumed a severe attitude toward Japanese smokers. So the smoking population of JapanÅ@have gradually decreased in the last 10 years, and it is said that the smoker of the current Japan is about 27,000,000. I think the restaurant also contributes to decrease Japanese smokers. In other countries, not to mention all the seats prohibition of smoking at the restaurant, it even becomes no smoking space. Smoking is not good for health. It causes some fatal disease. In addition, the smoke gives harm to not only the smoker but also others. I think that Japan learn such countries.
