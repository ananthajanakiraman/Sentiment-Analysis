I agree with this statement. Because, there is a variety of people in restaurant. For example, someone donÅft like cigarette smoke, someone may be a pregnant woman who have to avoid cigarette smoke, someone want to quit smoking, and so on. Some people like these surely feel uncomfortable, if they smell only a few cigarette smoke.

  Recently, restaurant floor is divided into the two sections, smoking section and non smoking section. But, from my viewpoint where I donÅft like a cigarette smoke, I want to prohibit smoking in all sections. But it is strict.

  And, smell of cigarette smoke becomes the interference which enjoy the smell of the dishes. I have heard before that cooks donÅft smoking in order to keep their palate normal. So palate is so sensitive. By smoking, our palate become abnormal, this is wasteful. I like eating delicious dishes, so this problem that smell of cigarette smoke becomes the interference which enjoy the smell of the dishes is very serious. 

   Anyway, smoking affects the health and feeling of those around the smoker. Of course affects the health of the smoker too. From these reason, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
