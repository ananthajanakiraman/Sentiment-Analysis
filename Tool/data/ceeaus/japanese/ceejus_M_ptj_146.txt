"I think that a part-time job is important to university students. The
reason why a part-time job is important is that we can experience
various things and learn our view of life through experience of working.
For example, I have a part-time job tutoring a high school student who
is my friendÅfs sister in mathematics and science. At first I thought it
easy to teach her their subject because I was good at mathematics and
science when I was a high school student. In addition, I was not serious
since my student is my friendÅfs sister. But I realized that I was wrong
to think it easy to teach her when I visited my friendÅfs home and taught
her. I did not realize that thinking is different from real teaching
until I taught her in practice. After I realized my mistakes, I learned
difficulty of teaching others and responsibility to work through this
experience. Other part-time job gives us valuable experience, too. That
is why I think that we take responsibility for our action as a number of
society through part-time jobs. And I think that studying is important
when we are university student, but I think that having a part-time job
may be important and valuable more than studying. So I want to go on
trying to have a part-time job."
