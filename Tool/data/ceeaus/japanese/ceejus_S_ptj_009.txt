 Is it important for university students to have a part-time job?
 I think it very important and have three reasons for that. First, university students simply donÅft have enough money for study, clothes and club activities and so on. I am a scholarship student, so IÅfm not given money by my parents. But still I want to buy new clothes and accessories, to take part in club activities, and I also want to go to Korea for study in a couple of years. ThatÅfs why I work hard in a fast food shop.
Second, I often think these days that I must be responsible for my action at working time. If I make a mistake to customers when selling products, I should say ÅgIÅfm sorryÅh as soon as I can because IÅfm a member of the shop stuffs. My rude action to customers may make the shop less popular. Moreover, I shouldnÅft be absent from job if I got cold because my absence makes other staffs busier. Thinking of them, I came to feel working is strict.
Third, I found it very difficult and hard to work and make money by having a part-time job. I have it four times a week. To tell the truth, I think it hard to work after school. However, I canÅft come to live in luxury. When I knew that, I found how much my parents work hard to raise me and my little brother and how important I thank my parents.
With these reasons, I think it important for university students raised by their parents to have a part-time job.
