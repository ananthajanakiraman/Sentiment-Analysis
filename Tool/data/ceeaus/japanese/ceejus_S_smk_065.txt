I think that they should put a ban on smoking all the restaurants in Japan

As a matter of course, restaurants are the place for enjoying their dishes.

To enjoy dishes means not only tasting their meals but also savoring their good smell.

It prevents them from savoring their dishes to smoke.

Moreover, smoking causes the adhesion of bad smell on their surrounding peopleÅfs clothes, and in addition, smoking makes them feel unpleasant.

WhatÅfs more, smoking, especially smoke from the cigarette causes them bad health.

According to some studies, smoke from the cigarette makes people have a higher risk of developing lung cancer and some heart diseases.

Though it is at their own risks for smokers to lose their health, non smokers also lose their health.

Some smokers say that they have the rights to smoke, and say that forbidding smokers to smoke deprive them of their rights of smoking.

However, they are able to smoke outside the restaurants, so they are not able to say that they are robbed of their rights of smoking.

Therefore, they should prohibit smokers from smoking at all restaurants in Japan in order not to interfere with their savoring their dishes and not to give a bad influence on surrounding people.
