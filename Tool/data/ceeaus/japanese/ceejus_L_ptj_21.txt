I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job because college students only study but also experiment a lot of situation. A part-time job has the things that I do not get in the college life. I talk about me. I have the part-time job in Book off. I learned a lot of things. For example, I learned that being said ÅgThank youÅh is more pleasant than I think. I learned importance of money and do not use little money than the time which I am a high school student in. I learned how to use correct Japanese languages and how to deal with a register. I communicated with all kinds of people and I increased the chances that I talked with old people in. I knew a lot of things and I increased friends. If I do not have part-time job, I do not learned a lot of things and increased the time which I do nothing. But, I think that it is bad to work part-time too much and not to study. I think that a working student should work part-time moderately. So, I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
