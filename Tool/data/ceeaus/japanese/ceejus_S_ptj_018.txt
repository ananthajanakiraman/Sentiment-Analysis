I think that the part time job is very important for college students. There are two reasons for my opinion.
 First, the experience of part time jobs helps them to learn the social custom or manner. If a college student work part time, he must have opportunities of meeting his employer, seniors, or customers. So, they naturally learn how to contact with people whose positions are higher his one. It is difficult to learn these things only in college because the relation between students contains little social responsibility. If they have no experience of part time job, they may take a lot of time to get accustomed to their new job. And they also are confused with the new relationship between an employer and an employee.
 Second, part time job teach us what it is like to earn the money. People work, and they are given their pay. This simple relation is the base of life, and having some knowledge about this is necessary for young people, who will support the future society. And this lesson will make them think about their own job, and future.
Nowadays, there are very a lot of people who make their living only with part time job, and this is fact that part time job produce some serious problems of modern society. But, even in this time, part time job give young generation very valuable experience and lesson to make a step forward the ÅgsocietyÅh.
