"I think that it is vary important for college students to have a part-time job.  One of the reason is that college students spare a lot of money to buy some clothes and to play with friends and to do what you want to do.  In particular, in the case of a student who lives alone, he also must pay bill of meal,electricity and so on.  College students have to get much money.
 Another reason is that the experience that you did a part-time job will be useful when you get an official job, and you can be used to doing a job and have a confidence about work. So, you will be able to work efficiently. In addition, if you have a part-time job, you have something to do with more and more people and you learn how to touch each other and you will make friends. Moreover with what you learn in a part-time job, you can live a college life. So you can have a good time than ever. Because in terms of part-time job, you can understand the difference between college and society, you can spend college life, considering you should learn something in order to play a good part in future.
