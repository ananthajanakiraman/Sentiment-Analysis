I agree with the idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  I have 3 reasons.
 First, we need more money than when we were in our high school.  In order to go to the college, some of us need to take trains with paying the high fare, and some of us need to lend apartment because their houses are too far.  And more, we have to pay much money to study in the college. 
 Second, we need to have experiences of working and earning.  After graduates, most of us will start working.  Then, if we have no experiences of working and earning, we have to start working without noticing the importance of working with having a responsibility.  Under this condition, the work must not be done well.  So we need to learn the importance of working with a responsibility earlier.
Finally, if we have a part-time job, we can become a more social person.  In the university, we have much time with people who are in the same generation.  No one is the same with others, but we sometimes tend to have a same thinking because of our similar environment.  When we work, we need to communicate with various people.  They may have a different idea from us, so we will try to consider what they want, what they need, or what they feel.  Then we can learn how to make a good human relationship.
For these reasons, I think that college students should have a part-time job.
