I don't agree to this statement. I don't like smoking, but this statement is 
too extreme.
 I have never smoked before, and perhaps I won't smoke in the future. Because 
smoking is bad for the health, and modern society is against smokers. As a mat
ter of fact, the people who try to stop smoking and have already stopped smoki
ng are increasing.
 However, the most reason why I don't like smoking is that I hate the flavor o
f smoke. It is simple reason. But when I breathe smoke, I cannot stop coughing
. 
 I mentioned disadvantage of smoking, but I don't think smoking should be comp
letely banned at all restaurant in Japan.  Most restaurants in Japan have smok
ing area and nonsmoking area. I think it is good system. I have never felt bad
 in Japanese restaurant because of smokers. It is impractical to ban smoking a
t all restaurants. I think smokers should not be limited still more. 
 Today, smoking is banned at many place in Japan, and more and more smoking ar
eas are disappearing. It is pleasure for the people who don't like smoking. I 
am also one of the people who think so. However, I think we have to consider s
mokers as well as nonsmokers. I hope smokers and nonsmokers are satisfied at r
estaurant.(213word)
