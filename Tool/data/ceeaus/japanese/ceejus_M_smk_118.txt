I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan because smoking is bad for the health. Smoking harms not only smoker's health but also another person's health. So the Japanese government is beginning to prohibit smoking. For example, school teachers are prohibited smoking inside an elementary school and a junior high school. When I was a junior high school student, school teachers are prohibited smoking not only inside buildings of school but also inside the others. In America, the state governments imposed a high tax on the cigarettes so that smokers try to give up smoking. As a result, the price of cigarettes rose and was more than 1,000 yen, but the policy was effective in giving up smoking. Therefore smoking is considered to be bad for the health in a lot of countries and many governments begin to adopt a policy to smoking. There is another reason why I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. In Japan, there are seats in the smoking section and nonsmoking seats in restaurants. But each seat doesn't completely be divided because we can't separate the air in seats in the smoking section from the air in nonsmoking seats. So people who sit a nonsmoking seat breathe in smoke of cigarette. Therefore I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
