  I think that should not always be banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  Instead of it, I want to divide the people the people for smoking or not smoking.  That is to say, the restaurants make some smoking places.   It is because that I hate smoke.  When I'm near smoking people, my lung is like seized and I feel so bad.  Furthermore not smoking people near smoking people will be also cancer like smoking people.  So not smoking people should not be near the others.  Now, there are many ones like so.  I feel it so good.  It is personal decision whether he smoke or not smoke.  So we shouldn't ban smoking, but smoking people cause harassment to the others.  We have many problems about smoking like walking with smoking, getting cigarette away on the street, our environment and so on.  Of course at restaurant, we think seriously about general way of smoking.
