There are many matter related to smoking. Smoking has a bad influence on conditions of other guests. People with smoker has more risks that they get sick, say, lang cancer, even if they have never smoked. 35~62 thousand people die due to passivity smoking in the world ( asahi newspaper November 24, 1999). Besides tobaccoÅfs smoke has bad smell. So other guests will lose our appetites if we take a smell of tobacco. This is big issue at restaurants. Because restaurants are the place that we eat foods. The smell of foods is as important as the taste of those. When we are eating foods, we enjoy the smell of foods. But tobaccoÅfs smoke prevent us from enjoying that. Perhaps, there may be those saying that smokers have the right that they can smoke freely at restaurants. But non-smokers also have the right that they are smoked passively. If smokers allowed to smoke freely at restaurants, the non-smokersÅf right is ignored. Furthermore, if smoking is banned at restaurants, restaurants donÅft need to buy smoking stands. Then restaurants can reduce the cost so they can offer better services in lower charge. So smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in japan.
