I am opposite to no smoking in all seats of the restaurant. 
Because the biggest reason is an individual freedom. 

As for the cigarette, only the point that harms the body tends to be closed
up. However, the cigarette was a tool that helped communications before.
Cigarette made people feel relax at the time of having a meal together.
Moreover, it is crazy to restrict only the cigarette, and not to restrict
liquor etc. they are harmful to the body in no small way. 

The restaurant camouflages the best-before date recently. 
The invisible harm is much more dangerous than the harm of the cigarette.
It is necessary to review it from the system of the restaurant before it
complains about the harm of the cigarette. 

Basically, there are a lot of restaurants and pubs in which people can
smoke. People who hate cigarette have to search for the restaurant and the
pub of no smoking, to search for the restaurant and the pub where the
smoking seat and the no-smoking zone are perfectly divided, or not to go to
the restaurant and the pub. The cigarette is luxury goods. Do not criticize
to person's hobby! 


Mark Twain said, ÅgQuitting smoking is easy, I have done it thousands of
times.
Åh
