I agree with the idea of banning smoking in the restaurant.  I have some reasons.
   Smoking is very harmful for us.  First, smoking people are more likely to have the lung cancer than non-smoking people.  The smoke of tobacco causes not only lung diseases, but also other diseases like heat and brain diseases.  Second, the smoke from tobacco also influences to people who are nearby a smoking person.  So even if we dose not smoke, we are always in the risk of a lot of diseases caused by the smoke when there is a smoking person near us.  And more, the tobacco smoke prevents children from growing well.  Restaurants are often visited by many people including families with children, so people should not smoke in the restaurant.
   Next is a very important reason.  Recently in Japan, many restaurants have started to divide the space into two parts; for smoking people area and for non-smoking people area.  But in many cases, the imperfect wall between two areas allows the smoke to go to the non-smoking area.  People in the non-smoking area feel very uncomfortable.  This is so bad situation.  So restaurants should make a perfect smoking room or should forbid people to smoke completely.  But if a perfect smoking room is made, it may cost a lot of money, so the best way is banning smoking in the restaurant.
   For those reasons, smoking in the restaurant should be totally banned.
