"I agree with this idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are two reasons for me to agree it.

First, college students need much money because we have to buy expensive text books, clothes, food, and so on. We cannot cover these expenses with only remittance from our parents. Moreover if we travel abroad, we will need much money. But it is not good to ask our parents to pay travelling expenses.

I have lived alone since this April, and I realize that I do not have enough money to enjoy myself. Recently, I swear not to buy sweets because they are very expensive, although I like sweets very much. Without money, I can buy nothing.  So we should have a part-time job to get money.

Second, we can learn a lot of thing from a part-time job. For example, we can learn human relationships in society and we can really realize how hard work is. We can develop as a person through a part-time job. 

Now, I work at a bread shop as a part-time clerk. And there, I could become acquaintance with various generations and I could learn manners in society and importance of responsibility. I think I could become mature person than before. 

From these points of view, I think that a part-time job is very important for college students.
