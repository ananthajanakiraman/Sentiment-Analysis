I agree with the statement.  I simply hate a smoking person. If he smoke
outside,I would permit him.however,in the restaurants we canÅft escape
from the smoke,and are going to be forced to do.It is uncomfortable to
eat a meal being troubled at harmful matters ,nicotine,and so on.We must
consider other people especially at the public places.Smoking should be
banned so that everyone in the restaurant can enjoy his or her meal
.Some restaurants
have places for smoking ,but they are not so useful because  smoke can
move freely according to the flow of air.Of cource,I might be too
nervous,but anyway ,when someone wants to smoke ,he should select a
place not to bother people around him andÅ@harm their health.
Though most of us know that smoking is harmful not only for the smoking
person,but also people around him,there are many people who canÅft stop
smoking.It is free to smoke however often and much.That is his business.
He has the right even to become sick,but does not have the right to make
people sick.
Every time I see smoking person ,I feel bad and wish there were noÅ@tabacco.
Now we have many information ,so we ought to use them effectively and be
more careful about our health.
