I disagree with this statement.
At present, people who are alive longer than 20 years are not forbidden smoking by the law in Japan. So they all have the right to enjoy smoking at will. And of course they also have the right of using the restaurants. If smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants, they cannot genuinely enjoy their own relaxed time - eating, drinking, chatting, and more. 
 Recently the risk of Åepassive smokingÅf has often come up as a topic that citizens have been interested in. It is surely the important problem for all of the people, especially they who do not smoke or dislike smoking may think about it seriously. But many restaurants already take the provision against this problem: setting up the smoking seat and the non-smoking seat. Setting up both of seats and choosing seat sitting, people either who smoke or do not smoke can spend comfortable time at a restaurant. This provision seems enough to enable all of them to enjoy eating. Banning smoking completely may be too hard for people who like smoking and deprive them of their pleasant.
 
 Smoking people should enjoy smoking with a manner toward other non-smoking people.
