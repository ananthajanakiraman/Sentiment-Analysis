I disagree with the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.

Today many people feel stressed.

They have to work from early in the morning to late at night and they have little time to feel relaxed.

Some of them may worry about human relations.

Smoking in their break time or after work is necessary for them to work vigorously.

Let me show you an example.

I work at an Italian restaurant.

In the evening about 40 percent of customers want to have smoking seats and they smoke while eating pastas.

As seeing them, I realize that nothing can make them happier than smoking after work.

And people who have non-smoking seats donÅft seem to mind cigarette smoke.

You may say that exposure to secondhand cigarette smoke could cause serious health problems, especially lung cancer.

In fact, there is a close connection between lung cancer and smoking.

So smoking seats must be separated from non-smoking seats in the restaurants.

And smoking people should keep in mind that people who do not smoke hate to be exposed to cigarette smoke.

But as long as they follow the rule, we donÅft have right to deprive them of their pastime.

So I am against a complete ban on smoking at all the restaurants in Japan.
