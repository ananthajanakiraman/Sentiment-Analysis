I think itÅfs not important for college students to do a part time job. Because, studentÅfs job is studying, I think. College students must study more hard. Studying is more important than part time jobs for college students.
It is often said college students need a lot of money. Actually students want a lot of money for play with their friends and so on, so they want to have part time jobs.
Some college students live alone, so they need pay the cost of living. They may need to work for living.
I have friends who have part time jobs. Some of them do both a part time job and study properly, but others do not so. The former is wonderful, but the latter is bad. A lot of students who have part time job tend to be the latter. They do part time jobs too hard, so they are very tired and sleepy in their class. If they are too tired to study, they should not have part time jobs. 
Studying in college is difficult, so students who want to work at any cost should work in long vacations and save money. Then they can do both part time jobs and studying, I think.
