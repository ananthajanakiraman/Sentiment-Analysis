In my opinion, smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. But I think that restaurants which many children use should completely ban smoking. That is because smoking may have bad effects on them. Smoking is bad to health and may be the reason to cause cancers. People whose ages are under 20 must not smoke. But they may want to smoke when they see people smoking in the restaurants. Today more and more people stop smoking. So smoking should be banned in the restaurants for them to be comfortable. But, there also many people who always want to smoke. If all the restaurants ban smoking, they will be angry and not be comfortable. So in my opinion, there should be the restaurants which people can freely smoke, and only adults can use the restaurants. There should be the restaurants of two types. One type completely bans smoking and the other type completely permits smoking. Today, the view of smoking is changing. According to the newspaper, the number of smokers is decreasing. So I think some changes are needed in the restaurants. It is best that all people who are both smokers and not smokers are comfortable. I believe that my opinion will make it possible.
