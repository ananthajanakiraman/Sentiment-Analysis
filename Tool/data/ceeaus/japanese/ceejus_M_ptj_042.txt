 I  agree  that  it  is  important  for  college  students  to  have  a  part-time  job.  Because  we  can  get  a  lot  of  techniques  and  knowledge  through  part-time job.  After  we  get  a  job,  they  sometimes  helpful  to  our  job.

 Now,  I  am  working  part-time  in  sushi  shop.  There, Owner usually  says  that  fine  greeting  and  smile  are  very  important.  We  must  think  most  about  guest.  Under  employment,  it  is  not  changed.

 Also,  recently  NEET  is  increasing.  I  do  not think  they  are  not  going  to  get  a  job,  but  they  have  anxiety  about  technique  and  knowledge  of  jobs.  They  once  have  a  part-time  job ,  the  anxiety  may  be  cleared.  Therefore  NEET  will  be  decreased.  Decreasing  NEET  is  good  for  future  of  Japan.  So ,  I  think  part-time job  is  good  for  college  students.

 In  fact,  through  working  as  part-time job,  I  am  developed.  For  example,  a  year  ago,  I   am  very  shy.  I  could  not  speak  stranger.  But  now  I  am  able  to  speak  stranger  ,of  course  guest.  Also  before  I  begin  part-time  job,  I  did  not  smile  very  much.  But  in  the  sushi  shop  I  forced  smile.  Now  my  smile  has  increased  in  my  daily  life.

  Last  reason  is  that  through  part-time  job,  we  can  meet  a lot  of  people.  He  or  she  may  be  best  friend  or  partner  of  our  life.  Talk  with  their,  we  can  get  new  knowledge.

  It  is  important  for  college  students  to  have  a  part-time  job  for  these  reason.
