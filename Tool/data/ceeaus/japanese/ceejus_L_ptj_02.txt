I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are three reasons I think so. By the way I have a part-time job. I wrote reasons which base on my experience of part-time job.
At first, I can have a experience of society by having a part-time job. When we do something, we have commitments. In part-time job, I feel it strongly. We canÅft get money easily. I did hare work and then I could get money. I can learn importance of money. We ,university student, can change part-time jobs so we can be a man who sale bread or clothes and then be a man who deliver news paper or pack or a man cook crape or okonomiyaki ,teacher of private school, a shop boy of first food or coffee shop and so onÅc If we were thirteen years old, could we change the jobs easily? I think the answer is no. Changing jobs is not easy for a businessman.
  Second reason is that we can meet many people at part-time job. I made friends with many people at part-time jobÅ@and some one go to different university, some one is different age, some one is from different part of Japan. If I didnÅft start part-time job, I would never meet some of them. Things talked by different university student or different age person are very interesting to me. I can know what I have never known.
  Third reason is that getting money refers to help my parents and we can get money to do what I want to do by getting money. I can buy books and clothes, bags.
  It follows from this three reasons that I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
