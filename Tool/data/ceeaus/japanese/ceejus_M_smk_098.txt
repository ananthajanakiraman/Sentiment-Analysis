I suggest that it is important not only in Japan but also in the world to ban customer from smoking at restaurants. Restaurants supply us with so very good food or drinks that we should taste them as they are. If we smoke, the taste and flavor of them will change to completely other things. That is too rudeness to cooks of restaurants. Restaurants also try to give all of guests very good time, but if someone smokes some guests who hate smoking feel uncomfortable. 

These days many people donÅft like a cigarette or its flavor at any place. Especially the smoke of cigarette brings our bodies bad influences. So I think that restaurants which allow customers to smoke will get smaller number of guests than restaurants which donÅft allow customers to smoke will. At the point of view of popularity, restaurants had better not recognize smoking inside. 

I talked about many reasons of agreement with the subject. If there still are those who want to smoke at restaurants, restaurants refuse them to enter or make the space to smoke outside restaurants. From many point smoking is out of order. In Europe warnings of a cigarette case say to us that smoking leads to death. Japanese expressions of a cigarette case should be hard and make people feel like not to smoke. LetÅfs discuss good ways, and make the atmosphere of restaurants very nice.
