I completely agree with the statement. I take it for granted that smoking is banned at all the restaurants. People who are nonsmokers have a right to avoid passive smoking and to enjoy dinner at the restaurants.

 What is more, I think smoking should be banned at all the public places in addition to all the restaurants. Before entering the university I lived in Chiyoda-ku where smoking is banned on all the roads. Everyone keeps the rule and the city is clean.  Since I was accustomed to the surrounding, when I entered the university and began to live in Kobe I was so surprised to see a lot of smokers on the roads in this city and I felt so unpleasant. I think there must be a lot of people who feel unpleasant about it. Though smokers insist that they have a right to smoke, I think it is so absurd of them to smoke at the public places without caring about othersÅf feeling and health. So I think it is natural that people who smoke at the public places should be fined heavily. If smokers stop smoking at the public places in order not to be finned, the public places become more comfortable and cleaner.             

 This is why I agree with the statement.
