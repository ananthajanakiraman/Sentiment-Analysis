"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. The reason is that we must not completely depend on our parents permanently and the time which we are college student is the chance to independence from our parents. There are a lot of college students who lives far away from their parents. They must do all things for themselves. If they don't have a part-time job they depend on their parents to have the money. That is burden for their parents and they are limited their movements when they are free. Certainly it is difficult to earn all money to live from the part time job but they can earn a part of money to live. I think that is the first step to independence from parents. 

Other reason is that if we have a part-time job it is advantage when we have a permanent-job. I think to work as part-time is a study and when we work in the near future the experience will help us. Furthermore if we work as part-time we meet a lot of people. That is also important for us.

In these reason, I think that to have a part-time job is important for college students.
