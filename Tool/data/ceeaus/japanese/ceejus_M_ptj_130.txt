"I think it is important for college students to have a part time job. We
have a lot of events in college life. For example club activity and
drinking party. So we must make money. Until we are high school
students, we get money by our parents. But college students are nearly
adult or truly adult. So we should have a part time job to make money by
ourselves. But then some people may say that college students should not
spend their time to do a part time job, they should spend the time to
study. I think that the idea is not wrong. It mai be best if we can do.
But it is very difficult to do such. In fact I have some friends who
don't have a part time job. They don't study hard and they get money to
enjoy various events by their parents. I don't like such a way very
much. I think that students who have a part time job can finish their
homework earlier than who don't have it do. The students who don't have
it may think that they have a lot of time,so they can do homework
anytime. Due to that, their start to do homework may be late. And I
think it is also important for us to experience a part time job. I think
study,club activity,part time jobs etc all things are a part of college
life."
