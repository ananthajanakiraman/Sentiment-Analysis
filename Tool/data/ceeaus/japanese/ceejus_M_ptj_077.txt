I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. 
Because it is useful for young people to work. I think there are two good 
points.

First, if young people have a part-time job, young people will be able to 
communicate with other people better than now. Recently, young people are 
said that they canÅft communicate with other people very well. This 
situation is bad. Because I think that it is essential for us to communicate 
with other people. So I think young people should practice to communicate 
with other people.

Second, if young people have a part-time job, young people understand that 
it is very hard to earn money. When young people know it, young people must 
stop wasting money. If young people give much money from their parents 
without having a part-time job, young people must waste money without 
thinking. In addition, young people will thank their parents. Their parents 
will feel happy. And young people will be independent from their parents. It 
is good for young people. Because young people will have to live by 
themselves in the future. If young people canÅft live by themselves, young 
people will be at a loss. It is a very bad.

I think young people should have a part-time job. Many experiences in a 
part-time job will help young people when young people start to live by 
themselves. A part-time job will teach us many things. So I think that it is 
important for college students to have a part-time job.   (257 words)
