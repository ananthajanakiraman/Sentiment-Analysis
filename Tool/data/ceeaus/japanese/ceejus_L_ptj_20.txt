Third, it is important for a part time job to learn human relations. For example, it is how to use respect words. We can be learned various things by others without relating age. College student is adult. A part time job is a place of experience. We should think how we should move in working and we would like to move more than now. If we become adult in society, we would like to use our experience. All of this I think college student should work various part time jobs.
