"I think it is important for college students to have apart-time job  
if it doesnÅft obstruct study.
  Firstly, what we learned or what we experienced practically will be  
surely useful. We can learn the manner and the courtesy in a  
workplace. This will be very benefit to the time when we work in an  
office in the future. In a workplace there are many things that are  
different from those we have ever known. So I feel it good to  
experience actually those things before we start to work.
  Secondly, I think we should do a variety of things during the  
student. If we graduate the college, we canÅft afford to do what  
we want to do. With such reason, only now there are times when it is  
possible to do favorite things and do many kinds of jobs. And an  
experience in part-time job might influence which jobs we choose in  
the future.
  Thirdly, we need to think of our parentsÅf burden. Our parents  
spend a lot of money on our education, so we ought to use money we  
earned by ourselves for our hobby such as a trip abroad. And we can  
know how we should manage money. In addition, it is said that it is  
not until we begin to earn that we know a value of money."
