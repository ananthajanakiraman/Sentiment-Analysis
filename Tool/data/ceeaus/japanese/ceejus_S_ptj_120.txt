I think it is important for collage students to have a part-time job.
I had three part-time jobs for a while.
One is in a yakiniku restaurant. The other is in a yamucha restaurant. Another one is a cram school teacher. I learned a lot of things at each other part-time jobs.

First, I learned the fun of working in yakiniku restaurant.
The restaurantkeeper taught me how to deal dishes to customers gently. And, I got many good friends there. We are good friends after I resigned there.
And, I got my voice loud because we  always say 「Irassyaimase!」 ,「Arigatougozaimasita!」to customers.  
Next, in yamucha  restaurant, I learned how to dish up. It was precious time and it was fun to me.  I always did’t make dinner in my house, but I got to make dinner after I learned how to dish up there.
Lastly, I learned it is difficult to teach to someone in the cram school. We teachers should think about how to teach to easy understand for each student. It sometime makes me confused but it made me maturity.
Like this, part-time jobs teaches us a lot of things for alive.
And, it is fun to buy something you want by paying money you got after you work.
We can learn sociality by having part-time jobs.
So, I think it is important for collage students to have a part time job.
