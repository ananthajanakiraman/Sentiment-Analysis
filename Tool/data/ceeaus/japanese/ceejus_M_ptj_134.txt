I think colleges students to have a part time job is
Important. Many students have a lot of time after school.
Maybe part time job is one of best thing to do after school same as club activity or playing with friends. If students saved the money with part time job, they could travel overseas in spring or summer breaks or bought what they want. And they know how to use money with plan per month.
Sometime in part time job happen accident which donÅft 
happen in school. To deal with that accident makes him 
good. In the future he happen accident again, he will not
confuse at that timing.
Part times job also can make friends are other school or company. I think it is good thing to make many friends in several spaces.  And I think itÅfs also good thing working with person who donÅft like. Because not every person fit me.
On the other hand some students absent his class with his part time job. Without saying itÅfs too bad thing.
Part time job is important but most important thing for students is studying. 
If forget that thing, part time job makes bad or vacant thing his college life.
