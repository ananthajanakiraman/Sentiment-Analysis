 I think it is important that college students have a part-time job. There are two reasons for this.
  One is that you can learn how to spend money. Although most of the college students have received pocket money from parents until they enter a college, it comes to be possible to earn it for oneself by having a part-time job. Through working part-time, you can realize that money is got not easily but by working hard. As a result, you come to save money and spend it carefully and premeditatedly.
  The other is that you can make friends with more people. In being the school which you belong to, you have little opportunity to get friends with the people who do not belong to the same school as you. However, by getting acquainted with the people who belong to other schools and promoting mutual friendship with them at the place where you have a part-time job, you can make your campus life more full.
  For two reasons mentioned above, I think college students should work park-time. And, I think part-time job is an indispensable part of the campus life and the college students who have not had it yet should start to have it at once.
