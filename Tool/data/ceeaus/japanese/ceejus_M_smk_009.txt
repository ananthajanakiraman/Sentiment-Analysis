I agree with this idea of ÅgSmoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in JapanÅh. There are three reasons I think. First,Å@tobaccos do harm to people by the smoke. There are many poisonous substances and very bad smell in the smoke. People who don't smoke feel ill and can't eat deliciously. Nonsmoking people eat at a restaurant for the same money that smoking people pay. But if they can't eat deliciously because of the smoke, it is not able to forgive. Second, though the restaurants have smoking area and nonsmoking area now, they are divided the one room so the division of smoking or nonsmoking doesn't mean. The two areas connect each other so the smoke can go through the area. I don't know why the restaurants permit it. Third, smoking at the table is bad manner. Around the table people must feel ill eating delicious dishes by the terrible smoke. And people who smoke tobacco are likely to be looked proud. Other people also feel that tobacco is bad thing.
Those three reasons make me agree with the idea of Ågsmoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in JapanÅh.
