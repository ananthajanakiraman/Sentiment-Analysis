I agree with this opinion.

Recently, places where people can smoke have been limited.

But, smoking is not banned at most restaurants.

Smoke bothers me when someone smokes near me at a restaurant.

Smoke smells too terrible for nonsmokers.

And smoke makes a meal worst, even if the meal taste very good.

I always think that smokers should put up with smoking while they are in a restaurant.

Perhaps most nonsmokers think so.

But, we Japanese people, especially in my case, cannot tell smokers to stop smoking though they feel unpleasant.

So, smoking must be absolutely banned at the all restaurants.

I wish I had my meal without worrying about smoke.

And smoke not only makes our meal worst, but also hurts our health.

It is secondhand smoke that we nonsmokers breathe in.

Secondhand smoke is more toxic than smoke which smokers directly breathe in.

And secondhand smoke is said to causes various diseases such as lung cancer.

I absolutely donÅft want to breathe in such a poison gas in any places as well as restaurants.

Smokers should care about nonsmokersÅf health.

And, some people may think that restaurants lost customers if smoking is banned at all the restaurants.

Certainly, some smokers may stop going to restaurants, but, perhaps, most smokers can stand smoking while they are in restaurants. 

And, population of nonsmokers is by far larger than that of smokers.

So, more and more nonsmokers must go to restaurants and customers increase.

Therefore, thatÅfs no problem if smoking is banned at all the restaurants.

So smoking should be banned at restaurants.
