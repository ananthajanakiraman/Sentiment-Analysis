I agree with the opinion that it is important for college students to do a part time job. There are some reasons. First, money is essential for our life. Second, we can experience the importance and difficulty of earning money by ourselves. Third, at some workplace we can make new human relationship with people in the same workplace. All the reasons are very useful for college students when they graduate from the university and get a job.
Some people may say it is not important for college students to do a part time job, because the most important thing for the college students is learning. Only thing college students have to do is studying hard. And to do a part time job so hard deprive college students of the time to study. 
But I donÅft think that learning is only thing the college students have to do. For example the other things the college students have to do are doing a part time job, club activity and so on. It is not good only to do a part time job. But almost all college students do a part time job with studying hard.
So I agree with the opinion that it is important for college students to do a part time job.
