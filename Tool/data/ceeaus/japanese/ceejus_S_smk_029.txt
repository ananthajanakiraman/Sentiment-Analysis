I donÅft agree with smoking at the restaurant in Japan.
There are three reasons why smoking should be forbidden at the restaurant.
First, after all smoking does harm to you.
Smoking causes you illness such as lung cancer.
So smoking should be banned.

Next the smoke also causes not only your health but also the environment.
The smoke pollutes air and cause various environmental disruption.
I think the smoke is out everywhere when you are smoking.
So I think Not smoking prevent the environment of the earth not only in the restaurant but also every where.

But Final reason is most important for my opinion.
I think smoking may annoy the other people in the restaurant.
This is because they directly breathe smoke that you are smoking.
The smoke gives bad influence to them.
For example, when you will start to eat dish in smoke that the other people are smoking, you will be uncomfortable to have dish because the smell of meal is spoiled and even the atmosphere of meal is spoiled.

So I think smoking should be forbidden at the restaurant so that everybody enjoys having meal.
And if possible, anyone doesnÅft smoke anywhere for people and the earth.
