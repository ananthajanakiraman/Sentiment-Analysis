I agree smoking to be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I am a non-smoker. IÅfll pick up three reasons to tell why I agree this problem.

First, it is the problem of health. Do you know this expression ÅgSmoking is worse than uselessÅh? It means that smoking doesnÅft have profits, but has much risk. Tobacco-smoke is thought productive of cancer. In the restaurants, there are many people who donÅft like smoking. You should not smoke because passive smoking is worse than active smoking. Smoking is bad for you and for others, too

Secondly, it is the problem of eating with smoke. In the restaurant, even if you finish eating then you smoke, it may be the time the other people start eating. There are many people who lose appetite because of the smell of smoke. As far as I am concerned, I donÅft like to have a meal with smelling smoke because I think smoke makes taste of meals bad. Even though I sat on no smoking seat, the smell of smoke blows to me.

Finally, it is a moral problem. Restaurant is a public place where people enjoy meals. Even if you like to smoke, it troubles the other people in the restaurant. You donÅft forget smoke makes hair and cloths smell bad. If you go to the public place, you should have responsibility not to trouble others.

I agree smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan because of these three reasons. The restaurants arenÅft the place to smoke. If you would like to smoke, you must go to non-public places or smoking lounges not to trouble the other people. I think it is the most important to understand there are many people having different opinions. Your favorite things may make others unpleasant.
