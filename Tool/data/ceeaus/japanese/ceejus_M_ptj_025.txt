I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. 
    There are a variety of part-time jobs. After graduating from college, college students work. So, by experiencing part-time jobs during campus life, they can prepare for work after graduating from college and know how work they are suited for. 
Also, by getting money as pay of work, they appreciate the value of money and difficulty with work.
In my case, I have a part-time job to teach junior high school students math. Through a part-time job, teaching someone something became one of my options of work in the future. And I appreciated the value of money and difficulty with work. The feeling I thanked for my parents working to grow me grew up. 
     I have another reason why I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Because I think college students should earn money to spend on their hobbies and play by having a part-time job.
I live with my parents. But I don't be given spending money and earn money for myself needed for play and baseball club activities I belong to.
      From these reasons, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
