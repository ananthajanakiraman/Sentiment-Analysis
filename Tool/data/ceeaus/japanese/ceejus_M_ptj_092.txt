I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. They should try to understand our society more and more. So they can know a part of this society to have a part-time job. Now I have a part-time job. I work at kaiten sushi in Osaka. I work there for half of year, but I could know many things. The things I knew are three subject. 

First, I could know importance of the money to stand on my own feet. Before than now, I have received money from my parents. In those days, I thought it is a little. So I always thought that I want to get much money. Now I work to get much money. So I can do many things. But I understand to get a lot of money is very very difficult!!

Second, I can communicate many kind of people. In my college, I am not able to communicate varies people, because the college students are similar. But in my workplace, there are many kind of peple. For example,the one man is high school student. And the one woman is musician. And the other man is the elderly.

Finally, part-time job is not real bussiness. So schoolwork and a part-time job are compatible with each other. College students must study the first. So a part-time job is the best work.
