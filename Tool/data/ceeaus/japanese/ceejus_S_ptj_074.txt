"I agree with the first statement.
Before entering collages, almost all of us entirely depend on our parents for not only money but also minds.
First point is our mind. We think our parents will help us if we are in trouble. But, when we are working part-time job, we have to think by ourselves, and decide what to do. Indeed our coworkers often help us, but sometimes we have some occasions to find our way out of the troubles. We can realize many important things through these experiences. For example, we will realize that we have to become independent step by step.
 Second is money. Our parents buy all things we need, and we tend to think it is natural that parents give us money, until we earn by ourselves. But if we start working part-time job, we can understand how difficult it is to earn money. We have to work hard in order to make enough money to buy what we want, even if its price is much lower than the amount of money which our parents give us. We will be able to thank our parents through this experience.
 However, we are college students. The most important our duty is study. We should not work so hard that we cannot study. We must remember this when we work.
