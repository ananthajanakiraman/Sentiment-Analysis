Recently, it has been gradually increasing of persons who hate smoke in Japan.
So, smokers are feeling kind of loneliness by opinions of people who dislike smoking.
It is true that smoking causes a lot of disease rather than non smoking person.
But smoke or not smoke is completely free and a right of every adult has.
Smoking should not be prohibited at all the restaurants.
Of course, non smoking personÅfs rights also have to be considered.
Restaurants can do many things to avoid smoke for the persons who donÅft smoke.
For example, I have seen a vacuum machine at a smoking allowed table of a restaurant a few years ago.
There was not smoke, and customers were enjoying eating both smoking and non smoking man.
On the one hand, to apart smoking space is good and easy action that almost all restaurants can do. Nowadays, not only to apart from smoking place, but also there are 
walls on the hedge of seats.
One important thing is to understand the other personÅfs mind. Smoking effects another
PersonÅfs health directly. So, when you smoke, just ask for a permittion to people who 
There is.
And non smoking person should consider smoking person.
