I agree with college student do a part time job. Because I think that it will be good for student. Moreover it is need for students who donÅft have enough money to go to college. And for most students need money. Because we need money for club and play. And I think that doing a part time job is good for students for their future. For example we can experience many things. And I think in college doing only study is not good for students. Indeed study is important for students to graduate school and work in the future. But study is not all for students. We can experience new thing that we cant experience for study. Bud we should not forget that it is important for students to keep our balance. It is not good for you to do a part time job too hard. Because do a part time job too hard may cause me cant graduate school. And I think that it is important to choose a part time job. Because if it were not suit me, it is useless for me. So we need to choose a part time job seriously. Therefore my opinion is part time job is important for students but it is need to care.
