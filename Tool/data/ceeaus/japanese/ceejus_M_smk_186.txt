I agree with that opinion. Because not only I hate smoking, but also the
smoke damages lungs and it maybe cause cancer. Someone may say that they
should separate smoking area and non-smoking area. It looks like the
best idea for smoker and non-smoker, but I donÅft think so. To make
non-smoking area in smoking area, some special machines or equipments
are needed. Generally it costs a large amount of money. (As long as the
owner seriously want to make non-smoking area.) It is true that the
smell smoke might not reach the non-smoking area by those items, but we
should know that all smokes spreads anywhere and all harmful smokes are
not smell. Some research says that nicotine, one of the most harmful
smoke in tobacco, doesnÅft smell and is invisible. So some invisible and
non-smell smoke may invade non-smoking area so that there is no rule
without the exception. By contrast, to ban smoking area and fill with
non-smoking area, no special machine or equipment is needed. There only
haves to be even a notice of no smoking. They only have to make a notice
of no smoking. It costs quite few money. (Whether the owner seriously
want to do so or not.)
