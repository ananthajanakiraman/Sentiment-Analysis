I donÅft agree the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in Japan. Surely, nonsmokers have rights that they avoid breathing cigarette smoke. It is because that nonsmokers damage their health by passive smoking. However, most restaurants have divided into the no smoking seat and the smoking seat. So, nonsmokers should sit the no smoking seat, and some restaurants have the functions except meal. For example, Ågfamily restaurantÅh have function of chatting, rendezvous, resource, studying and etc. Such time, the cigarette is indispensable for smokers. Therefore, I think that the smoking seat is necessary in some restaurants. However, I think that many restaurants could not be done separation of smoking areas. For example, the cigarette smoke flows to us even if we sit on the no smoking seat. This example is an imperfect separation of smoking areas. So, I donÅft agree the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant, but I think that it should improve the method of the separation of smoking areas. For example, the structure of the restaurant should be designed to take cigarette smoke into account. The area in the smoking seat is divided with the wall. Finally, this is an opinion from the smoker.
