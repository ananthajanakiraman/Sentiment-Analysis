These days, smoking has been prohibited at a bunch of public places, such as schools, stations and even some major streets in Kyoto.  That kind of trends is getting more and more popular among Japanese people, especially among those who donÅft smoke.  They will think restaurants, of course, are not exceptions, which I do not agree.  The main purpose of the restriction is to keep non-smokers from bad-smelling and harmful smoke of the cigarettes.  Therefore, as long as smokers and non-smokers are completely separated, it doesnÅft necessary to ban smoking completely.  Non-smokers might insist that they have rights to avoid disgusting smoke, but smokers also have the rights to smoke: smoking itself is not a violation of the law at all.  Some of them might smoke in order to feel relaxed and refreshed, and others might do to forget bad things.  In addition, cigarettes contain the chemical material called nicotine, which have a little addiction.  Some of the smokers have a serious difficulty in giving up smoking for this reason.  
 All things considered, we should not make smokers give up smoking at all the restaurants in Japan.  Prohibition of the law is too harsh on them.  We have much better choice; to make smoking areas in all of the restaurants.  By the designated areas, smokers and non-smokers can be completely separated.  This must be the solution whish both of them can be satisfied.
