Nowadays, every restaurant has smoking seats and nonsmoking seats in Japan. However, even when we sit on a nonsmoking seat, there is often the smell of tobacco from smoking seats. The smell makes people who dislike tobacco feel bad and they lost appetites. It seems that the freedom of smoking of a smoker should be accepted to some extent. However, restaurants are not where people enjoy smoking, but where people enjoy eating delicious dishes. Restaurants should be kept as the place where all people can enjoy dishes. Therefore smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants.
Smoking doesnÅft only make people feel bad with its smell, but also has a bad influence on others' health. They say that the smoke that a nonsmoker near a smoker absorbs has more harmful substances than that the smoker absorbs. Passive smoking is very bad for our body. Therefore, when you think about smoking, you will notice that where smoking is banned is increasing in Japan. For instance, we cannot smoke in trains, movie theaters or class rooms in the university. Therefore it is natural that smoking is banned at restaurants.
Smoking is worse than useless. In Japan, these days, it is also difficult to buy tobacco because the price is becoming higher and higher, and the system of ÅgTaspoÅh has been enforced. I hope that the number of smokers decrease with such reasons. When restaurants become the place where smoking is banned, it will help decreasing the number further more.
