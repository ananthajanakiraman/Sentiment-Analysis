There are a lot of smokers in Japan. Businessmen smoke on almost
every road and vending machines of tobacco are all around. Most of
trash on street is used tobacco. Manners and health of smokers are
more and more discussed these days. That results in restriction of
smoking at many places. Though some people insist smoking should be
banned at restaurants as well, should we ban smoking completely at all
the restaurants in Japan?
 A restaurant is a place where we have a meal. The cook makes dishes
proudly and serves them to guests. When they smoke, they cannot taste
the dishes. It means they spoil the dishes. This is why smoking at the
restaurant is no recommendation.
 Moreover, other guests are also in the restaurant. They enjoy eating,
chatting with their friends or with their family. If their neighbor
guest begins smoking, they stop eating or talking and have a glance at
him. Joyful time suddenly turns into painful time. They are robbed of
the right to enjoy the time at the restaurant. They have no way to
avoid it.
 For all these reasons, smoking should be completely banned at all the
restaurants. Smoking at the restaurant offends feelings and rights of
other people.
