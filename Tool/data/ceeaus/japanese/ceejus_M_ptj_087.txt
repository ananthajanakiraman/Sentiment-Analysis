  I agree with the opinion. Some students live by themselves, and others
live with their family. The former get money from their parents, but it
is limited. Sometimes they may have a trouble about housekeeping money.
So they need or want to get more money, and as a result, they have
part-time job. On the other hand, even if the latter have no money, they
can get it from their parents immediately. For that reason, some people
disagree with the opinion. But I think doing part-time job not only can
get money, but also has another good aspect.
  College students are ÅgstudentÅh and also like Åga member of societyÅh.
They study to take a job in the college and prepare to be a member of
society in a daily life. For that purpose, the part-time job is a good
place. We can learn many things from colleague or boss, for example,
etiquette, behavior, common sense, communication with other people and
what is working, and so on. They are very important for us to live in a
society. We canÅft learn them in the college or the home. Above all, we
can taste the pleasure of working, get money by ourselves and using it
for us. But donÅft forget that the main purpose of college students is
study. If we do part-time job extremely and our grades fall, it is nonsense.
