I agree with this opinion.
This is because I have three reasons.
First, we can learn how to communicate with others. When we do a part time job, we see parsons who already work and various customers. They are various ages and have different backgrounds. We often see people of the almost same age at college, but we cannot see such people of various ages. We must make relations in that situation. Fortunately, we may be able to have patience through communications with customers.
 Second, we can know the importance of money. We get money by our own work. This money is not given by our father or mother. We can know how hard we earn money. If we donÅft experience a part time job, we cannot know this really.
 Third, we can learn how to use words. When we see a person, we have to choose words.
For example, if the person is customer, we have to talk politely.
 We can touch the real society a little when we do a part time job. Our world will spread. This new experiences which we have not ever experienced will stimulate us and we will develop. So, I agree with this opinion.
