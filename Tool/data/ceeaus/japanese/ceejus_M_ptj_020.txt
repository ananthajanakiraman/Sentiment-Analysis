  I think that it isnÅft important for college students to have a part time job. There are some reasons. First, college students must save time for studying. The time for studying is not only time for college study but also time for getting qualifications. Those days, it is very important for us to get qualifications in college. It is because that having qualifications is advantage to do everything in our future. And, to get qualifications is so hard. In my case, I must study for 9 hours in one day to get accountant qualification. Second, we must work after graduating college. So we should prepare something for the time. For example, getting qualifications, strength, and so on. Thirdly, part time jobÅfs skills are useless in many cases in our future. For example, for many people, cashiers skills are useless in their future. These are my reasons why it isnÅft important for college students to have a part-time job. It is sure that we can get something if we have a part-time job. But, it is more important for us to prepare for our future. So I disagree that college students have a part time job. We should study hard in college and in double school.
