"I agree this statement. This is because an experiment to have a
part-time job will be useful when you work in the society. For example,
if you have a lot of kind of part-time jobs, the experiment will enable
you to talk about a lot of kind of subjects and you will become a
popular person. If you have a part-time job at a convenience store, you
will meet many kind of people, for instance the old, a woman who have
children, a high school student and of coarse other college student.
Then you will be able not to be afraid of talking with any kind of
people. If you have a part-time job at the place where is the same kind
as the place where you want to work, you will be able to know the job
which you want to do. These experiments will improve your talent and you
will grow up as human. Then you will get a weapon which you can use  in
the society. People who do not have a part-time job cannot get it. This
difference is very big. So I think that it is important for college
students to have a part-time job."
