I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. 
There are two reasons why I agree with the ban on smoking.
First, for non-smokers, passive smoking is very trouble issue. In restaurants, to avoid the passive smoking, there are two kinds of sheets, for non-smokers and smokers. But that is not so effective. This is because when we eat, we sometimes smell smoke. Then, we feel delicious meal becomes not delicious one. Families or students go restaurants   to enjoy having lunch, but they canÅft enjoy. If smokers canÅft stop smoking while they eating, there are no way without banning.
Second, lung cancer is very terrible illness. By taking much smoke into our bodies, we will come to have lung cancer. Now, many people smoke. So, most of them are likely to have lung cancer. Unfortunately, non-smokers also come to be lung cancer by taking smoke which smokers supply. We can avoid the smoke outdoor, but, it is impossible to avoid indoor. I think smokers should be worried about non-smokers. It is serious because this problem is related with our life. Banning smoking at all the restaurants may be able to decrease the number of people having lung cancer. 
This is why I think all the restaurants should be completely forbid smoking.
