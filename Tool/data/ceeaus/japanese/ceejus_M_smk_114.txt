Å@I agree with this statement because I think smoking isnÅft good for us at
all.
First of all I donÅft like smoke of cigarette. If someone sitting near me
smokes cigarette in restaurant, I want to change the table where smokes
donÅft come. Smokes of cigarette make me feel my dishes taste worse. There
are a lot of people like me in the world. We go to restaurant not to eat bad
dinner but delicious dishes. Smokes of cigarette are enemy of a good dinner.

  Then, smokes of cigarette do harm our body. For instance, smoke of
cigarette damage lungs. Heavy smoker is likely to get lung cancer. They also
damage our heart, stomach, a blood vessel and so on. Smoking is no less
harmful than poison is. Smoking is not only bad for people who smoke but
also for nonsmoker around them. The influence on people around smoker is
worse than that on smokers. This is a funny story.
  Moreover, we canÅft quit a habit of smoking easily. Cigarette makes us
feel like smoking more. Even if we decide to stop the habit of smoking,
eventually we smoke cigarette again. There are a lot of people who canÅft
stop habit of smoking.  Once we smoke, we continue to smoke forever.
  For those reason, I want to ask all restaurant to ban smoking.
