I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan, too. At a restaurant if when people who dislike mystify or smell of tobacco come, people around them begin to smoke, they probably feel unpleasant. This spoils their hope to eat delicious dish. And people who donÅft feel unpleasant even if someone is smoking near them when they are eating are few. Rather usually most of people hate it.

 As many people know, indeed mystify of tobacco influence people who smoke than people who influenced by second smoking. This is very troublesome problem for people who care a lot about their health and keep off alcoholsÅCtobaccos and so on. 

 There is a people smoke tobacco more than one case a day that is what is called heavy smoker. Recently smoke ward and city forbid people to walk in the town when they are smoking by ordinance. And so in addition to this if all restaurants forbid people to smoke, smokers may be sorry. But it is clear that to smoke tobacco is not good for smokers and people around smokers, too. And by this chance, I hope smokers will decrease the number of tobacco they smoke a day, keep off smoking at the table and think about their health.
