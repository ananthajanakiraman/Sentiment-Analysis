I agree with the college students having a part-time job. Because they can do various experiences that they cannot do at the university. 
First, they can know happiness of work. When they said by the guestsÅethank youÅf, they are sure to feel happy. Then their will to work is increased.
Secondly, Work is "a place of learning". They must learn many things to perform a job. But they can acquire many skills trough the job. (For example, if you teach high school students, you can get the ability of teaching simply.) That is to say, they can acquire skills while getting money. 
     Finally they can fill a gap between reality and ideal. We tend to estimate working lowly. However, when they work actually, they notice that working is harder than they have expected. Although they may be disappointed then, I think they approach to an adult by one step through such experience.
     For such a reason, I agree with the college students having a part-time job. But, I also think that it is bad to spend too much time in a part-time job. Their main job is learning. So they should have part-time job as long as it does not disturb the learning.
