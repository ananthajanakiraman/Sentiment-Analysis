I agree with this idea. Because college student need money for something such as buying text book and clothes, going somewhere, meal, and so on. 
Especially I think people belong to any club need some money. For example, I belong to light music circle and form a band. Of course we need to practice but we canÅft if we rent studio. We also need to buy instruments for instance guitars. So I need money and I have to have part-time-job. (I work at cram school and earn money now.)
I also think part-time jobs are not only way of getting money but getting some good
experience. I worked some kind of jobs for instance, move worker, making frozen pizzas, 
distributing tissues etc until now. I could know troubles someone who does it from them.Å@So I agree with this idea in this point.Å@
But I also think having too many part-time jobs is bad for us. In our life of college,
We have something which we can do then. But if we work everyday, we canÅft do them. So I agree with having part-time jobs but donÅft think we work too hard.
This is my opinion. Thank you.
