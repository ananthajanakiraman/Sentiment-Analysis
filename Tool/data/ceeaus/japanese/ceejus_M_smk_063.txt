I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
First, if people eat or drink with smoking, they will feel foods and
drinks less delicious than they have a meal without smoking.
Second, it is very important reason, smoking gives people so bad effect.
 Smoking is the major cause of the lung cancer.  The effect reaches to
not only the man who smokes practically but also people who are around
the smoker.  To make matters worse, the effect which passive smokers
were given is larger than it which active smokers were given.  So stop
smoking is healthful for both smoker and people who are around the smoker.
I am really afraid of the disease by smoking.  Of course I will never
smoke in my lifetime, but I cannot stop other peopleÅfs smoking.
The other day, I went to a nearby restaurant with my family.  We sat on
no smoking seats.  But then I noticed the smell of smoke.  It is because
the smoke flowed from smoking area to no smoking area.  Smoking areaÅfs
air and no smoking areaÅfs air were not completely separated!!
Thus, if smoking area and no smoking area are separated by the words, it
is difficult to separate the air completely.
So for the sake of everyoneÅfs nice meals and health, smoking should be
completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
