We have got to know about harms of smoking recently, because many media 
report it.
According to them, there are various harms.
For example, smoking is incriminated as the major cause of lung cancer.
Another example, when the woman during pregnancy smokes, the embryo 
receives a bad manner.
And, in addition, smoking decreases in moving ability and the skin 
grows old.
Smoking after one agrees to these harms is individual freedom and we 
donÅft have any right to get them to quit smoking.
But in places that an unspecified number of people gather in such as 
restaurant, it is necessary to prohibit smoking.
Because, as we have already know, those who breathe the smoke that 
rises up from the top of cigarette suffer more serious
harm than those who smoke actually.It is what is called passive smoking.
If people smoke and injure their health, they have no one but 
themselves to blame,
but it is ridiculous of people who donÅft actually to receive the harms.

And restaurant is the place to enjoy dishes. So it is problem that the 
good smell of dishes which chefs made
with their whole heart is deaden by the smoke of cigarette.
It is bad manner to chefs and dishes.
In brief, by prohibiting smoking, more people are able to have a good 
time in restaurant.
This is why smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants.
