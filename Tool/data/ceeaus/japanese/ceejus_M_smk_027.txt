I agree with the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Tobacco damages the health of people who smoke and donÅft smoke. When there are people who smoke in the same room, people who donÅft smoke feel bad and cough. People who smoke will feel so comfortable when they smoke. But tobacco trouble people who donÅft smoke and they feel so bad.
 Restaurants and coffee shops are areas where we take a rest. So, people who donÅft smoke visit there in order to take a rest. But there are people who are smoking in a same room, people who donÅft smoke canÅft feel comfortable.
 I think that people who want to smoke should smoke outside and in the areas which are allowed to smoke. I think that it is a minimum manner.
 Tobacco gives not only harm to peopleÅfs health, but also bad smell caused by smoke. Because of the bad smell, most people who donÅft smoke feel bad. And the bad smell remains for a long time. The bad smell cling to our hairs, clothes, and bodies. 
 So, I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants and coffee shops in Japan.
