I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. 
I hate smell and smoke of tobacco. I think almost people who donÅft smoke feel it too. So there will be many problems about smoking in the restaurants. First, smoke dirty wallpaper, curtain, and so on in the restaurants. Second, there are possibilities to occur a fire, and children may get burned by their tobacco. Third, because there are people who hate smoking, the restaurants have to separate smoking seats and nonsmoking seats. But because the number of smoking people is smaller than that of people who donÅft smoke, people who donÅft smoke can sit down on the smoking seats. It is unfavorable situation.  
   The other reason why I think so is that smoking is bad for the health. For example, smoking lead to cancer. It affects not only themselves, but also people who are around them. 
   I think that it may be impossible to ban smoking at all place in Japan. But the restaurants are the eating place. The smell of tobacco ruins the smell of dishes. And if all the restaurants ban smoking, perhaps the number of smoker in Japan may decrease.
   I wish everyone all over the world stops smoking.
