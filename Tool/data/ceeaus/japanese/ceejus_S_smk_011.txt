I agree with this idea that smoking should be completely banned at the entire restaurant in Japan. I have three reasons.
    Firstly, this is because that smoke is too bad for all the people. According to the survey, breathing smoke indirectly is worse for health smoking directly. Breathing smoke of tobacco causes lung cancer.
    Secondly, this is because most of people who donÅft smoke hate smoke. It is fool thing that people who donÅft smoke suffer from lung cancer because of breathing smoke indirectly, so they hate smoke. I suggest one example. When you eat dinner with your boss in the restaurant and he is smoking, if you hate smoke, can you ask him not to smoke? When youÅfre in this situation, I think the restaurant that bans from smoking is convenient. Optionally, employees who hate smoke are easy to come to work.
    Thirdly, it takes expense very much to install a fan that take in the smoke of tobacco in each table. If smoking is banned, the fan is needless.
    In conclusion, because of these reason I agree that this idea. If I say a desire, smoking should be completely banned not only at the restaurant but also at the other place we visit.
