‚h agree with an opinion that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are two reasons for that.
Firstly, college student need more money at some situation than junior school student. For example, we need money for a membership of something club, going to drink, shopping, and so on. But college students are almost same as members of society. So we should not depend on our parents but pay money that we earned by ourselves.
Secondly, we can have a lot of experience through a part-time job. For example, when I was a freshman, I taught mathematics to junior high school student at cram school. I thought that it was difficult to teach anything. I worked at a bar too. I thought it was hard for shy man to meet or talk. But these experiences will help me in future.
Most people think that not having a part-time job but studying is more important. I think that the idea is good too. To Study for getting some qualification will help us. But having a part-time job will help us as much as studying. That might be unimportant but useful in something. So ‚h agree with an opinion that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
