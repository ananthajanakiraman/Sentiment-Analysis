I agree with the statement. There are some reasons. For the first reason, college students need money to enjoy their campus life. They want to play with friends, buy their favorite clothes, and take part in parties. Some people who live alone near the college need also a lot of money to live. To do such things, they need money. Before entering the college, most students were given money by their parents, but some day they must be independent from their parents. So, they must know the difficulty of getting money. Of course, students canÅft make all money for their life, but I think that they have to get at least enough money to satisfy their desire and help their parents. For the second, they can meet many people to have a part-time job and get different knowledge which they couldnÅft get ever. There are many kinds of part-time jobs, and there are various people at the working place. Some are from very far place, and others are very older or younger than them. As working with such people, they can learn many things. And the experience of part-time jobs may be useful for them after entering society. For these reasons, I think that college students need to have a part-time job.
