I think smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I think that when the people who smoke exist in the situation which the people who smoke is not able to smoke in, the people who smoke doesnÅft feel good and comfortably eat dinner. But, I think that smoking causes all kinds of bad situations. For example, I think that if there are the people who smoke, the people donÅft know the taste of the cooks and eat. I think that smoke may extend to all areas in restaurants and the people who donÅft smoke may feel bad. So, I think that the people in the restaurant firstly construct the space in which there are the people who donÅft smoke and the space in which there are the people who smoke. Secondly, the people in the restaurant construct a wall between the two spaces. So, the people in the restaurant are able to deal with all kinds of people and the people in the restaurant solve all kinds of bad situations. Therefore, even if smoking is not banned at all the restaurants in Japan, the people who smoke and another people comfortably eat dinner in a restaurant. As a result, I think smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
