I oppose the idea that smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Restaurants should be relaxant place for all people. So if all the restaurants ban from smoking at their place, a lot of smoking people lose a lot of relaxant places and all the restaurants. Smokers are better being given the place at restaurants. But then some people think that what should people who donÅft smoke or who donÅft want to be with smoking people at the restaurant do? I think that this problem is solved by establishing smoking room and nonsmoking room. In fact I donÅft smoke and I have not felt discomfort at restaurants if there were nonsmoking room there. So I think that smoking is not needed to be banned at all the restaurants. But I think that individual restaurant may prohibit smoking at own restaurant. The reason of that, each restaurant has various environments. For example a restaurant has very expensive curtain, furniture etc, and more. And the restaurant doesnÅft want those to be stain by smoking. In such a case, I think that the restaurant may prohibit smoking. But smoking should not be   completely banned at all the restaurants by politics of a nation, a countryÅCor a city.
