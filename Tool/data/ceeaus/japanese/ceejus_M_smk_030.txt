I certainly agree to the idea of ÅgSmoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.Åh It is because it has now been a worldwide approach of increasing and spreading non-smoking areas.
     First of all, just like many other western countries are concerned of, Japan is also increasing non-smoking areas throughout Japan. Public buildings had first taken its action in various governmental offices and into social facilities. And now it has gradually but surely spread into private facilities like theaters, big and small shops, restaurants and companies. It seems that people had finally become to think about the non-smokers. It has even been taken into transportations like buses, taxis, trains and planes.
     Secondly, we have to be aware that restaurants are the most sociable places where various people get together. Their customers consist of children to elderly adults. Therefore, it is obvious that smoking is not good for them. Moreover we also have to be aware that people eat at the restaurants. Smoking would certainly destroy the flavor of food and drinks.
     Finally, I would have to say that smoking is not good for oneÅfs health. Cigarette smoke is now considered to be harmful to non-smokers as well as smokers. Therefore, to think of others, it is fair enough for smokers to smoke in smoking permitted places. As a result, more and more non-smokers want a smoke-free environment. And in the future, as I feel a little sorry for the smokers, but they would soon have an even harder time finding places to smoke.
