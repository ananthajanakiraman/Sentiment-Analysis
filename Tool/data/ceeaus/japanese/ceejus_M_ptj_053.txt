I agree this statement.

Someone may say ÅgDoing a part-time job is worthless. Even if you do it, you can get only money. You should use your time for study or hobby.Åh
But, I think we, university students, should have experiences about working. Certainly, studying and doing hobbies are worthy. However, working is more meaningful, I think.

While you work, you will make a lot of mistake. You will be scolded by your superior. You will try hard to understand how teach for this boy, how cook this meal, and to recover your superiorÅfs trust. If you only study, you canÅft have these various experiences. That is very pity.

These experiences exist only in business life. In universities, you pass your student life, take a class, write a report and play tennis with your circle mates.
I think there is big difference between business life and student life. 
In business life, money is very important. People in business always worry about how escape losing money or how get money effectively. There is a kind of interest relationship. But, in student life, you are almost freedom. There is no difficult relationship.
Of course you can choose Ågstudent lifeÅh ways, and ignore Ågbusiness life.Åh But, after graduating your university, you must live a business life. So, you should experience business lifeÅfs rules beforehand. 

These are reasons why I insist that university students should have a part-time job.
