I think also that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. In this essay, I want to speak about this topic why I am agreeable from two viewpoints.

At first, I decide to talk opinion from the situation as the restaurant user. As we know, the cigarette is very bad to a body even if I am passive even if active. In a restaurant, there are various people from a baby to the elderly. In the bar where only an adult is the cigarette matches alcohol, however in the restaurant where such a weak people is the  cigarette becomes only the harm for a child. And subjectively, I feel the meal badly when I eat with smoke. (But I think the coffee seems to match a cigarette.)

 Next, I will speak it from the situation of the employee of a restaurant. In fact, I work at an Italian restaurant. A main reason why such I agree is that a person who doesnÅft smoke canÅft sit in the seat so that there are smoking seats. Recently the number of smokers decreases. But the number of smoking seats does not decrease. As a result, a waiting room overflows with a person waiting for a non-smoker seat. If a smoking seat disappears, the turn of the shop improves and the profit of the shop increases. In addition, there is the reason that it is troublesome for me to prepare an ashtray.

 Due to these, I agree to this opinion.
