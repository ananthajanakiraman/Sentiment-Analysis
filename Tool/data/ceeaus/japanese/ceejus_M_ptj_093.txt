I agree this topic. I have three reasons for this opinion.
First I think that part-time jobs are studying of society. College students will become members of society. We have to accustom to working. It is important to experience for work. If we college students have got a part-time job once, I think when we get a job, it is easy to work. 
    Second we learn the community of society. If we donÅft get a part-time job, we have only the community of school. I think that we college students have to have several of communities, and we improve our sense of value. Then we will do well when we are employed. 
    Finally we college students have to start to independence from our parents. Because by get a part-time job we earn some money. In the money point we remove our parents from responsibility. We need some money for playing eating and so on. We have to thank for parents, so it is good to earn some money by our own. We also can independence from parents in the side of mind. I think we are able to grow up by working. 
     Therefore I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
