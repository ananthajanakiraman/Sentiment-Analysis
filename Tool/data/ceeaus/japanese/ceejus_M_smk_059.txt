  I donÅft think so. There are many smokers in Japan. They smoke to
relieve stresses and people go to restaurant to eat meal and to relax.
In fact, when I go to a cafe, there are often some office workers
resting and smoking. If smoking is completely banned at all the
restaurants, they canÅft relieve stresses there, and in addition, they
may feel unsatisfied. It is nonsense. There are smoking seats and
nonsmoking seats in most restaurants to let nonsmokers and smokers more
comfortable. In that case, restaurants should keep the air completely
clean for fear of not being complained about smoke by nonsmokers.
Å@If smoking is banned at all the restaurants for the purpose of making
smokers stop smoking, it seems to be better to ban selling cigarette.
There will be little change even if smoking is banned only at the
restaurant. Exactly, people may be able to eat meal deliciously by doing
that. But smokers go to other place to smoke. For example, they smoke on
the street, and people have a trouble of their throwing away cigarette
butts. Such a thing will repeat. I think that the most important thing
is decreasing the number of smokers gradually rather than keeping out
them from restaurants.
