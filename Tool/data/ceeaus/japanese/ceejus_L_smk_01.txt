  I do not agree this opinion that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.   Certainly, Smoking makes air dirty and bad smell. Cigarette is bad for the body. It is contain many material that causes cancer. Many smokers are died because of cancers. But the best reason of person not smoking hate Smokers is that smoke from smokers is bud for bodies  too when people breathes it in. This is more effective than smoke themselves. So that, recently, smokers are disliked at almost places.   However,  I think smoking  prohibited all the restaurants is not best way. Certainly smokers and people who don't smoke must be completely separated but cigarettes have been already the heavy part of our culture. Most important thing is that alarm the risk of smoking. So if smokers know It's danger enough, we should allow their smoking places. Like restaurant we can enter with our pet, that we can make smoke can be made.   Some of my friends are smokers. They are good people. It is not good thing hate people because they are smoking. When they save smoking manner, for example don't smoke at public spaces, and don't make trouble to us, we should get along with them.
