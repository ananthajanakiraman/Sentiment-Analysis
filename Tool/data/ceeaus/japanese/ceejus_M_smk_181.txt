 I agree a little that smoking should be banned at restaurants, but I think it is too severe 

for smoker. Surely, smoking is very trouble and unpleasant for non-smoker. I dislike it 

too. However, if smoking is completely banned at all restaurants in Japan, it is hard for 

smoker to eat outside. We should protect not only non-smoker but also smoker. So, I think 

that we should use separation of smoking. I have watched a CM on television about paration 

of smoking and then I thought it good idea. Smoker and non-smoker can talk or 

eat in at the same table by separation of smoking. We can enjoy better life without 

trouble about smoking in this way. 

 In addition, smoking influences human not only bad effects. Certainly, our health is 

harmed by smoking but human who smoke can refresh. I think that why many people 

smoke is this reason. We should look not only bad side but also good side. It is too severe 

for smoker to treat them like as unpleasant one and we must know that we can remove 

the wools between smoker and non-smoker by technology like separation of smoking. 

 So, I agree with a little with smoking should be banned.
