I donÅft agree with this statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Because this statement is too severe to follow. In fact, it is clear that smoking is one of the most causes to lead to cancer. And smoking gives bad influence to not only their own but also around people. I think this is the worst point of smoking. And I need not ban smoking completely. I think that the restaurants should divide into smoking people and not smoking people. GREEN MOS BURGER is a good example. In there, smoking seats are placed outside the shop and non-smoking seats are placed inside the shop. This is very interesting. Few years ago, in there, smoking seats were placed inside the shop. This is cared about this problem. Now at the many restaurants, smoking seats and non-smoking seats are divided inside the shop. I am satisfied with this situation. But the restaurants that are banned smoking are increasing. So if I think about the matter in terms of management, it is good to build the restaurants for smoking people. These are the reasons why I donÅft agree the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
