"I am agreement with most of statement. There are two reasons why I
agree this statement
 and one reason why I donÅft agree this statement. One reason is that
college students
need a lot of money because they have to buy many expensive tests and
pay the cost of
living, for example, to go to their college or to eat, and they spent
their money on
joining club activity or going to party. If they want to live enjoyable
life without
much relying on parents, they make a lot of money by a part-time job.
Another reason is
a part-time job may enable them to experience the social life and learn
what is really is.
This is because money which they had spent on buying their clothes and
going to play and
so on was earned by their parents, so they donÅft understand the value of
money. And,
having a part-time job help them to understand it. That is why it is
certain that I agree
this statement, but, of course, the most important thing for college
students is to study
what they want to learn. Therefore, they should have a part-time job
without forgetting to
study. This is the only point which I donÅft agree this statement."
