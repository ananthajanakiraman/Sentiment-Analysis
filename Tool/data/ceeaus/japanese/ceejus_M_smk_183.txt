I do not think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in Japan. I think that many adult men are smoke. I think that if smoking is completely banned at all the restaurant in Japan, people who smoke will be very angry.  I think that it is a good idea that tables of the restaurant in Japan are maked for people who smoke and for people who do not smoke. Because smoking is very bad for around people of a parson who smokes, I think that people who do not smoke will be very angry when around people smoking in the restaurant. I also feel bad if around people are smoking in the restaurant I do not like smoking. So I do not smoke. So I do not know feeling of people who smoke. I think that people who smoke will be very angry when people who smoke do not smoke for s few hours. In my home, only my father smokes. I feel bad when my father smoke at my next. My father started smoking when he is young. My father knowed that smoking is bad for health. But he started smoking. I think that I will not smoke in the future.
