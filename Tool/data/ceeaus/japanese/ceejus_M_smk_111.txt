I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants
in Japan. Nowadays there is the tendency to prohibit people smoking in
public places, such as in the transport facilities and in the buildings.
Because cigarettes are bad not only for your health but also for other
peopleÅfs health, more and more people gradually hate smoking. First of
all, cigarettes have unique smell, so it makes good dishÅfs smell
vanished and smokers themselves canÅft taste foods. In addition,
cigarettes smoke badly and even if smokers are sit on the different
seats, you will be did harm, since the smoke spreads over the
restaurantÅfs room. In that case, if you are not a smoker, you go to the
restaurant in order to enjoy having a meal but you canÅft do so.
Secondly, it is natural that there are two kinds of people in the world:
smoker and nonsmoker. Restaurant owner have problems about them. For
instance, today, when nonsmokers notice that people smoke in the
restaurant, some of them consent reluctantly to sit down and eat a meal.
But others not only give up entering the restaurant but never go there
as well. This is disadvantage for owner. In conclusion, restaurant is
the place to enjoy eating and should be comfortable place for customers
so as to have more delicious dishes. So you donÅft need smoking there
