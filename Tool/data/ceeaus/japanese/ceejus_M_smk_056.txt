I think that smoking can be harm. So, smoking should be completely
banned at all the restaurants in Japan. When I go to a restaurant, I
almost choice no-smoking seat. But if there is near to smoking seat,
sometimes I feel tobacco smoke. And I become sad, because I dislike
tobacco smoke.

 The environment of place to eat has a great influence on our appetite
and feelings. One of important point is smell containing tobacco smoke.
Cigarette has not only the smell but also smoke coming into our mouth
and eyes. One don`t care cigar smoke, but another might be damaged by
the secondhand smoke. According to circumstances, the customer having
asthma or allergy may come in restaurant. And a pregnant woman or a
small children might sit down in the space being smoke.

 Certainly, smoker have feeling to want to puff at a cigar. But I think
that no-smoking people`s sufferings of smoke are bigger than smoker`s
suppression to smoking. Smoker can smoke in different place and time,
for example outside or park or place where there is not people who
dislike tobacco smoke.

 Now restaurant measure for smoke is not enough. All smoke can`t be
absorbed in an air vent. Restaurant is place where many and various
people gather to enjoy mealtime and eat good-tasting foods. I don`t
understand why we are permitted to smoke in restaurant, while hospital
and office have been restricted. I agree to refuse smoking in
restaurants as one of solution.
