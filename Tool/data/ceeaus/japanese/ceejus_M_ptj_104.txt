" I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time
 job.
 I have two reasons to think so.
 First,we can get money to have a part-time job.In college,the number of
students who live alone is larger than in high school or in junior high
school.We can get some money from our parents,but it is not enough.We
must pay lental house charge,light charge,gus charge and water charge.
We also have to pay breakfast,lunch,dinner and so on.In addition to this
charge,we need to have clubs or play with friends.So,it is not enough
for us to get money from our parents.It is necessary for us to get money.
 Second,we need to learn what job is to do a part-time job.College
students have more time than high school students.It is very efficient
to do a part-time job in that time.We will be social people after
graduate college .We learn what society or social people is before we
will be them to some degree. For example ,how to communicate with other
people,boss,and costomer,how to deal with my mistakes and so on.In there
,we can get some skills which we can not get in school.So,it is
important for us to learn what jobs is and what society is to some
degree.So I think that to have a part-time job is very important for
college students."
