First, I agree with the statement Ågit is important for college students to have a part-time jobÅh
The act of earning money by working would make you feel a satisfaction that you can act as a member of the society.
And whenever you do a part-time job, you may have partners.
I think it a precious experience to work hard to contribute to your office by cooperating with your partners.
But, the most significant reason I agree to a part-time job for is an economical point.
When you become a college student, you will need more money than before.
Of course, the expense includes tuition fee and the cost of living.
And the expense also includes the cost spared for your hobby and play and so on.
I think, it is wrong for you to plead with your parents to pay for such expenses.
You should earn the money that spared for your hobby and play and so on.
So I agree to a part-time job to a great degree.
And in fact, many college students have a part-time job, and I also have it.
But it is the part of a college student to study.
You should not forget it.
