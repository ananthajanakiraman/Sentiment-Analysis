I agree with this statement. Because I don`t smoke the cigarette. And I hate the smell of smoking very much. I think that most Japanese don`t like smoking. The restaurant is a place we eat dishes. So smokers should not smoke there. Even if they smoke in the smoking place, people who are eating become unpleasant feelings only by seeing smoking of cigarette. I think people who want to smoke should smoke outside the restaurant, after they finish eating. In restaurant, there are many people, for example, baby, elderly person, sick person, pregnant woman, and so on. The cigarette may give them the serious damage. And if they smoke in restaurant, the poisonous substances enter the dish. And, when they keep eating it, it will surely harm the body. Smoking damages not only themselves but also others. Thinking this, they should not smoke in public place. If smoking was completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan, Most Japanese would eat more deliciously, and safety. My father also smoked several years ago. But he stopped smoking, because meal became no delicious. Around me, some friends started smoking recently. They said that meal became no delicious, after they had started smoking. So I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
