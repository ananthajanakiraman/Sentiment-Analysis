  I disagree with a opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. To be sure it is said that smoking represents a hundred evils and not a single good.  In fact everyone understands a weak point of smoking.
  For example,people who smoke are missing their appetite. Of course littering of a cigarette is out of the question. To make matters worse,the smoke from people's who smoke cigarette make non smokers feel bad.
  But even considering their weak points of a cigarette it is too disadvantageous that smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants.
  I think that sales at the restaurant decrease if all the restaurants in Jaqpan completely bans smoking. There are some reasons.
  First,I think that people who want to smoke after the meal don't want to go to eat to restaurants which smoking are banned.
  Second,the seat at a restaurant is filled to capacity for the most part when we go to a restaurant to prepare for a test in the evening.
  I think that it is necessary to make a firm barrier between smoking place and non smoking place in order to come true to set up smoking places at restaurants.
  This is why smoking shouldn't be banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
