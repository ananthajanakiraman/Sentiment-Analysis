 I think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job.  Comparing college students with high school students, we can know that college students have much more free time. I think that they had better make this free time valuable. For example, it is important to devote club activities. Through a club activity, they can learn the relationship between senior and junior. ThatÅfs very important for them. This experience must be useful when they are a member of the society. Another way of learning the social relationship, it is useful to have a part-time job. I donÅft belong to any clubs now, but I have two part-time jobs. One is Sushiya, the other is Yakinikuya. At Sushiya, I learned how to cut fish. At Yakinikuya, I learned how to smile for service. Both skills are essential to have a life for oneself, of course to have a life as a member of the society. In addition, students who have a part-time job learn how to manage own money. I think this skill is the most important to be a member of the society. We canÅft get the skill, if we have a campus life simply and belong to a club simply. Therefore, I think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job.
