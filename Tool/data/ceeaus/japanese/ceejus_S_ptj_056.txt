"Should college students work part-time?
Of course I think they should do.
There are four reasons.

First, a lot of students lodge at nearby college.
So, they have to get money because surely their parents
provide them with money, but in many cases, it is so minimum
that practically students donÅft have enough money which they can
use freely.

Second, in cases of students who go to school from their own
house, they have to get money too. Because, there are many
events in college, for example party, so expenses become large.
And at their age, they become reluctant to ask their parents
for money.

Third, social experience is important for students.
They canÅft understand the real value of money until they get
money themselves.
If they understand it, they can know the importance of their
parents who work hard to support them.

And, lastly, in many cases, human canÅft make the most of time
when they have too enough time.
They are in the habit of letting things they have to do wait.
Students who study all day long are rare, and many students
have their free time. If they work part-time, they get limited
time and they can spend it on studying usefully.

Thus, working part-time has many important meanings.
So students should work part-time, but the most important
thing is the compatibility of work with study.
And they must not forget this----studentsÅf main business is,
of course, study!!
