I agree with college student having a part-time job. There are two reasons of student having a part-time job. First case is that students need earn to support themselves. Most people may donÅft disagree with this case. Second case is that not poor students have a part-time job to use for their leisure or hobby. Some people disagree with this case, because they think having a part-time job makes students tend to study less and less. 
 But I think having a part-time job is need for students in second case, because through a part-time job they can learn how to live in a society. Of cause, study is most important for student. So itÅfs not acceptable that a part-time job makes students spend less time for studying. But reading books donÅft teach us how to make relationships with others in our lives. Some people may say students can learn social life through life with friends and parents. But sometimes we need not only to corporate voluntarily but also to compromise with others in our lives. If students have a part-time job, they have to follow their boss or rules in work place. Students learn various kinds of relation with others through a part-time job. So a part-time job helps student learn how to contribute to society.
 When I was high school student, I have a part-time job of pizza delivery. I was not good at pizza delivery. Whenever my boss often scolded me for my job, I felt bad. Since I donÅft want to be scolded, I was hard to listen to bossÅfs operation not to make a mistake. Through a part-time job I learn importance of following wise or skillful people.
