"I think, it is important for college students to have a part-time job.Why I think so? There are two reasons.
 I have a part-time job. I began it since the last spring. In that job, I have learned so many things to suit for society- --Call for customer, how to apologize, how to receive the phone, and so on.We, a college students, should learn and acquire the rule of real society until we take a job. In this respect, a part-time job is the best place to learn and acquire it. That is the first reason.
Second reason is that if we have a part-time job, we can meet many kinds of friends. We can get various vision of life from their friends.
ThatÅfs why I think that a part-time job is important. If you do the part-time job, you can know wrong part of you. This makes you a good adult.
