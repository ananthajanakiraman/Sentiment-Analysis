I agree with banning smoking at the restaurant in Japan completely.
 The most important reason, as you know, is that smoking is bad for
health. Addition to the main cause of lung cancer, it causes other else
kinds of cancer and lung and heart attacks. It is recently said that
smoking might influence to babyÅfs sudden death. A smoker at the
restaurant, where various people including babies are, can be called as
a murderer.
  Secondly there are people who feel bad when they smell tobaccoÅfs
smoke.  I work as a part timer at the Udon shop where isnÅft banned
smoking. Some of customers smoke. Other customers often ask to me that
they want to get the table as possible as away from smokers. And I
myself also feel bad, cannot stop cough and disappear appetite. How to
feel the smoke is different each other. I think shops must think of a
person feel worst.
 When it comes to discuss about smoking, somebody absolutely says that
people who smoke also have free of smoking. I think this is very fool.
Do you have free of killing other people? Do you have free of infecting
other people? Almost all human beings will answer NO. But to claim free
of smoking is to answer YES to these questions. If owners of restaurant
have common sense they must bun smoking completely. (227 words)
