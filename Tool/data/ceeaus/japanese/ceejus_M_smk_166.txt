I agree with the idea. 
 
Nowadays there are less and less people who smoke than there used to be.
It is because a lot of people realize that smoking is very harm to our health.
For example, if pregnancy women smoke, babies in their womb cannot breathe a few seconds and it is said that people who smoke constantly more likely to get cancer of lungs than people who never smoke.
However, if a person smokes at public space such as restaurant, many people who are in there have to smoke passively or escape from there not to smoke passivelyÅD
The worse thing is that passive smoking is more harmful than active smoking.
Although some people say that smoker's rights should be protected, protecting rights of people who don't want to smoke is much more important.
 

In addition, smoking is one of a luxury like drinking but smoking people must have a lot of risks, for instance cigaretto is very expensive due to special tax and very harmful, but they donÅft have any profits different from drinking

Some Japanese people, especially young boys, think that smoking men are so cool under the influences of that a lot of Japanese men smoke at public area, but cigarette is a kind of drags.

We must reject smoking area from public space like restaurant to prevent young people from starting smoke.
