 I agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant   

In Japan.

There are three reasons why smoking should be forbided.

First, smoking is harmful for our health.

My father smoked two box a day. My mother tried hard to break him of the habit of smoking. But father was obstinate in refusing to stop smoking as mother ordered him.

At length, father had a sore throat terribly from smoking too many cigarettes. Father finally overcame his smoking habit.

Second, in the first place, the restaurants are the place where we enjoy dinner or lanch,

Not the place where you smoke. When you enjoy your dinner with your family or your

Friends, if someone smokes next to your table, how do you feel?  If you were me, I got angry entremly and I could not enjoy dinner. And cigarettes smoke makes dinner bad.

Third reason is passive smoking. This reason is the most important reason in my mind. 

I want smokers not to forget what I say following. Passive smokers do not smoke but share their air space with smokers. That is to say, those who never smoke are as same as those who smoke. So the risk that they get lung cancer is nearly same probability.

Accordingly, I agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in Japan.
