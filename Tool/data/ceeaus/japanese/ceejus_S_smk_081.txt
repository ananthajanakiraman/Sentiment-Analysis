I agree with the idea that we should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.

Of course, smokers have the right to smoke, but they should not smoke in the place which smokers may trouble other people. Especially when other people are eating, the smoke makes other people have unwillingness to eat. I change my seat if there is smoker near me when I am eating. Besides, there is another problem. In the restaurant, there is place for smokers and for non smokers. We can choose the room we like to sit down, but in the almost all restaurants, there is nothing to have smoke kept in the room for smokers. As a result, the smoke comes to the room for non smokers. It is obvious that choosing the room is meaningless. Furthermore, cigarette smoke harm people who do not smoke .There are many researches which improve cigarette smoke will cause many kinds of illnesses. It can cause cancer which may kill people. Some foreign countries have already started to ban the cigarette in the public, such as school, station, airport and also restaurant. Japan has to ban smoking at all restaurants, too.
