I agree with this opinion.  Because we can learn what we canÅft learn at school.
For example we learn the contents of the part time job.
It is very natural.  But we donÅft know it until we do the job.
We can know it only after I work.
Then I think we can learn how to contact various people.
At university, it is often that we only contact the people of the same generation of same university.  For instance people of the same faculty or same club and so on.
So we donÅft talk to the people of the other generation or other university students.  But if we do the part time job, opportunities to talk to the people of the other generations or other university students would increase. For that reason we can learn how to contact various people naturally.
And we come to understand importance of the money and difficulty of work. 
I thought to earn the money is not so difficult until I do the part time job.
However it was very difficult.  I am very tired from little work.
Accordingly I thank my parents more than before beginning a part time job.
So I think it is important for college students not studying at school but also doing a pat time job.
