I donÅft agree with that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
Today, in Japan, you may often see signs ÅgNo smokingÅh at many places. For example, you can find that at offices, colleges and stations. It is sure that smoking is bad for our health, not only smoker but also nonsmoker. But I think these days movements against smoking go too far. In this topic, it just solve by separating smoking people from no-smoking people.
 From the beginning, a restaurant is space to relax. Although smoking harm oneÅfs health, smoking relax smoker. So I think we should think not prohibit smoker from smoking but how separate smoker from nonsmoker. Too interfering with people who have different thought is not good for our society. It is better that we find the way to live together in same place. So I think this topic is very trivial. It needs just a little device. The equipment that separate people who smoke from people who donÅft smoke become the solution, I think. So we have not need to think Ågall or nothingÅh.
 From these reason, I donÅft agree with smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
