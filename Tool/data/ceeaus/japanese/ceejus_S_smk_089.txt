Now that in Japan everywhere we go, we can hardly find a place where people can smoke.

And if we enter a restaurant, we often see a situation that a lot of people wait for nonsmoking seats in spite of smoking seats are vacant. I think the situation indicates 

That a large number of people dislike cigarette smoke and itÅfs bad smell.

It is unendurable for them who donÅft like cigarette to have a food in smoke and smell.

Now everyone knows smoking have harmful effects for our body, lung and heart and brain and so on. If you smoke a cigarette, you become a bad condition and you canÅft become a healthy condition. Those effects affect not only smoker but also nonsmoker. And if you smoke while you are still young, you may be able to give up smoke. 

No one welcome to suffer from illness or die of illness for smoking.

Smoking is no good and only do harm.

Accordingly the entire restaurant in Japan doesnÅft have to prepare smoking seats for smoker and nonsmoker.

And because of people canÅft smoke in restaurant, smoker may give up smoking little by little. I think all restaurants in Japan should ban smoking entirely.
