"I think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job.
 Why I think so is that college students are semi-working people. To
work is one of the important things for people to live in a society. So
I think to have a part-time job is important.
 For example, I work in the private school as a teacher. In the work, I
learn many things, that is to say, common senses. I think those senses
are necessary to live in a society. Part-time job is very appropriate to
practice to lead your life in society, I think.
 And, to earn money is another thing important for college students. We
are not working adults. But, we are not entirely children, too. So I
think, college students have to work to earn money, which they use for
them to go shopping, drink, or travel. The money for their leisure must
be paid by their own. I ,too, pay my train fare.
 Eventually, what I want to say is Ågpart-time job is a way to study what
society isÅh. To learn that is difficult, so part-time job is
surprisingly useful for that. If it was a trivial experiment, we study
something advantageous for us.
