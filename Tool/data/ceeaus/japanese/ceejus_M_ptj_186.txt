I think that it is important for college students to have a part time job. But I think that it is not good for high school students to have a part time job. I think that high school students have a lot of things to study. For example, English, math, history, Japanese, and so on. High school students have to take a college entrance exam. I think that college students have more important things than a part time job. I think that high school student are little younger for having a part time job. On the other hand, I think that college students have more free times high school students have. I think that a college student can learn a lot of important things about our society. For example, human relationship, true value of money, hardships of getting money, and so on. I am male, so I have a part time job just now. I have a part time job now. In a part time job, I do a lot of mistakes. But I think that these experience should become important things in my future. But I think that the most important thing for a college student and a high school student is studying.
