I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Roughly, I have two reasons to agree with this proposal. 
First of all, those who smoke are minority. These days, the population of smoking is decreasing gradually. In fact, according to JT, 10 years ago, 56.1% of Japanese men smoked. But, in 2005, only 45.8% of Japanese men smoke. So, no smoking is the trend of these days. We should not ignore this chance. In addition, the rate of Japanese women smoke is only 13.8%. Simply, only 30% of Japanese people smoke. It is not wise, not efficient to satisfy only 30% of people, and to dissatisfy 70% of people. It is so crazy! So, we need not think about the minority ? those who smoke. We should think about Ågthe greatest happiness of the greatest numbersÅh(Jeremy Bentham). 
Secondly, the smoke of tobaccos makes people who donÅft smoke feel unhappy. At least, in Japan, eating is regarded as the part of the culture. Eating is the part of our happiness. So, eating is very important, cultural, and holy. But, smoking destroys it. Smoke destroys the perfume, and the taste of meals. No, not only the meals, but also they destroy the culture of eating! So, as it were, smoke is the destroyer. It can call smoke as offender. I canÅft put up with it! So, I want to expel smoke from restaurants!
