I really agree with this opinion. Maybe someone says itÅfs a waste of
time for the students, but I never think so. Because I regard it not as
a way of getting money but as a sight of the society.
I also have a part time job, then I found some good points of it.

At first, itÅfs so important to do what weÅfve never done. The experience
gives us new ideas. And I think young people can get more and better
ideas from things. The dramatic change from receiver to server might
give us some big discovery.

Second, in near future weÅfll have a work anyway, so it  becomes a good
practice and a useful information for choosing a job. Take me for
example, when I was a small childe I wanted to become a cook of cakes,
then as I became a collage student I had a part time job of cake shop
assistant. So I was glad (a part of) my dream came true, but in same
time I knew the work is hard so much. And I though itÅfs just good for me
to be an assistant of cook.

Third, working enable us to feel the relationship with the society
keenly. When I was given a pay the first time in my life, I felt as if I
was admitted from the society. And I realized I would soon become an adult.

As long as we donÅft neglect study that is our main job, we could get the
thing what is more than the pay from a part time job.
