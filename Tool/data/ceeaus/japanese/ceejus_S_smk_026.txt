I agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. This is because smoking is bad for health. We hear too smoking causes cancer. We often see people eat smoking in restaurants. Restaurants should be comfortable space for us to enjoy eating delicious foods and talking with companions. Even if one person smokes in the restaurants, all the air in the room is polluted by smoke. No one should wish this situation. The idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants is not only for people who donÅft smoke but people who often smoke. People who smoke often contain people who want stop smoking but canÅft stop smoking. In order to decrease the number of the people who smoke often, I think we should decrease the place that gives the chance of smoking. By reducing the time when people can smoke, people who want to stop smoking but canÅft stop smoking get to have the confidence that they can lead their life without smoking. There are many people who often smoke at home or outside, but the number of the people who smoke includes the number of the people who afraid of stopping smoking. We should help such people by supporting them and making the surroundings that people can get to stop smoking easily.
