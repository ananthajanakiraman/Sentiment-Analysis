I agree with the opinion that smoking is banded completely in restaurant. There are two reasons for my insistence. First reason is that cigarette do harm to around people. cigarette consists of a lot of harmful substances. When cigarette is fired, the smoke which contain these substances is exhausted from top of the cigarette. The smoke cause lung cancer. Around people breathe the smoke though they don't want to. I can't understand the behavior which disregard health of other people. It's very egotistic thought. Second  reason is about food. Smell of cigarette is very strong,so it prevent people from enjoying food's flavor. Though chef cook hardly thinking flavor or tastes, smoke spoil them. Final reason is about manner. I think that smoking is bad manner at the place of lunch or dinner. If my partner smoke when I go to restaurant and eat dinner with him I get displeased. I can't think that though they are heavy smoker they can't stand to smoke for only 1 or 2 hours during they eat. If they can't stand to smoke at the table anyway, they should leave the seat and go out of restaurant or go to smoking area. Eventually, by forbidding smoking completely at restaurant a lot of people can spend having lunch or dinner comfortably. Moreover restaurant is one of the places which make a point of food's flavor or taste and atmosphere. Therefore smoker should refrain from smoking at the very least at restaurant.
