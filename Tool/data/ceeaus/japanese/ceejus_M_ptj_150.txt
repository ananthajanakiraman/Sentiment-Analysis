"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.There are some reasons I think so.Frist,college students often spent somemoney,for example,clothe

,party,travelÅc So,they must earn money for some extend.With little money,our college life becomes very miserable.In my case,I didnÅft buyÅ@many things and seldom go to play in the last year of my high-schooldays,to  pass the entrance exam.And I have thought that when I pass the exam and become a college student,I do all things I want to do.I have passed exam,so, all I have to do is do all my favorite things. For it,I have a part-time job and do what I want to do.Second,a experience of working is needed to be a good adult.Working gives us another point of view,for instance,I was only a buyer,but I can be a seller and I can see another aspect of the world.In my case,I wanted to work in a restaurant and receive a appointment.And I went there just on time without no doubt,and after meeting,a man came to me and said thatÅuDo you have any common sense?You  had to come here at least before 5minutes.ItÅfs too rude.If  you do such thing next,you canÅft work here! ÅvI said nothing but I was very angry because I thought thatÅuI know it is good to do so,someone said it.But I was said it is good to go just on time,because to go early is very annoying thing.Åv I had had bad impression about the restaurant for a few days,but oneday  I noticed.Everyone has their own idea and there isnÅft true thing,and we must accord our ideas.It is me who must change my idea to the restaurant.We must study our society like this.So,college student should have a part-time job.
