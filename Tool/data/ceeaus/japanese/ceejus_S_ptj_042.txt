I agree with this opinion.

Firstly, a part-time job gives us various experiences. For example, we are able to get chances to communicate with many people from young to elderly persons. We can understand social systems. We will realize how important to have a responsibility to our jobs. I think these experiences can make our life better. We will not be able to get a chance to have these experiences in college. It is important for us to know how real world is going as well as to study economics, literature and agriculture and others.

Secondly, I think we should earn money to go to college on our own. We have to pay huge money in order to study at college. It is too hard to pay for this only by ourselves, but we should help our parents as much as we can. We have to never forget that they work hard for us everyday.

Lastly, taking a part-time job will help us to use our time productively. We are limited to use time to spend on recreations or leisure activities by taking a part-time job, but this also lets us not to spend our time meaninglessly.

For these three reasons, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. 

Thank you.
