"I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Because we can learn how to do in society if we have a part-time job. Almost all of us do not know the manner to talk with senior people in society. So we need to learn how to talk with the senior people. Besides it is necessary for the students who live by themselves to have a part-time job. Because the students who live by themselves need some money to live. They must buy foods, clothes, soaps and so on. And they must pay charge of gas, water and so on. And we can make friends with the colleagues of the part-time job. And we can notice how important the money is by having a part-time job. So we will rarely get to waste our money. We will think carefully when we use our money. You think that if we have a part-time job, we will not get to study hard in college. But there are many people who have a part-time job and study very hard in college. Because of these reasons, I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
