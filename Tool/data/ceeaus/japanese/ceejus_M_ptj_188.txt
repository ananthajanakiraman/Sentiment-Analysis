I think that a part-time job is very important and precious in our college life. Because we don`t know the society very well. Doing a part-time job can tell us the society. And we can acquire common sense. If we didn`t have a part-time job, we wouldn`t get it. And not doing a part-time job is lost much money. Actually, I didn`t have a part-time job in summer vacation. Then I was playing with my friends every day and night. So, I was lost much money. What other thing of a part-time job is that our human relations spread widely. If human relations spread widely, we would be able to enjoy our life. Indeed, we may be restricted our free time, but we can get much better things. And by doing a part-time job, we can help our parents. Our parents send me rent and living costs every month. I think that I want to earn my living costs by myself. In the future, I must be going to earn my living costs and family`s. From now, if we don`t know the difficulty of earning, we would have trouble surely. So, it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
