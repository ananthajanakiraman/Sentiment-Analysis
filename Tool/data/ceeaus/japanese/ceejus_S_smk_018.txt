I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. There are some reasons that I insist on in this way. First, this may not be known widely; more than 4,000 kinds of chemical substances are included in the smoke of the cigarette. And surprisingly, as for the chemical substances more than 200 kinds of those, harmfulness is proved. Three materials which are the most famous for such a toxic material are tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide. It is proved that these materials induce the fatal diseases such as cancer, heart trouble, and the cerebral infarction medically. Second, this is to be connected with the first reason, there is the problem of people around the smoker. These problems are generally called the problems of passive smoking, the passive smoker take in the toxic substances in the body just to be in the place. Besides, according to the medical study, it proved that influence that the smoke of the cigarette is worse for a woman and a minor. The restaurant is the place where various people gather for a meal, there may be the people who want to refuse smoking in there. Because the restaurant is a place to eat not a place to smoke. So I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
