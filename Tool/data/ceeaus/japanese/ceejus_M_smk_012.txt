I agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. There are three reasons why smoking should be prohibited.
	First, smoking is bad for our health. Smoke contains some harmful substances and they often cause cancer. It does harm not only to a smoker himself but also to people who are around him and never smoke because of him. So smoking is not good at all.
	Second, smoke has very bad smell. It gives pain to people who are around a smoker and do not smoke. At restaurants there are little children as well as adults, who dislike smoke.
	Lastly, at restaurants there are many families, lovers, friends, and so on. If someone starts smoking at such place, they will feel badly and their happy time will be soiled. Only one smoker sometimes brings discomfort to everyone there.
	So I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. In addition, I hope that tobacco completely vanished all over the world. If so, I can live more comfortably and happily every day!!
