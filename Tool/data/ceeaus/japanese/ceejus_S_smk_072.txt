Nowadays, at almost restaurants in Japan, we can choose a smoking seat or a 
nonsmoking seat. However, I donÅft prefer this idea. I think smoking should 
be prohibited in every seat at the restaurant.

  For one reason, smoking is bad for your health in the first place. It is 
said that smokers are easy to become lung cancer. If a smoker stops smoking, 
he may be able to live much longer.

  For another, smoking does harm not only to smoker, himself, but also to 
nonsmokers, others. This is called Ågpassive smokingÅh, and nonsmokers are 
forced to breathe in smoke from a cigar somebody else is smoking. At the 
same time, some people become displeased to see smoking people. It is the 
place where everyone enjoys eating out with family, lovers, or friends that 
the restaurant should be.

  What is more, a large number of children come to the restaurant with their 
family. If children see smoking people in the restaurant, they may think 
ÅgSmoking is permitted everywhere.Åh This is bad for children educationally. 
Parents have an obligation to make their children have good manners in the 
future.

  For these reasons, I think smoking should be strictly forbidden at all the 
restaurants in Japan. Then, everyone can be happy and enjoy eating a 
delicious dish at the restaurant.
