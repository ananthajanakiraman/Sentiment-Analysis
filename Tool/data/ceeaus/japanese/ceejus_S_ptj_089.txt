"I agree that college students do a part-time job. This is because I teach junior high school
 students as a tutor now. One month have passed and I feel that I improve my ability to comm
unication and accumulate social experience. I made a decision to continue it in early stage.

 When college students become independent of their parents in the near future, they will nee
d a lot of things such as economical and psychological independence.  A part-time job is sui
table because it forces them to know society rules.
 By the way, some people say that college students should not do a part-time job but a club 
activity. But I think that only a part-time job has something that we cannot learn from a cl
ub activity. For example, obeying a vertical relationship is more severely required in socie
ty. Also, they earn money by themselves and will learn its importance. The best way is that 
they actually experience. This is why a part-time job gives more useful things than a club a
ctivity.
 Few college students have done a part-time job until now. They have freedom and responsibil
ity of their actions. They are almost equal to a member of society. It is better for college
 students in order to be accustomed to society and learn their position of college students.
