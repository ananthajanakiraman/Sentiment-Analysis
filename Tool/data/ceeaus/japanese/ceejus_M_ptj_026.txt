I agree with the statement. This is because college students can get much ability for life and find a job that makes the best oh their ability by doing various kinds of part-time jobs.
First, they can learn how to communicate with people, especially older persons. When they were students in junior high and high school, they may have had the relationship with the seniors. So they may be able to keep company with the older persons well. But I think the relation will not be accepted in society. In addition, by having a part-time job, they talk with many people without regard to age or sex and gain much experience and knowledge.
Second, they can obtain a sense of responsibility. When they were students, they can be absent from school easily. But if they go out into the society, they canÅft do so. 
 Third, they can earn money by themselves. By that, they understand the importance of money and the difficulty of earning money. As for me, before having a part-time job, I sometimes waste money on impulse buying. But after that, I want to save money that I earn by myself, so I canÅft buy things easily. As a result, I can obtain a sense of the value of money.
Therefore, I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
