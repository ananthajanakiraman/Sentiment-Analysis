I agree with the statement. But I have a term to have a part-time job.
 The term is that college students have to have reasons to have a
part-time job. We students have much time we can use freely. In my
opinion, students should do what they can do only now. For example, we
can study what we like, we have dream and go ahead the dream. However,
when we graduate from college and start to work, we will be limited by
work. So time we can use will be little. It is not until I started to
have a part-time job that I realized that how important time is.
 But, some students must have a part-time job to make money. For
example, getting a car license. I think that college students have to
make money by themselves.
 Moreover there are some students who use their time in vain. Such
students should have a part-time job and they will realize importance of
their time.
 In this way, we are different from our reasons to work. We are now
college students. So I think that we must decide whether we should work
or not. In this opinion, I agree with the statement. But if students try
to work, they must have certain reasons to work.
