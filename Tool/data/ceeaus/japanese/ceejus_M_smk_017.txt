I disagree with the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at the restaurants in Japan. The reason to disagree with it is that it is too severe.
I do not smoke and dislike smoking. Smoking is very bad for the health of smoking people and people around smoking people. Also smoking costs highly. In restaurants, smoking makes delicious foods bad. I think smoking has no merit. But people who want to smoke exist. For such people, I think areas where people can smoke should be placed. That smoking place is not left makes smoking people stressful. If drinking is completely banned like the same reason, I canÅft stand it.
But I want to say about smoking. Though I think smoking places should be kept, some smoking people smoke in the place where people must not smoke. I donÅft excuse it. Some people dislike smoking very much and anther people may become sick for it. Smoking people must keep the rules and have good manners of smoking. If they completely do that, I think smoking does not have to ban. Smoking itself is legal and for people to smoke is free. As long as people donÅft trouble the other when they do something, everyone doesnÅft have a right to ban it.
