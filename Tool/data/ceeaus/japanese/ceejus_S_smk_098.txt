The smoke of tobacco has a bad effect on the health not only for those who
smoke, but also for those who donÅft.Nevertheless, there are many people who
smoke to relax themselves and they smoke everywhere. It is not desirable
that people who donÅft smoke are harmed by people who smoke.So it is the
best way to ban smoking by law.But it is expected that heavy smokers will
intensively react against the regulation and the tax of tobacco will not
exist if government prohibits that people smoke.In this situation, it is the
second best way to separate those who hate the smoke of tobacco from those
who like smoking.This idea can apply to the problem whether restaurants in
Japan should completely prohibit for the customers to smoke or not.To ban
smoking perfectly leads the decrease of customers who want to smoke
there.But allowing them to smoke wherever in the restaurants makes the
customers from having a meal there.Therefore it is good that the restaurants
provide where the customers can smoke and where smoking is banned.In this
case, it is important to divide two spaces completely in order to prevent
smoke from moving from one space to another space.These effort make both of
these type people feel comfortable when they meal in the restaurants.
