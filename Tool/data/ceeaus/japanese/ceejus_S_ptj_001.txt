I agree with the following statement.
I have three reasons why college students need a part-time job.
One reason is that they should experience outside job and learn many things.
For example when you work in Macdonald, you will experience got angry and praised 
by your boss. And you will learn what you should do and what you shouldnÅft do.
So you can develop yourself in the society.
Next reason is that they want to earn money to play.
Of course college students need much money to play with friends and buy clothes and 
pay a house rent.
If they donÅft earn money, their mother must spend money to save their live cost.
So in order to support home spending money they should have part-time job.
Third reason is that they need money for study.
They can study many things in colleges while college students.
They work harder and get money, and they stock money to buy books and go abroad and get qualification.
This is why college students should have a part-time job.
But I think balance is important.
If they work a part-time job harder and harder and they can spend no time studying,
I think there is no use having a part-time job.
So college students should work a part-time job to think balance between study and work.
