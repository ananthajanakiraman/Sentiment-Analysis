I think that college students should have a part time job as they can, because they

can decrease their parentsÅf burdens by earning money for their selves and

it is good for them to do so.

Generally, college students have a lot of free times and they should spend the

times effectively. Moreover, they enjoy free times or holidays by the money they

earned. 

However, it may said that it have some bad aspects for college students to have

a part time job. One of them is that the times for studying is decreased by the 

part time job, but I don't think that a college student who have a part time job can't

study enough. That reason is that we are able to learn manners and greeting through

a part time job. Certainly, studying is one of the most important things for college

students ,but it is one of the most important thing to have some experiences to work in

society too. For living in the future, we need to work and earn money, so we had better than to be accustomed to work early as possible.

Now I don't have any part time job, and I want to have, if there wasn't any examination 

and I could have many free times.
