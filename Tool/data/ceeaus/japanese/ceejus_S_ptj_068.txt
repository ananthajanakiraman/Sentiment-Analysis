"I think that it is important for college student to have a part-time job. There are 3 reasons for that.

First, they can earn money to enjoy their campus lives.

Almost all the college students want to enjoy their campus life. But, without money, they couldnÅft enjoy happy things such as going to the theater, traveling abroad, doing outdoor activity and so on. What is worse, without money, they couldnÅft continue cultural life as a human being! (having meals, washing clothes and so on)

They also lose chances to experience various kinds of things which will benefit them when they become members of society. For example, a man who traveled abroad in his school days can easily make friends with people who come to Japan for business.

 Second, they can experience many jobs. 

A part-time job usually requires less responsibility than a full-time job. So, college students can go to various kinds of business communities and learn introduction to various kinds of jobs. In other words, they can acquire many skills with less responsibility in their school days. Through experiencing various jobs, they may find a suitable job. And if they the job, they can find new jobs thanks to the skills acquired in their school days!

Third, they can learn the systems of society. For example, they can learn how money circulates or how to make good connection with people. These knowledge will be very useful when they become members of society.
