It doesn't have to be banned I think.

These days many people smoke in restaurants during meal. And they enjoy the smoke to their hearts' content.

But Smoke of tobacco can be so uncomfortable for some of non-smoking people.  And when they're eating it must be more.  I don't know why some people like to smoke during meal. They don't smell good. They don't feel comfortable.  Have lunch with enjoying the annoying smoke?  It's stupid.

In the other hand I know some people love smoking so that they say they may "die" if they didn't smoke for so long time. Then what should restaurants do to solve the problem of tobacco?  There will be an answer of mine;

Restaurants all over the world, not only in Japan, should have another room divided by wall with door.  And the door may be small as much as it works.  Then both smoking people and non-smoking people may be fan during in the restaurant.

I know this can be too strict for the most of the people.  But I dislike the smoke of tobacco so much at least during the diet.
