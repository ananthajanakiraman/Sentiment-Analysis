I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I have two reasons. One of the reasons is that the smell of a tobacco is very bad smell. The smell of a tobacco often makes the people around a smoking person feel bad. When you want to have a good lunch, if you feel very bad, what do you feel this lunch?  If I am this situation, I feel very bad and very angry. I can not eat deliciously this lunch. You will feel it in the same way, too. For example, when you eat the matsutake, how will you think if you smoke in the circumference? The matsutake is food enjoying smell. Maybe you can not enjoy smell. 

Second reason is that the tobacco gives person harms. It is natural that a smoking person takes harms, but the person around a smoking person will take harm. I think, but it is good to suffer damage themselves by a smoking person, it is not good to suffer from smoking people. Even if it is impossible to give up smoking, a smoking person should go out of a restaurant to smoke. I want to be only a restaurant where we can enjoy eating!
