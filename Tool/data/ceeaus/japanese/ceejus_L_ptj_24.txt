" I agree with this opinion. Because I think that a part-time job tells us 
many important things, for example, formal actions, manners, communication 
ability, and relationships with many people.
 One month ago, I started a part-time job. I wash a lot of dishes and take 
some drinks and delicious foods at sushi restaurant. Sometimes, there are 
some high-ranked persons such as a boss of a big company, a famous baseball 
player, or a doctor of a big hospital in this restaurant. So, I must take 
formal actions for them. But there are no manuals, and I have to consider 
how I take for them.
 In this sushi restaurant, there are five college students to work as a 
part-timer. They are second or third grad, so, we can be friends easily. 
Especially, one girl is my classmate and my friend since last year. Several 
times, we went to the sushi restaurant together. Because she has worked at 
this restaurant since last year, she teaches me many works and rules. 
Through this part-time job, we make good friendship.
 I think that a part-time job tells us many important things, and I think 
that it can make us a good person, too. We are student now. But about three 
years later, we will be workers in social world. I think that I havenÅft 
prepared to be a worker yet, but now is a chance to prepare. A part-time job 
is very important for us. It tells us many important things. So, I think it 
is important for college students to have a part-time job.
