I agree with the statement ÅgIt is important for college students to have a part-time job.Åh There are three reasons to support my answer.
 First, I donÅft have much money, so I cannot help getting some money by working. I recently move to Kobe and live there by myself now. My mother always sends some money every month. But I must earn some money because there are too many things I want to buy. This is the first reason why I have a part-time job.
 Second, it can be useful to have a part-time job when I graduate from Kobe University and work for a company. I give an example. I worked at a convenience store during summer vacation last year. I worked hard, and I could learn consumerÅfs needs, business skills about the reception, hospitality, and so on through the job. That is why I understand the importance of a part-time job.
 Third, as I work, I get to make out the pleasure of the job. For example, I taught a high school student as a part-time job in September last year. He was poor at mathematics, so I kept teaching mathematics. Fortunately, his grade became good. Then he said to me,Åh Thank you.Åh I was happy to hear the word, and knew the fun. That is why I support my answer.
 Therefore, I agree with the statement ÅgIt is important for college students to have a part-time job.
