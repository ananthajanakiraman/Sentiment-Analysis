I donÅft agree the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in Japan. I think it is problem to prohibit smoking completely. There are two reasons why smoking shouldnÅft be entirely banned.
 First, tobacco has strong dependence. A lot of smokers canÅft stop smoking even if they want to break their habit of smoking. If people who are smoking really stop smoking, they must have fixed preparation. It would take long time to succeed in no smoking.
 Second, there are many smokers in Japan. We canÅft disregard the population of smoking people.
 Today, the treatment for smokers becomes more and more severe. For example, smoking is basically prohibited in platform and shopping center. It is permitted only in smoking room.
 Like this, I think we should not ban completely but divide between smoking seats and nonsmoking seats at all the restaurant in Japan. If smoking is banned completely, smokers would be dissatisfied. But of course it must not be entirely allowed. If itÅfs not divided, people who donÅft smoke would be displeased. There are a lot of people who hate tobacco because itÅfs fact that smoking injures our health. We should consider both of them.
 So I think smoking shouldnÅft be completely banned at the entire restaurant in Japan.
