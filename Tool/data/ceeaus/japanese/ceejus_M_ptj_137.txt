"I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.I think that college students have to play.If they don't play,they are not college students.But,when they play,they need much money.Therefore,they must have a part-time job to earn money for their play.Some adults say that it is not important for collge students to have a part-time job,but I can't understand their idea.This is because college students work for not only theirselves but also our society.After they earn,they spend for their play,and business become active,and adults enjoy high salaries.In other words,evepyone become happy by college student's part-time job.But,college students must not only play but also study.I think that it is bad that college students who don't study hard have part-time job.Therefore,I think that they need to live hard.College student need to eat food,drink,wear clothes,take a bath,brush his or her teeth,ride a bicycle,love others,wash clothes,wash 
dishes,watch television,listen to music,communicate with various people,study hard,play hard and work hard for not only himself or herself but also his or her society."
