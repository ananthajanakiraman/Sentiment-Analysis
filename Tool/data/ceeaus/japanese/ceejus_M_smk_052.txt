I think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. There are two reasons for this.
  One is that restaurant is essentially not where we smoke but where we eat. I think the people who smoke at restaurants can not understand this perfectly. Indeed, some nonsmokers refuse to eat at the restaurants which are not completely nonsmoking. I do not want to eat at such restaurants, either. Although it is not quite that I can not understand the smokers, who want to smoke in having a rest at places such as restaurant and train, I think all restaurants should be completely nonsmoking from the point of view that more people can eat more comfortably. We are usually at a restaurant for about an hour. I think it is not hard for the people who smoke at restaurants to refrain from smoking for only about an hour.
  The other is that the health damage by passive smoking is worried. Passive smoking is that nonsmoker is obliged to breathe the tobacco smoke regardless of or against his or her wish. According to researches, it turned out that the harmful substances in the tobacco smoke which rises from the top of tobacco are much larger in quantity than those in the tobacco smoke which smoker breathe in directly. In short, nonsmoker is in danger when smoker is around nonsmoker. I think the restaurant, where tobacco smoke is hard to diffuse, is particularly dangerous place for nonsmoker.
  For two reasons mentioned above, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. I think the Japanese government should legislate against smoking at all restaurants as soon as possible.
