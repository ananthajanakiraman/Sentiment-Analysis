I think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job.
For a college student, the cost of living is one of the most serious matters.
A student gets allowance from his parents may be able to live on it and be able to afford to spend it on social expenses.
On the other hand, for a student canÅft receive allowance from his supporter, the income from a part-time job is the only support for the cost of living.
In fact, he must spend his money on not only the cost of living but also study and social expenses, if he joins a club, it goes without saying that he will have to pay the club dues.
If he has two or three part-time job, he might not be able to manage his campus life. 
Moreover, a part-time job helps a student to prepare for his independence. 
If he will have a part-time job, he can get common knowledge of this work and the sense of the value of money and he can experience human relations about this work.
And then, he more kinds of task he will experience, the better these experiences help him. 
When he is interviewed for jobs, these experiences will make him into attractive parson for interviewer.  
Like these, a part-time job is brimful of advantage.
