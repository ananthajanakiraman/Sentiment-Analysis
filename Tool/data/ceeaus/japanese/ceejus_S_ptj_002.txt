 I think that it is important for college students to have a part time job. I have some reasons.
 First, collage students have a lot of time. So they should use their time efficiently.  It is good that they use their free time to study, but I think to have a part time job is better. Because I think that it is good chance for them to learn earning money themselves. Most college students will have to work to live themselves after graduating their college. To have a part time job, they can get use to working in society. And they will have confidence. 
 Second, college students are about 20 years old. I think that they should independent from their parents. I think they donÅft need to earn all money to study at college, but they should not think that their parents always pay money for them. They should make an effort to earn money themselves. I think if they can earn money themselves, their parents will be happy and relieve. Because I think it is proof which they are members of society that they can earn money themselves.    
 From these reasons, it is good for college student to have a part time job.
