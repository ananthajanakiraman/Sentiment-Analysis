I am agreeable in this opinion. I think that I should prohibit not only the restaurant but also the smoking at all public places. The smoking hurts not only the health of the person himself sucking in but also the health of neighboring people because there are two kinds of active smoking and the passive smoking for smoking. Needless to say, the active smoking means that someone smokes. The passive smoking means that I breathe smoke appearing from a cigarette.  If there is a person sucking in near in spite of not wanting to smoke, someone will do passive smoking. In brief, many people are made to do the smoking that they do not hope by active smoking people. In a more terrible thing, passive smoking is worse in health than active smoking.  A passive smoking people are unpleasant and are bad in health, and there is not a good thing at all. Therefore the active voice smoking people should think about surroundings and smoke in oneÅfs house or the smoking space. I sit in the non-smoking seat by all means at the restaurant because I was not able to eat food deliciously owing to the smoke near person who smoked. However, smoke comes to the place that is near to the smoking seat in the non-smoking seat, and it is often that there is no non-smoking seat when it is crowded. So I agree this opinion.
