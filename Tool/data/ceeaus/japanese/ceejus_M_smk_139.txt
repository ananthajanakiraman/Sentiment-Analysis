Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
I agree with this statement. Smoking is a treasury of toxic substances, such as nicotine, tar and so on. Nicotine leads smoker to toxicosis, and tar triggers lung cancer. Smoking causes toxicosis or cancer not only to the smoker but also to the nonsmoker who is around the smoker. This kind of nonsmoker is called Åga passive smoker.Åh In general, a passive smoker hates the smoke from a cigarette due to its smell and an impression of its harm. So it is disagreeable for a passive smoker in the restaurant. It is not complicated to imagine that smoke in the restaurant decreases customersÅf appetite when they have lunch or dinner.
Nowadays, smoking is almost entirely banned in public places, but many restaurants have smoking area or seats for smokers. I think however, smoking in the restaurant should be prohibited before everywhere else, for customers must be in the restaurant for a long time, from half an hour to an hour if long. The longer they are in the restaurant, the heavier they harmed by smoke if someone has a smoke. In these points, there is no need to dare to smoke in the restaurant.
