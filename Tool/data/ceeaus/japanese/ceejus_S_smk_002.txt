ÅgSmoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in JapanÅh
I agree to this opinion on the whole.

I dislike tobacco and I think it is worth than useless. It cause lung cancer and have a bad influence upon babies especially for women who has babies. So I wish tobacco died from all over the world. 
I understand that I should allow smokers also have the right to smoke. If he or she hopes to smoke, we canÅft invade his or her right to smoke. But I canÅft endure being made to breathe the smoke. What we allow smokers to do is the right to smoke only for them, not the right to make others smoke. Smokers must not mistake this point. That is to say, I think smokers must not smoke in the place where they canÅft account for their smoke.Å@The restaurant is the place where men and women of all ages come. So I think smokers must not smoke in the restaurant.
I have one more reason. Breathing the smoke, we canÅft savor the original taste and smell of food. If there are no smoking seats, the smoke float and come to the seats. People who donÅft smoke canÅft enjoy their dinner after all. So I think smoking should be banned completely.
