It is often said that smoking is not good for your health. Do you agree or disagree with this? Indeed, smoking causes many kinds of diseases, such as lung cancer and heart disease. Because of tobacco-related illness, around 5 million people die each year.Å@Judging from this, we can say tobacco is very dangerous for our health. Moreover tobacco is harmful not only for the very person smoking cigarettes but also for those who are around there. 

So these days, a lot of countries are beginning to prohibit smoking. Similarly in Japan, elementary school and junior high school began to ban smoking in their ground, and most of the public places donÅft allow people to smoke. But not all the restaurants in Japan, where plenty of customers visit every day, ban smoking. It is not reasonable that smoking is not banned at all the restaurants. : Restaurants are the places where various kinds of people gather, of course including those who donÅft smoke. So it is natural to consider if you smoke a cigarette at the restaurant, it troubles no-smokers around you. In the first place, a restaurant is a place where people enjoy meal, not in the least people feel displeasure. We cannot find any advantages to allow people to smoke cigarettes at the restaurants. 

 In conclusion, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
