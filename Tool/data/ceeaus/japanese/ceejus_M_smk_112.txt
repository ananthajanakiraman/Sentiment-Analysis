I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.

Nowadays, more restaurants in Japan separate nonsmoking seats from smoking seats. However, nonsmoking seats often become full soon and people who donÅft smoke have to sit smoking seats. 

I hate smoke of cigarette. It smells bad and penetrates into clothes. In addition, it makes me have a sore throat. For instance, guess that you have a dinner with your family cheerfully. On that time, if a man who smokes next to your table, smell of cigarette will spoil your delicious dishes and make you feel unpleasant.

When I see a man smoking in a public place, I get angry very much. Smoking, of course, makes smokers unhealthy. Moreover, smoke of cigarette has a bad influence on people who donÅft smoke. Smoking makes a possibility of getting cancer high.  There may be a pregnant mother or a baby in a restaurant. 

And so if smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan, people who dislike a cigarette can enjoy themselves without being irritated about otherÅfs smoke. What is more, smokers have less opportunities of smoking and so, they can become healthy.

I hope smoking will be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan soon.
