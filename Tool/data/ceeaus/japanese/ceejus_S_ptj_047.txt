Å@I agree with the statement that it is important for college students
to have a part-time job. I have a two reason for this.
Å@First, they can know how to make money in society. If they donÅft have
a part-time job, they get some money from their family. This situation
isnÅft good. College students will work and make money after having
graduated. Then, they should know to work. In addition, it is the burden
on their family that they are given money by their family. Their family
pays a lot of money for them. Ever they couldnÅft make money, but they
can do now. They should earn money to use their selves.
Å@Second, they can search their lifework or work in the place that they
want to work. Especially, people who have a dream of working at specific
place, such as a TV station, a company of news or company of creating
animation should have a part-time job. It is important for them to have
experience to work there, because they can actually know the real job,
what to do and how to do. And people who donÅft think their lifework have
a chance to think working or future.
So I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
But I also consider that they should study well.
