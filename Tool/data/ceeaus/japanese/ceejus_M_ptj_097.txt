"I agree with this opinion. There are a lot of reasons why I think so.

I did not have a part-time job until I became a college student. So I was given some money to play with my friends by my parents. However, I work at the restaurant and at the cram school of English. If I work with much trouble and earn money for myself, I realize the importance of money and thank my parents more. I began not to spend too much money.

In the restaurant, I can always learn how to deal with customers. I must keep on being responsible for them there. I am sure that when I graduate from the college and get a job, this experience will help me to survive in society. Also, I can eat dinner or lunch there for nothing after working, so I save a lot of money. I think that this helps the students who live near the college alone especially.  

 In the cram school of English, not only students but also I can study English. I form examinations, so I can also learn how to use the computer. I am sure that what I experience there is also instructive for me.

 As I have described above, from a part-time job, we can learn a lot of things, which we cannot learn in the college. So I think that a college student should have a part-time job.
