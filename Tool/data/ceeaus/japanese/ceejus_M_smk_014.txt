I agree with this idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. There are three reasons why smoking should be forbidden. The first reason is that the smell of smoking can disturb the flavors of dishes. Foods may taste down by that of smoking. The second reason is that family customers can come to restaurants. I think that parents want to prevent their children from smoke. Smoke is too much harmful for what children grow up. So, in front of children, people should not smoke. I think that the last reason is the most important reason. The last reason is smoking does damage to not only the smoking people but also the other people around the smoking people. Surely, there are the spaces which are prohibited smoking at almost all the restaurants in Japan. But the smoke flow widely around the restaurants. There are many people in the restaurants. So, at common place, smoking should be banned. Therefore, I agree with this idea. But I also think that this idea is sorry for the people who like smoking. It seems that they want to smoke after eating. So, I think that restaurant managers had better than to make a space for smoking out of store.
