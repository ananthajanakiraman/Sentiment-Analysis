I disagree with this idea. I donÅft think that itÅfs important for college students to have a part-time job. The main reason is that the most important thing for them is studying hard. I have three ideas to support my opinion.

First, they have to realize how precious college days are. They can freely study what they really want to do only during college students. Before college students, they just did what their teachers forced or recommended them to do. And after their graduation from college, only a few of them will be able to do what they really want to do as their jobs. ThatÅfs way I think that ÅgnowÅh is very precious and that they have to study hard, not work.

Secondly, IÅfve ever seen many bad examples of college students who have a part-time job. Some of them are sleeping even during classes because of tiredness from their jobs. Others often skip classes to go to their jobs. Still others get sick because they are too busy in both studying and working to get enough sleep or rest. They have to make a right decision about their priority, that is to say, they should consider which is more important for them, studying or working.

Thirdly, such bad students as IÅfve mentioned can have a bad influence on other students. For example, some students might skip classes more easily, sometimes without any reasons. And classes, especially group works will not work well because of such students. These examples are only a part of all.

As a result, I insist that college students should put their priority on studying, not working.
