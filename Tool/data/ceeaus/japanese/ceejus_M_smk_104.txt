Smoking tend to be banned everywhere these days, for instance at stations or in taxi. I think it is very good tendency because smoking is too bad not only for smokers themselves but also people around them. I hate smoking and I canÅft understand why they smoke spoiling their health and money. However, I know that there are many people who are crazy about smoking and cannot give up it. If all the restaurants ban smoking, they would never find their comfortable places In Japan. Sometimes it would be their great stress and may lead some crimes. For these reasons, I donÅft completely agree with this idea. However, I think smoking place should be more separated from no smoking place. I work at a restaurant as a waitress. At my restaurant, there are smoking floor and no smoking floor. The first floor is only for no smokers and second floor is only for smokers. I think it is a great system because both of the smokers and no smokers can be very comfortable. Therefore, if there are some attentions that no smokers can be comfortable at restaurants, we donÅft have to completely ban smoking at all the restaurant in Japan.
