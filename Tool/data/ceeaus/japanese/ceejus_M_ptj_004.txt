I agree with the following statement, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are two reasons about my opinion. 
First, I think that it is important to make money for myself. I become college student and I gradually buy many things. So, I need much money but if I donÅft have part-time job, I canÅft buy any things. To buy wanted things, I must have a part-time job. And I think that this my opinion apply many people, so many people need a part-time job. Many students have little money.
Second, part-time job is good experience. This experience is very useful for oneself. For example, teacher for a junior high school student is useful for teaching things. Hall staff is useful for communication with other people. Kitchen staff is useful for cooking. These experiences are important and valuable for college student when one work. If I donÅft experience part-time job, I will be foolish people when I get work. So I want to experience part-time job. This experience is not loss for all the world.
And you can get a close friend in part-time job. I got good friends too. When you make friends, part-time job is joyful!
