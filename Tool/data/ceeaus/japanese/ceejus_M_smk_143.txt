Should smoking be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan? Nowadays, it is the known fact that smoking do harm to our health. Smokers have a higher risk of getting lung cancer than non-smokers. And if expectant mothers smoke, they do harm to the development of their fetuses. Above all, the serious problem to solve is that smokers, with their smoking, do damage not only to the health of themselves but also to that of other people around them, unlike with their taking alcohols. However, we should not ban smoking at all the restaurants. In restaurants, people allow smokers to smoke in particular seats they give smokers. If these seats are apart from the ones non-smokers sit, smokers never do harm to non-smokers in restaurants. Imagine smoking were completely banned at all the restaurants. If so, smokers smoke outside of restaurants and may do harm to non-smokers outside like children or expectant mothers. This is the awful situation. The particular seats for smokers make smokers to forbear their smoking outside. Of course, if, in some restaurants, people who run them have not separated the seats for smokers from the ones for non-smokers yet, they should do it as soon as possible.
