"I agree to this opinion. Some people say that college students have to
study more if they have a time to do a part-time job. Of course, it is
true that there are some students who remain in the same grade by
playing all the time with their earned money. However, there are three
reasons for my opinion. First, having a part-time job tells them a real
society. Most college students have had little time to enter in a
society. By working, they have a chance to know how to communicate with
customers, how to speak formally, and so on. That is a very valuable
experience. Second, they know the importance of money. They have been
brought up preciously by their family, and use their allowance freely.
So, they must know how hard earn money by working themselves. They would
thank for their parents to raise them until now. Finally, they can
challenge various things. Although college students have much free time,
most of them canÅft do what they want to because they donÅft have enough
money. By getting a lot of money, for example, they can watch a baseball
game, go abroad to see a different world, and so on. They could enjoy
their college life very much. Therefore, college students should do a
part-time job. That is useful for their future."
