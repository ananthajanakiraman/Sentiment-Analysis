"In my opinion,I think  that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.There is a some reasons.
You may say that it is not good for students to have a lot of money.However,if they have a lot of money ,their life will be happy and rich.
It leads to reducing the burden of the parent that university students  work part-time.Furthermore,acquaintances open by working part-time and can load society experience more or less.
There will be surely the opinion not to have too much money.But the life that I did not well is necessary,and that therefore students works part-time should be understood to concentrate on study and club activities.That is why I agree to students working part-time."
