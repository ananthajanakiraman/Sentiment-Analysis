I disagree with the opinion that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.

What college students do most is obviously studying.

They go to college in order to push themselves to new heights.

They should acquire much knowledge to prepare for their future jobs and broaden their outlook.

But most of them, including me, have a part-time job and spend their limited time pursuing their temporary pleasure.

They earn money in order to play with friends or buy luxury things.

And actually the more money I earn, the more money I want to get.

For example, I want to go on a trip, buy clothes, and eat delicious foods.

I need more and more money.

Now it is no exaggeration to say that I am obsessed with money.

Then those who work at bars or convenience stores have to work by midnight.

It is terrible for their health.

It may affect their lifestyles as college students.

They tend to skip a meal, lose sleep, or miss lessons.

You may say that not a few students have a part-time job to pay their school fees by themselves or to study abroad.

I think, however, the government helps them by offering scholarships so that they can concentrate on studying.

College students have a lot to learn.

They have no time to have a part-time job.
