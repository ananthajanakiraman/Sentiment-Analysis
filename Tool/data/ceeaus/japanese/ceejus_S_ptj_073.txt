"I think that it  is important for college students to have a part-time job.
We should  experience a lot as social study when we are students.
Especially,communication skills  needed by the social of  future are
important for us. Communicating with various people through part-time
job must acquire these skills and other many important things.
For instance,we can acquire cooking skill when working in
restaurant,skill of explaining things well
 when working as a cram school teacher,and communicating skill in
English working in a shop where foreigner often come like my friend. She
said that she is glad to use English skill she acquire
 as a member of society.
And my friend said that he had never understood importance of working
and importance of his parents until he bigan to work as a part-time job.
I thought so,too.
Then,I think that there are some students who must work to make money
for the costs of study in school and the cost of living like I.  For
example, their family is not wealthy,but they hope to study in
university. They have to make money using the scholarship.
So,I think a part-time job teaches us not being able to learn at
university  but important things  working is important for college
students.
