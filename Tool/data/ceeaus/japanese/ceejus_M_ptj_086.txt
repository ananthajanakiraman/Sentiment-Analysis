I think that it is important for college students to have a part-times job. I have two reasons on my opinion.
 Firstly, we can use money right and left for it is the money we earn by ourselves. Many college students live by their selves. We spend much of money which our parents send us on the lodging charge and the money for food. If we have no money, we can not play with our friends. So if we enjoy campus life, we must earn by ourselves by having a part-times job. We do not always have money we earn by ourselves for playing with friends, by the way. There is another use. We send our parents present on their birthday. They will be pleased at getting such a good present and our sentiment on them.
 Secondly, we can study the society by having a part-times job. Though college students are student, their position is close to person of the society. I think that it is a great experience for those who college students who get out into the world to work in the society. We have opportunity to contact with elderly people when work part-time. Hearing these peopleÅfs talk helps our future life. This may give us valuable things than earning money.
 Therefore I think that it is important for college students to have a part-times job.
