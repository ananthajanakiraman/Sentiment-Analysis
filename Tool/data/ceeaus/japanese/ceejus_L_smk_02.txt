I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. There are two reasons why I think so.
First, tobacco does harm to people and gives people no good. TobaccoÅfs smoke has harmful substance. Sniffing the smoke is taking the substance in our body. It is reported by many doctors that taking the substance in our body join to high risk of lung cancer and second hand smoke has the more substance than main stream smoke. Second hand smoke is smoke from tobaccoÅfs one end which is burning. Main stream smoke is smoke from tobaccoÅfs another end. People who breathe second hand smoke is near smoker. Breathing second hand smoke is passive smoking and breathing main stream smoke is active smoking. In other words, if we mention only one tobacco, risk of lung cancer is higher in passive smoking than in active smoking. That means people who is near smoker has higher expectation of having lung cancer than smoker. It is trouble that be made breathing smoke which he doesnÅft hope and his lung cancer risk becomes higher. User of restaurant is many, so many user gives trouble.
Second reason is that smoke of tobacco smells bad. I think this idea is not minority. The restaurant is place where we eat. When we eat, we enjoy not only taste but also smell. So bad air because of tobacco makes delicious dinner taste bad.
Above two reasons make me think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
