I agree this opinion. This is because, at first, smoking isnÅft good for our health. As we know well, smoking people can catch cancer of lung. Cancer is the most in the cause of death by disease. So, I think itÅfs better not to smoke. Secondary, like restaurant, smoking is annoying to me. Especially, the smog of cigarette ÅeÅfenter,, my body, and it damages my health. 
For example, in my case, only being in the smoking section, the frequency of my coughing becomes pretty high!! And in bad case, I come to have a headache, so I canÅft sleep well at night. (and very sleepy at schoolÅc)
In other words, including some same matters first reason, smoking damages not only people who are smoking, but also people who are around cigarettes, that is, none smoking people like me. So in the place which the window is closed, like restaurant, is easy to damage our body and health.
Recently, what is called ÅeÅewalking cigarette,, is taken in the news program. It also hurts the health of children. So, I am for the opinion. And, I want people who smoke, to pay attention to others around them.
