  
To be sure we get tired of having a part-time job.We are not able to make ourselves at home if we have a part-time job.What is more we may neglect to study in a college.We would mistake the means for the end if we neglect to study in a college.
  But I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.I have three reasons.
  The first reason is that we are able to experience various things by having a part-time job.Those experiences are essential in our lifetime.
Social experiences in a part-time job are useful to a full-time job.  
  The second reason is that we are able to earn a lot of money if we have a part-time job hard.By using a lot of money which we earned we are able to enjoy shopping and our hobby.Moreover we are able to get a sense of accomplishment.
  The third reason is that we are able to make friends with people in workplace.It is important for us to make friends who are not only in a college but also in workplace.
  This is why I agree with a college students' having a part-time job.So I actively want to have a part-time job.
