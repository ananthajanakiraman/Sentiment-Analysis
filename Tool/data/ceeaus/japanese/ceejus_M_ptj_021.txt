  I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Having a part-time job may help students to choose job in the future. And we can meet new colleague, such as college student, elderly people, and high school student.  We can experience some kind of part-time jobs, and learn the difficulty of getting money. In fact IÅfm working at restaurant near Rokkomichi. I have worked there for half a year. It is a first time for me to work. I can know how to service and its difficulty. Sometimes it is hard for me but I enjoy working and servicing. I think it is very important for me to have part-time job. I want to encourage college students who donÅft have part-time job to have it. But we must make much of study, and a part-time job must not prevent us from studying. We should have a part-time job as far as we can. Since I have had my part-time job, I have come to live actively. A part-time job can not only give us money but also give us motivation for our daily life. Having a part-time job is a very valuable experience in college life. So I agree that college students have a part-time job.
