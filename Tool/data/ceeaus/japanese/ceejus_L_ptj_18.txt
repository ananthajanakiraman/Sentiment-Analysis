 I agree this opinion that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are three reasons.

 First reason is that we can experience strictness of the world by working. It is very important. 

 Secondly, having part-time job teaches us the value of money and hardship of our parents. In the case of mine, I worked very hard for a month; however I got no more than fifty thousand yen. I understood difficulty of making money.

 Final reason is that we can get the opportunity of talking many people. All over the world, there are various people who have a different sense of values. So taking such a man spreads our view of the world.

 There may be also persons who say that college studentsÅf main work is study! To be sure, we attend the lecture to learn the expert knowledge. We lose the time for study by working part-time job. 

 However, the thing which is needed is not school career but human nature when we go into the world. I think that a part-time job is very good for training the human nature. Pleasure, club and part-time job are also ÅgstudyÅh.

 For the reasons I agree this opinion.
