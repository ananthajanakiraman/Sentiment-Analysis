Nowadays, too many young people tend to believe that money is made by itself. The spread of illusions that people can spend money and obtain pleasures without works, labors, efforts, the phantoms that stuffs come into existence spontaneously, of course, there is somebody who works for them, but it isnÅft noticed and considered. 
Due to continuing easy life despite the lack of working, they are oblivious of an obvious principal that they have to work for it. The problem is every young man has been raised without understanding the importance of it.
Many people say the duty of students is to study, or to enjoy life at their free will. But there are dangers of this idea. Consequently, they learn that they can enjoy life without working and are good at making others to work. ItÅfs very dangerous because they can grow up to be such people who donÅft like working in spite of being paid enough money. And those ideas will lead to dreams of making a big fortune at one stroke. If they donÅft learn to work, they will be more insincere, lazier and want more convenience. Therefore, there is no liability to let students work, but, we donÅft have to stop them from doing a part-time job.
