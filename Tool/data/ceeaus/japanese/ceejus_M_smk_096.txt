I agree with this statement. Smoking harms our health. If smokers are
harmed their health by smoking, it is their own responsibility. But
people who are near smokers are also harmed their health. It is very
important thing. Almost all the restaurants in Japan have smoking area.
When we enter a restaurant, a clerk of the shop says ÅgDo you smoke?Åh Of
course, our university has smoking area and non smoking. So, some
smokers say itÅfs O.K. But, I think smoking area is near non smoking
area. It is meaningless. I have an experience. I went to a restaurant
with my friend. Of course, we donÅft smoke. So, we sat down non smoking
seat. However, there is smoking seat behind us. And, people sat the seat
began to smoke. It is not strange thing. But for non smokers, smoking is
very, very bad thing. We couldnÅft enjoy eating. Therefore, it is
important to separate each area. For example, smoking is prohibited all
the platforms of station except smoking area. This area is the edge of
platform or room. But the restaurants donÅft have so large place. So it
is difficult to make smoking area like station. Therefore, I agree with
statement. Probably, some smokers say ÅgWe have a right to enjoy
smoking!Åh But, I want them to think about non smoking people. And, I
want to say them to stop smoking only at the table.
