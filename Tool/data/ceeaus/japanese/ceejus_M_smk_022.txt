Recently, in Japan many people got to know the risk and unnecessariness of smoking in society. Thus, I think it is necessary to ban from smoking at all the restaurants in Japan. There are three reasons why I think so. Firstly, smell of dishes-sweet smell, sour smell and so on- is very important in restaurants. And the cigarette spoils a smell of the cooking. It is true that there is some person who wants to smoke while 	eating a dish or drinking liquor, but the smoking should be prohibited at the restaurant if we think about many other people. Secondly, the smoke of the cigarette may spoil equipment: for example, wallpaper or ornament in the restaurant. It is very wasteful if these things are very precious valuable things. Thirdly, the prohibition of smoking is a flow of the modern society. It becomes natural on a train and the platform. Or there are many places that you cannot smoke in the workplace. So it is thought that it is a matter of course to prohibit smoking at a restaurant. In conclusion, the smoking should be banned in all Japanese restaurants
