"I agree with this opinion. You may say that college students should study hard so that they 
can play active in society,but it is not correct. 
 I support this opinion with three opinions. First of all, they are able to make many friend
s. There are the younger generation and the middle generation and the older generation in wo
rkplace. Students may learn many things from working or communicationing or spending with mi
ddle or older genaration who live longer than them. Second, they learn the importance of mon
ey. You may understand that, we realize the importance of thing or how hard it is when we ex
perience it. In my experience, when I started to work a part time that I earn 800 yen per an
 hour, I can't buy things  which cost me over 800 yen easily.Third, my last opinion, they ca
n earn money. How to use it is vaviey, for example,school fee,money for food,money for club 
activity,and others.One of these is money for travel abroad,now I save my money for this.I h
ave been abroad for only once.It happened when I was three and hardly remmember.But,accordin
g to friends,teachers,and books,it is so great. when college students look at many things in
 abroad countries,they look at things with new eyes.
Conclusingly,college students should work for a part time job and earn money,of course.I thi
nk that these experience may help them in their future.("
