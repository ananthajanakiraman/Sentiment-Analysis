"I think part time job is not important for college student. Because they
can study only while they are student, so they should spent their time for
their study. 
When they are student, they feel lecture is boring and not interesting. But
they understand they waste their precious time after they graduate college
and have to take a job. My parents often say that you have to study hard
while you can study. And they say we don
Åft save their money for your study, so you donÅft have to do part time
job.
I canÅft still understand importance of lecture. In the future lecture may
help me. When I was little, I take many lessons. Piano, basketball,
swimming, writing, English and so on. I don
Åft like those at that time. But now I think they are useful. For example,
thanks to basketball and swimming, I can get strength. Thanks to piano, I
can read music. As long as those, lecture may help me in future.
They do part time job for many reasons. Some of them have to part time job
for their life. I am happy because I don
Åft have to do part time job for my life. So I canÅft say college student
should not do part time job. But college student should keep their mind
that they spent their precious time on part time job.
