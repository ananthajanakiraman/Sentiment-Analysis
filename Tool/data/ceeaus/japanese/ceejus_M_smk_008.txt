 I agree with this statement. I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I have mainly two reasons and, then, I will mention why I agree.
 First, a lot of people who do not smoke often hate a smoke of cigarettes. At the restaurants, they have the rights of enjoying eating, and if someone is smoking near them they can not enjoy it. Since the restaurants are public place, it should be kept comfortable for everyone. Smoking sometimes makes people uncomfortable, so smoking should be banned at the public place like the restaurants.
 Second, a smoke of cigarettes affects not only the feelings of people who do not like smoking but also the health of everyone. If you smoke, of course it is bad for your health. In addition, it is worse for the health of people who sitting near you or serving the dishes to you. It is proved scientifically that people not who smoking but who is near smoking man are more affected in the point of the health. So smoking should be banned in order to protect the customers and the employees of that restaurant from harm of the cigaretteÅfs smoke.
 That is my ideas about smoking. Of course it is better that they can stop smoking by themselves at the restaurants but it is difficult, I think. So smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. The restaurants should be comfortable place for everyone.
