I think university students should have a part-time job. For one reason, a lot of students are live a single life, but there were few students who are given enough money to live by their parents. 
 University students have a lot of time than working members of society, and have freedom to think or act like they want to than high school students. But in fact, we canÅft live like this because we donÅft have enough money.
 For example, IÅfm here in Kobe University, and I live alone. At first, my family thought that I could get a scholarship, but maybe I canÅft. (The result of the discussion is not announced yet.) 
 In addition, if we belong to some club activity, we need a lot of money for it. I belong to Ågk-on-ROCKÅh. In this club, we can play a variety of music. To play music in a band, I have to buy a guitar, effecter, a tuner, and so on. These are too expensive for us to buy without a part-time job. If we want to live a full life in campus, we need money!
 
 Moreover, we can learn the hardship of making money by working, and we can feel a sense of fulfillment.
In fact, I got my first salary in my life two days ago, and I feel so happy!!

 These are the reasons why I think university students should have a part-time job.
