  I think smoking should be completely banned at all public places such as a restaurant, station, theater and college because cigarette smoke includes poison which is dangerous for peopleÅfs health. And the people near smokers are also harmed by the poison of the cigarette smoke. I think there are three important things when the smoking problems are discussed.

 

First, passive smoking has bad influence on our health. Moreover, itÅfs more dangerous than smoking directly. Smokers might be prepared for the bad smoking influence and give up the idea of keeping their health. But passive smokers never think so. Most of them probably want to keep their health and enjoy their life for a long time. If a woman is pregnant, she should not smoke without question. And the people near her should pay attention to the situation of smoking. It is also dangerous for a baby to breath in the cigarette smoke.

 

Second, habitual smoking needs a lot of money. So stopping smoking will solve the problem of a family budget. Now, the government in Japan plans a large increase in some kinds of taxes. If habitual smoking is improved, we might overcome such severe situation of a family budget. I think that stopping smoking is to family advantage.

 

 Third, heavy smokers, the people who smoke a lot every day, always have the risk of lung cancer. I have seen the picture of a lung suffered from nicotine. It showed that the lug turned from vivid pink to black by the influence of nicotine. The picture really shocked me. So, I donÅft smoke now and wonÅft do in the future.

 

 After all, it doesnÅft profit us to smoke. Smoking harms both smokers and nonsmokers seriously. That is why smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants.
