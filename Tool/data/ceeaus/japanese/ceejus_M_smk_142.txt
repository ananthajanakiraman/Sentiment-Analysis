Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. This is because I have several reasons. 
The first reason is that smoking is not good for smokers. The data shows that more and more smokers are killed by the lung cancer because of smoking. In fact, my friendÅfs uncle was smoking heavily. He was smoking about thirty cigarettes a day. As the result, he was killed by a lung cancer when he was forty years old.
The second reason is that smoking is not also good for people around smokers. I know that smoke out of the smokers is much worse for health than smoke smoked by the smokers.
The final reason is the most important. For instance, a family was looking forward to eating out at a rich and famous restaurant. The family was not so rich that they could eat out at such a rich and famous restaurant only once a year. At last, the day when they eat out came. They sat down at each seat. The dishes were put on the table in front of them. They began to eat. However, they smelt cigarette. The family looked around them. The visitors around them were smoking. How sad this situation is!
This is why smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
