I agree to this opinion because college students have to learn the knowledge to live on their own. I think that having a part-time job is one of the best way to adapt to the adult society. Of course,it is important for college students to study hard at the college but I believe that this four years are very precious days for"marginal man." We can spend this time as we like. We are able to make time to study or work or play at will.When I was a high school student,my teacher told that he felt regret having played day after day when he was a college student. So,he taught me to study hard. Then,I decided that I try to study very hard but now I think that I have free time to do something except studying. Playing is joyful but only playing does not bring good changes.On the other hand,I really appreciate what my boss parents have done for me.Since I have started living alone, I always feel difficulties to live by myself.Therefore I think that I had better have a part-time job to help my parents and to get out into the world.Also working enable us to have a lot of friends and to discovery our unlimited possibilities.So I think having a part-time job is important for college students.
