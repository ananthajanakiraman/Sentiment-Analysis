I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Part-time job gives us not only some money but also very precious experience for our future. I have worked at a SUSHI shop for 4 years. Tasks teach me a lot of things. For example, I learned manner to superiors and customers. It is so useful when I get a job. And I got good relationship with coworkers in the shop. I always enjoy talking with them after working. There is much kind of people (such as high school student, college student, housewife and so on) in my shop, so I can listen to various stories from them. Their stories are to my benefit. We canÅft get these things in the school. I could change myself from myself before the part-time job was started. But if I take a lot of time for the part-time job, I am not able to study regularly. However, part-time job is very important; the most important thing is studying for us. I will keep working part-time job until I graduate from my university, but I will take care the way of using the time. I want to cope with both study and part-time job.
