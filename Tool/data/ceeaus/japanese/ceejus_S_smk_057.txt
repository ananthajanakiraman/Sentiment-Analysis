Smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  Because smoking provides smokers with felling at ease even if they break themselves by smoking and no one cannot rob them of the ease. They may think smoking is of course harmful but gives good effects to relax. And of course we must consider people who hate smoking or cannot accept smoking in order to protect their health. They may not want to smoke even passively and smoking is solved by stopping smoking. They recommend stopping smoking because it is good for health. In short, both of them have very different policies which are thought right by both sides and smokers will not accept a ban of smoking or non-smokers will not accept smoking. So I suggest that we should completely separate smokers from non-smokers at all the restaurants in Japan. If we do so, Smokers will be able to smoke and get some pleasure and non-smokers will not have to put up with other peopleÅfs smoking. From a point of view of health, smoking should be banned, but from a point of view of relax, it cannot deny that smoking is one of the best thing for some people. So smoking should not completely be banned like my opinion.
