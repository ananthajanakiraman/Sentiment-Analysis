I think that they forbit our smoking in restaurants. I have three reasons. Firstly, smoking is not healthy. It is known that one cigarettes shortens our life seven minutes.Å@A fact that the smoke of cigarettes injure our health is proved scientifically with today's medicine. Smokes don't stay outdoors. But, smoke is filled indoors such as in restaurants. So, it makes people do'nt want to smoke smoke. A number of people donÅft like smoke of cigarettes. So, in restaurants, a lot of people dislike smoke of cigarettes too.   It is hated by many people who don't want to smoke. It is not good fact morally. Secondly, cooks want us to enjoy their cooking with all of our senses. We enjoy cooks with firstly eye, secondly noses, thirdly touch, fourthly tongue, finally ears. If it smelled smoke of cigarettes in restaurantsÅAthe good smells of cooking is made by cooks is spoiled. Thirdly we should enjoy not cigarette but tasting delicious cooking or funny conversations with friends or family. Their smoking time prevents us from enjoying those pleasure. When we were in restaurants, we had better enjoy the atmosphere in restaurants as much as we can.And so, I think they should not smoke in restaurants
