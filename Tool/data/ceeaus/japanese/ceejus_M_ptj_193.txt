I think part-time job is very important for college students.
I have mainly two reasons to support the idea.
First, we need money to enjoy college life, but it is no good to rely on our
 parents. College students are enough to earn money at least for playing. I 
belong to wind orchestra club, and I need about 1 million yen in 4 years, fo
r dinner with our juniors, maintenance of music instruments and so on! I donÅf
t want to ask my parents to help me.
Second, part-time job is good experience for people who work as employees
in the future. I work in a convenience store now. When I began to work
there, I was often by owner because I was so nervous that I made a lot of
mistakes. However, now I got used to the job and became able to do what I
have to do as fast as possible. I met many people and learned a lot from
them. For example, I learned pleasure of communication with guests and a
sense of responsibility. Perhaps people who have never done part-time job
have large troubles when they find employment in the future.
Therefore, I think college students should do part time jobs to raise
themselves.
