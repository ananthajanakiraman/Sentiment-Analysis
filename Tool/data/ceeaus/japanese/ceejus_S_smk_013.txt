   I agree that smoking should be completely banned at the all restaurant. Why do I think so? Because I do not like the smell of cigar smoke. And when I eat something at the restaurant, if there are smoking people near my seat, I feel unfortunate and displeasure. When I eat something, if the smokes of someone are blown, I feel annoying. I think that everyone feel displeasure in such situation. When I go restaurant with my family, my father smokes cigarettes. My mother and I feel uncomfortable. So I think Japanese restaurant owner should make restaurants where only smokers can enter. If there are people who do not like the smell and smoke of cigar, they can not enter the restaurant. By doing so, people who do not like cigarette feel good at the other restaurant. And smokers do not have to care about non smokers. Therefore I think smoking should not have to be completely banned at the all restaurant. I suggest that owner or manager of the restaurant should make ÅgSmokerÅfs restaurantÅh.
