Today, the Japanese government is seriously considering that it is going to establish the new law determining that the price of a pack of cigarette is a thousand yen. And, I really agree to it. This is because I do not like the smell of the smoke of cigarette, and I think the law makes the number of smoker smaller. In fact, however, it goes without saying that a large number of people love smoking and smoke everyday, and cigarette is indispensable for them. And, we have to accept the fact that we can not regulate cigarette strictly. If all the restaurants in Japan start to ban smoking there, in which not all people are able to have a good time, and some people feel like going out sooner. Thus, it is likely that the number of people who go to restaurants will decrease gradually. Of course, this situation is not good for restaurants at all. So, I think all we have to do is to separate the room into two areas, smoking area and no smoking area, though this has already been in effect at almost all restaurants. In addition to this, smokers should keep the manner of smoking. And by doing so, no problem should happen.
