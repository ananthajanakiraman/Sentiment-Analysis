First of all, I agree this statement, namely I think it is important for us to have a part-time job. There are three reasons why I think so. Firstly, a part-time job is a chance to get money that I can use freely. Now, I live in Rokko by myself and my parents send regular money to me once a month. I spend that money in living. The rest of that money is not so much. So I do not buy anything I like anytime. In short, we college students need money. Secondly, to do a part-time job is to join in a part of society indirectly, I think. When we graduate from this university after few years, we have to work in a complex society. Then, the more we have experience in a part-time job, the better we are. Thirdly, to do a part-time job is to get a chance making friends with. It is easy to making friends with by working together. In conclusion, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
