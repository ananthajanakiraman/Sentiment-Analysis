I think that to have a part-time job for college students is valuable.

I never worked as a part-time job since I entered Kobe University.

I began a part-time job at Hokkahokatei 5 months ago, I worked very hard.

I learned a lot of things there , for example, greetings. I have never known

that when I enter working place I should say ÅgOhayougozaimasuÅh.

And I learned communications are very important , I had a lot of trouble

for the first time because learning a work was hard and I didnÅft familiar

there worker. But I came to work smoothly for 2 months because 

I got well with them. I had a lot of communication them, so ,

I got used to work. And another thing which I learned is that

earning money is very hard. If I work 3 for a week , I can earn about 

40000 yen for a month. Of course it is very hard. But, I want a lot of

things ,clothes, shoes, games, bags, wallet, big sofa bed and so on.

And I need money for food and association, for example, karaoke, boring

,tennis clubÅc  I Åem running short of money every day ,so , I have to work.

But I think that too working is a waste of times because I think that

while campus life we can do anything which we want to do.
