I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Because I think that it is valuable for college students to have independence at a college. There is a person to live alone in a college student. And friends increase at a college, too. So money is very important. And I take part in club activities. Club activities and group activities need much money because a camp for training and game and so on.
 But , on the other hand , there is a person to say to study in a college. So they say that a part-time job is obstacle to study. But I think that a part-time job is to study society. It is important for a person who goes out to society to study society. A part-time job may different to work at society. But I think that to work can learn a sense of responsibility.
What I say first is that it is valuable for college students to have independence at a college. At a college , a college student is not only studying knowledge , but also need to experience society. So I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
