 Recently, smoking has been banned at many places such as planes, buses, trains and so on. That is because smoking troubles many people.  Tobacco has many toxic chemicals. Smokers sometimes suffer from serious diseases, such as lung cancer. Besides, smoking does harm not only to smokers but also to non-smokers. Non-smokers can breathe smoke and fall sick if they are near smokers. It is called passive smoking. Some non-smokers will know this and hate tobacco. Especially, in the restaurant, many people will enjoy eating and talking with friends or families. If some people smoke, the restaurant is filled with smoke and people feel unpleasant. Then, they can no longer enjoy talking and taste dishes. It is very unhappy. Restaurant is the place where many people relax and enjoy dining. Customers go to restaurant for the purpose of it. They should not be offended by smoking. Smoking should be strictly banned at the restaurant.  However, some non-smokers may argue that they cannot enjoy eating in the restaurant if smoking is banned there. But restaurant is the special places. Smokers can smoke in private places, such as their home but customers can enjoy eating better than usual only at the restaurant. Non-smokers should be respected.
