 In the world, the number of smokers tends to decrease. But 
there are still people who do not try to stop smoking. ÅgThe
 world tends to stop smoking now. However I do not knock off
 smoking. It is a preference.Åh I do not deny these words. A
nd I do not worry whether the number of smokers decreases or
 do not decrease so much. However, I think that it is necess
ary to limit the place in which it smokes if it is considere
d that the smoke of the cigarette is bad for not only smoker
Åfs body but also nonsmoker's body. In addition, I think tha
t the smell of the smoke ruins the taste of the dish and the
 smoking with the table is against the manner. It is the sam
e also when we drink. I might say an inelegant thing. But, a
s a matter of fact, only a smoking person is good feelings. 
Moreover, there is a no-smoking zone in restaurants. However
, some restaurants are too narrow and there is no meaning th
at divides the seats according to the restaurant. 
 I want smoking people not to smoke independently when eatin
g, and it will not be achieved. So I think smoking should be
 completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
