"I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time
job. There are three main reasons. The first reason is that many college
students live by themselves. They come from all over Japan and some of
them become independent of their parents in money. They have a lot of
things to pay, so they need to work in order to make their living cost.
Besides, they need much money in particular, because new college
students must buy new textbook.
 The second reason is that college students can learn the social system
if they start to have a part-time job. A part-time job is probably the
first job for much of them, so they should have strong sense of
responsibility. And they understand the value of money and find
themselves one of the members of society.
 The third reason is that college students have much time. After school,
they have free time, for example some people do their club activities,
other people study hard. They should try to challenge what they want to
do, and they had better undergo various experiences in their school days.
 In conclusion, I think that a part-time job is important for college
students.
