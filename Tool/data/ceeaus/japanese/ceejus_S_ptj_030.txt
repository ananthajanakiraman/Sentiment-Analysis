Although some people say that students should not work, I think that we, the students of universities should work for ourselves.
The first reason is why we can spend the money we earn on something we really want to do.
If we can save money we earn, we can go shopping, watch the movies and travel with friends or families.
Particularly Traveling abroad in our vacation is very interesting because we canÅft have   much chance after entering the companies.
Moreover, I think it is very important that we decide the aim like this for working and try working hard.
When we have some aim, we can hope our life.
Until now we have been given money from our parents even if we only go to the universities but some years later when we graduate from the university, we should work and eventually support them.
So we should prepare for working after graduating the universities by experiencing as many jobs as we can. 
I think various works as students shows us how to deal with difficult problem, and how to express ourselves in the working places.  
This is the second reason. 
Therefore I agree that students of the universities should work.
