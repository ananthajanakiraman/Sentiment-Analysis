Nowadays in Japan people tend to dislike the tobacco. There are a bunch of places where smoking is prohibited. For instance in hotels, on streets, at colleges and not only in trains but also on platform. So only at restaurants smoking is not banned that is strange. Smoking should be thoroughly forbidden at all the restaurants.

One of the reasons is that if many smoking people are in the restaurants, we would feel its atmosphere to be not good. A restaurant is a place where we have a good meal and where we spend time comfortably. Secondly some of customers who come to the restaurants are family. Sometimes the family has the babies. To babies tobaccoÅfs smoke is very bad. The restaurants should make visiting all families very happy. So smoking ought not to be allowed.

Nowadays the rules of Japan gradually begin to be rigid. But they are not stricter than the rules of Singapore, America, United Kingdom and France. There smoking is almost prohibited. For instance if we are in one of the countries, it is natural that we donÅft watch a TV commercial. And if we walk there, we would donÅft look the advertisements on streets. Japan should imitate these.
