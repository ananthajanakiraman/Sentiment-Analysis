In my opinion, It is not important for college student to do a part time job.
However, you should do a part time job. 
To do a part time job waste your time and energy. After work, you can get some money. This money mostly use for play, for example, go shopping, watch movie, and going karaoke. They are all time waster. So part time job prevent you to study.
Part time job has some faults, but it has also some advantage.
First, you can develop your ability in your part time work. For example, if you want to be a teacher, you can learn how to teach in clam school in your part time job. In this case part time job helps to study.
Second, when you were high school student, you have a strong relationship with their family, but now some of you live alone, some of you have weaker relationship with family then before. And in my opinion, a relationship with college friend is weaker than it was in highschool. But you do a part time job,
You can make another friends. If you fail to make friend and troubled to your
work ,you can leave it and start another job.
