"I think it is good for college students to have a part-time job.There
are three reasons for this.
First,it allows them to earn money and enables them to engage in various
activities.May tenth,I had a part-time job for the first time.I did a
concert staff.I felt it was very hard.However,I learn a lot of things
which I canÅft learn in the class.For example,I learn it difficult to
earn money.I think students should develop their potential by taking
part in as many activities as possible.Their potential will help them
whatever you do.
Second,a part- time job gives students an opportunity to learn about the
real world.
We have been studying various subjects at school.However,we are not able
to learn about real world only at school.So,we should have a part-time
job to broaden our view of life.
Third,a part time job gives students some stories which they talk about.
When you talk with someone who you meet for the first time,you can talk
an interesting story about part-time jobs.You can make friend with many
people.
So,having a part-time job is a good way to develop ourselves.I want to
do several part-time jobs and develop my potential.Of course,I want to
get money too.   "
