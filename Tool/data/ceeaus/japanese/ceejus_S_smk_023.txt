I think that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. It is because many of nonsmoking people feel the pain when they take smoke of smoking people. And smoking is toxic for the health. If people think they live long, they should not smoke. Smoking people will get cancer because of nicotine and tar which are included in tobacco. And smoke which smoking people give off is more toxic for non smoking people than smoking people. Then smoking people should smoke at space, in which smoking is allowed. Many of my friends are smoker and smoke everywhere but when I frown about it, they stop smoking. Then I think people must note the public manner and each person should be considerate to each person. If they were ignored, each would feel uncomfortable. Smoking people mind the frown of nonsmoking people and nonsmoking people feel pain about smoking. Finally, consideration for each side is most important about this theme.
