"I agree with the statement. I think that it is important for college students
 to have a part-time job. And, maybe I am going to have a part-time job soon. 
I am going to explain why I agree with it by three reasons.
 First, almost all of the college students have little money. They want to buy
 a lot of clothes, video games, books,and so on and play with their friends. B
ut they do all of what they want, their wallet will be empty as soon as they d
o.  So they need money every time.
 Second, college students have a lot of free time. They have no classes on Sat
urday and Sunday, and they have very long vacation in summer and spring. I thi
nk that it is impossible to spend all of the free time for playing. They shoul
d not spoil the free time.
 Third, part-time job is studying about earning. Young people have little idea
 about society, especially job. But, their fathers (or their parents) are earn
ing for them. They should know how difficult to earn 1 yen, and appreciate the
ir parents. If students have a part-time job, they will not waste any money. 
 So I agree with the statement. If you are a college student and don't have a 
part-time job, you should have it as soon as you can.
