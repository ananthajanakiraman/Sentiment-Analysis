Å@ I agree with this opinion. There is one reason.

      We should think that restaurants are the place where we eat foods with our family or friends talking with pleasantly over once more. Also all of us should want to eat foods which are delicious. But we canÅft eat the foods by allowing smokers to smoke in restaurants. For example, when I eat the foods with my family pleasantly and the smoke comes, I wonÅft eat pleasantly by the delicious smell was drowned out by the smell of smoke. Actually I experienced the situation like this. When I entered one restaurant with my family, there were only seats in the smoking section. We were forced to sit down seats in the smoking section because there were few times when we looked for another restaurant. Foods had brought. Then the guests who sat around us hadnÅft smoked yet.  When a few minutes had passed, some of them started to smoke. Just then, I smelled the disagreeable odor of the smoke in spite of that I ate delicious foods. And my parents felt loathing for the odor. After that we couldnÅft eat pleasantly and with good taste. I think there are lots people who have ever experienced like this.

     In conclusion, I think as long as restaurants are the place where we eat foods pleasantly with good taste, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
