"I agree with the idea.

 

It is because that working at part time job is very good chance to learn a lot of things.

For example how to communicate with people at official situation and how hard to get money is.

 

Although there are many people who disagree with it because working at cram school or home teacher is too high wage for college or university student, I donÅft think so.

There are two reasons.

At first, working at these jobs will be very good and rare chances to learn how to teach or tell other people what they want to teach or tell.

Next, I think that too high wage is not totally wage but hourly wage.

Generally speaking, because college or university student have to attend a lot of class, they donÅft have much time for part time job.

And they need so much money to play with their friends or to buy clothes.

Especially, students who live alone have to get a lot of money to pay fee for house, energy, gas, and so on.

Even though they do high hourly wage jobs, their totally wage will fit their life style.

 

College or university students are likely to have more time when they are free for classes than high school students.

They shouldnÅft use the time to do nothing or sleep but also should use it very effectively.

It usually means to do part time job or to study.

So they should study in college or university and do part time job out of there.
