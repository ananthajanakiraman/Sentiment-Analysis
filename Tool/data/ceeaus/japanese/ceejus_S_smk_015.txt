I agree with this statement. Because I dislike tobacco very much personally! Although my personal opinion apart, there are lots of people who are poor at the smoke of tobacco. For them, it is hard that being smoked in a side more than a smoker considers. From the beginning, there are many arguments for and against smoking. Of course, I also understand that it is difficult to forbid smoking extensively legally now and that a smoker cannot part with tobacco easily so. However, passive smokers are injured their health than active smokers because the smoke that smokers exhaled includes a lot of harm. I cannot allow this fact. So I want smokers to try keeping off smoking in public places for non-smoking persons. 
 Come to the point, restaurants are places to enjoy eating. I think that restaurants should be places which everybody can use comfortably. If someone smokes while person poor at the tobacco enjoy eating, how does he feel? Probably he will not be able to go on enjoying eating. I actually have found situations like this many times when I worked part-time in Italian restaurant. The restaurant which I was working had not divided the place into smoking and non-smoking sections. Therefore, there were visitors who wear the face which seems to be unpleasant by the smoke of the tobacco from the next table. I felt bad seeing cases like this. Although I understand that it is impossible to impose a duty of prohibition of smoking in all public places, I would like to define prohibition of smoking at restaurants at least so that everybody can enjoy eating pleasantly.
