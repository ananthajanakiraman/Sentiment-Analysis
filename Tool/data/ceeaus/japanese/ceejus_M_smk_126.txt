Smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan, because some people dislike smoke, other people feel irritate without smoking.  

Smoke have a bad effect on people , especially pregnant women ,patients and so on. Non smokers are reluctant to have a dinner near to smokers. In fact, I dislike smoke very much, and I stop breathing ,when I am near to smoker. 

On the other hand ,cigarette is a necessity for smokers. If they do not smoke for a long time, they will feel irritate, and they may become in a bad temper. They may not have a delicious meal due to not smoking.

 

the owner of the restaurants should separate smoking area from non smoking area.  The separation is distinct ,for instance smoking area and non smoking area is separated by wall and door. So, the smell of cigarette do not reach non smokers  and they need not worry to secondhand smoking. So, whether people smoke or not , they can comfortably have a dish and have a good time at restaurants.

 

Thus smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants but be allowed only at smoking space. Non smoker should also admit the space.
