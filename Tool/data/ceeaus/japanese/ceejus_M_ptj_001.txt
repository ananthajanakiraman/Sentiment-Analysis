I think it is important for collage students to have a part-time job.
  I am twenty years old. Many people of the same age as me work and earn salary or keep house. Some of them even have their children and take care of them. However, I live by using money my father earns and by eating what my mother cooks, so I think I should make my allowance at least.
 When I was a high school student, I belonged to Wander Vogel club.  The club camps all over Japan, so I needed much money.  Because I wanted to make money for it by myself, I decided to have a part-time job. I was busy because I should study hard too. I wanted to leave it whenever I was told off. But the experience taught me how severe working is and grew up me very much.
 Now, I teach junior high school and high school students in their home. Some of them donÅft do homework or donÅft understand what I say. It bothers me, but I enjoy my job thinking how to teach or how to keep their motivation, and I want to keep this job.
 I think to have a part-time job has mean more than earn money.
