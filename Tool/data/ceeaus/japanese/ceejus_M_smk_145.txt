Å@I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in
 
Japan.  Restaurant is a public space.  So, in a restaurant there are a lot of 
 
people including nonsmokers.  If a man smokes in a restaurant , that smoke 
 
will immediately spread there because a restaurant is usually not so large. 
 
Then, that smoker may feel comfortable, but most of nonsmokers will feel 
 
bad.  Some people who dislike the smell of smoke may lose their appetite. 
 
In Japan, the number of nonsmokers is larger than that of smokers.  So, 
 
considering the public benefit, smoking should be completely banned at all 
 
the restaurants in Japan. 
 
   In some restaurants, smokerÅfs space is divided from nonsmokerÅfs.  
 
Recently, this system have been introduced in a lot of restaurants and coffee 
 
shops.  But, smokerÅfs space is not completely separated from nonsmokerÅfs.  
 
So, nonsmokers breathe the smoke unless smokers stop smoking there.      
 
In addition, scientists say that passive smoking have a bad influence on 
 
nonsmokers.  Smoke in passive smoking contains a lot of poisonous 
 
substances.  If a nonsmoker stays by a smoker, the risk that nonsmoker 
 
will have a cancer will increase.  In order not to damage nonsmokerÅfs 
 
health, I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the 
 
restaurants in Japan.
