I agree with the following statement ÅeÅfIt is important for college students to have a part-time job.ÅfÅf  I have some reasons why I agree with this statement. First of all, to have a part-time job teaches us the real value and importance of money. Before I started a part-time job, I got some money off my mother and my ground mother. And I bought books and clothes I wanted with the money. Then I sometimes bought something I didnÅft really need. But after I started a part-time job, I came to buy something I really needed carefully. For I learned how hard earning money was. I felt the money I earned by myself was very valuable. Secondly, to have a part-time job gives me a lot of experiences. I work as a part-time teacher. And I teach not only junior high school students but also primary school and high school students. Other part-time teachers are many kinds of peoples. They are college students, women who have children and men who got married. Therefore I communicate with many kinds of people. And I learn wide views from them because they have their own views different from mine. Thirdly to have a part-time job improve the way how to use limited times. I must do many thing-studying, listening to rock music, reading books, housekeeping, communicating with my family, and a part time job. So I came to plan by myself. And I always do something I must do now. For these reasons I agree with the following statement ÅeÅfIt is important for college students to have a part-time job.ÅfÅf And IÅfll have many kinds of part-time jobs from now on.
