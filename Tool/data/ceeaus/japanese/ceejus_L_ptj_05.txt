I agree with the statement. So I have a part-time job in a cake shop since last September.
 First, college students need some money. In my case, my parents give some money to me. But I need more money than that because I want to go shopping, eat nice food, and travel.
 Second, we can have important experience at a part-time job. Through this experience, I notice that it is very hard to earn money. So I want to thank my parents. In addition to that, I can learn good manners. For example, I learn how to use polite words and how to give good service.
 Finally, I can meet many people. There, I meet same college students, different college students, and people who make cakes. I canÅft meet them in my daily life. I talk to them and I can learn many things. One day, I talked with a man who makes cakes. He is nineteen years old and I am also nineteen years old. I asked him about his work. He answered that it was very hard but he liked the work. And he talked about his dream. He said that he wanted to have his own shop in the future, so he worked hard. I thought his life was very different from my life but I wanted to do work like him in the future.
