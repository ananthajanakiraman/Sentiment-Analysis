I agree to the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all
the restaurants in Japan. There are a lot of restaurants that have the
seats for smokers and the seats for nonsmokers. But on the seats for
nonsmokers, cigarette smoke come from seats for smokers. And the smell
of tobacco smoke sticks to our clothes. We are displeased. And because
of the smell of tobacco, my appetite often falls off. Restaurant is the
place for people who want to eat something, not for people who want to
smoke. The most reason that I agree to the opinion is that cigarette
smoke is bad for our health. Cigarette smoke contains tar, CO and so on.
They are bad for our health. Tar causes cancer. And because of CO, a
blood vessel becomes thin. Of course, they hurt smokers. But they hurt
nonsmokers, too. That is passive smoking. In other words, a nonsmoker
absorbs cigarette smoke that a smoker released. Can the smoker bear the
responsibility if nonsmoker gets cancer? I think they canÅft. So I think
smokers who smoke next to a nonsmoker easily lack of a sense of
responsibility. Because of these things, I agree to the opinion that
smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
