"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
  First, after graduating school, college students will work for their companies. So I think that they should learn how hard it is to work as a member of society. Now, I am working at gas station. The job is not light work. I have to achieve sales aim. To achieve sales aim, I have to sell engine oil, batteries, wipers, and more. It is not easy for me to do that. But when I start to work at company after graduating school, I will have to do more hard work. So I want to be used to these hardships. If I would not work at gas station, I am not able to spend such valuable time.
 Second, I think that college students have to earn their living costs by their own. College students comparatively have many free times. So I think that they have enough time to work. In fact, I am belonging to music club and I have to practice the guitar, but I can have time to work and can earn my living cost. My friends also try to have time to work and they can do that. If I would not have a part-time job, I spend idle hours in my free time. I feel I am spending precious time when I work at gas station.
 A part-time job is not easy, but we can feel fulfillment. So I think it is important to have a part-time job.
