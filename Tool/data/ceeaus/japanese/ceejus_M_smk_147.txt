I am for the idea.There are some reasons.First,I hate smoke,especially
while I am eating.With smell of smoke,any food become the worst of all
foods.If smoke with a long distance,smoke flows to my place and if it is
a little,it will make me feel sick.Second,a lot of people donÅft like
smoke.It is obvious ,as see the govementÅfs movement,for
instance,decreasing smoking area,arising price of tabacoÅc.Somokers may
say that Ågif you donÅft like smoke,you should sit non-smoking seat.ÅhI can
understand what he want to say,but,speaking,as a worker in a
restaurant,not all restaurants separate smoking seat and non-smoking
seat.Even if separated,it is unclear.When many non-smoking customers
come to a restaurant,and non-smoking seats are filled,clerks would take
customers to smoking seat.So,without banning smoking,all customers are
possible to smell smoke.Third,smoke is bad for both smoker and people
around him.Generally,who agrees the idea is the later,but,for the
smorker ,the idea isnÅft bad.Now,banning smoking is the trend.In my
opinion,sooner or later,the day when it is hard to smoke will
come.Then,smoker had better agree the idea and decreases opportunities
to smoke.It takes a lot of time to give up smoking.Then,do such things
and stop smoking before many difficulties confront you,it is the wise
celection,isnÅft it?
