I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.

In addition, I want that smoking should be banned at university.

I donÅft smoke, so I donÅft like smells of smoke. And I dislike that my clothes smell

like smoke. My mother hates smoke too. My father used to smoke before I born, but

she made him give up smoking. Because, smoke gives a bad influence to health.

Since I heard that, I made up my mind to never smoke. Smoke courses cancer.

Especially lung cancer, and more lots of cancer. If I smoke every day, I will die 

due to cancer. But it can be avoided very easily, all of thing that I have to do is

never smoking. I have friends who smoke, and they say that smoking is very

comfortable, how about smoking little? But, I always remember my motherÅfs talk 

and I reject. Sometimes I become to want to smoke, such a time I think that talk.

Smoking doesnÅft have a bad influence only smoking people. They influence others.

I think that smoking person will be bad is of course. But I canÅft allow that not 

smoking person gets bad. I often see smoking people in university, and that smell

is very bad. And the smoke hurt my health. So, I think smoking should be completely 

banned.
