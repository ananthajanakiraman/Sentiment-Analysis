Tobacco is a kind of drugs. Many people die for smoking every year in Japan. Drugs injure only users. On the other hand tobaccos injure not only users but also people around users. This is passive smoking. Nowadays, there are classified into smoking area and non-smoking area in many restaurants. However, in many cases it is not complete. Only a measure that classifies one space in two areas is not enough. This is because tobacco smoke spread and people in the restaurant including babies and women with child breathe smoke regardless of their will. If you made a wall between smoking area and non-smoking area, a problem could occur. Of course, customers are not injured by tobacco smoke. However, waiters are injured. Even if the number of people who are injured is small, we should completely ban smoking at all the restaurant in Japan. Some people sometimes insist smokerÅfs right. They say that it is natural that they can smoke everywhere at all time because tobaccos are legal different from drugs. It might be right. However, the human rights of victims of passive smoking are far more important than smokerÅfs rights. We canÅft ban smoking because it is legal. Therefore we must take action in order to protect ourselves from passive smoking. One of this is that smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
