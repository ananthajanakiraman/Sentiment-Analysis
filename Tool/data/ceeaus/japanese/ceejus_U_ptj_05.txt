I think it is important for college students to have a part time job. I have three reasons for this.  First, students should learn social manners while they are still students.  It is too late to learn them after having work or joining in a company.  They might take impolite actions and make their boss angry.  In order to prevent that kind of situation, students should know basic manners such as using polite words, how to act to customers, and responsibility towards their work.  Second, students should know how hard and bone-breaking it is to earn money.  If they have no chance to learn about it, they would probably spend much money that their parents had earned, without knowing how precious and valuable money is.  Lastly, students should encounter with many people while they are young.  I think it is not good to stay in small groups, which members consist of only their college friends.  It might be helpful to have friends or people whom students can rely on, other than just their college friends.  What is more, learning co-workersÅf lifestyles may have good effects to them and inspire their way of living.  These are the reasons I agree with the idea, it is important for college students to have a part time job.
