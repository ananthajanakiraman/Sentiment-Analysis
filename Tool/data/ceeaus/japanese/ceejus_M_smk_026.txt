In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. 
		The first reason is that people should have meals at restaurants. I do not agree with smoking at restaurants. What are restaurants for? Everyone go to restaurants to eat, not to smoke. If someone wants to smoke, he or she should not go to restaurants. And smoking would weaken the sense of taste. Anyone donÅft want to weaken their sense of taste.
		The second reason is that when smoking is completely banned at restaurants the smoke may come to non-smoking sheets. Smoking is completely banned at some restaurants but there are smoking sheets and non-smoking sheets at most of restaurants in Japan. I think this is not good. I insist that restaurants should remove all smoking sheets.
	And the third reason is that smoking is harmful for everyoneÅfs health at all. Drinking alcohol has some good points but smoking does not have even one good point. Moreover, smoking is harmful for other people who donÅft smoke. It is important to think about other people. If smoke disappear from Japan, everyoneÅfs health could be better in Japan.
Because of These three reasons, I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
