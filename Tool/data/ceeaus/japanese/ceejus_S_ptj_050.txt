I agree in this opinion. At first, college is the place where we learn many kind of knowledge, but there are few chances to learn social rules. So a part-time job gives us opportunities to learn about society. We have to prepare for commonsense of society by graduating from school. If we know commonsense of society and have experience of job, we would be a social member smoothly. First impression is very important, so people who have experience of a part-time job give good image to his or her boss. His or her boss may think of him or her like having good ability of job.

 Secondly, we learn human relations by having a part-time job. There are opportunities to do a job with person whom we donÅft like, but it is important to do job together.

 Finally, we get money by having a part-time job. College student need money to play with friends, buy clothes and school expenses. To help with household economy is important and parents are pleased that their children earn money. Excess part-time job is not good because college studentÅfs job is study, but moderate part-time job gives us many experiences. So I think that to have a part-time job is important for college students.
