I am opposite to the part-time job of the college students. Because I think that student's obligation is in study. If college students work part-time job, it is likely to become whether the nature is taken from the university student in the part-time job, and studies are sparse. Moreover, when becoming a college student, the college students in Japan tend not to study especially because he or she has studied for a difficult university examination. Therefore, it is necessary to work hard at study. However, it is likely to become whether study is sparse when working part-time. It is difficult we for men to unite quite two. It is very small number of people even if there is a person who can do. Therefore, it is more efficient than it concentrates on one at secondarily it simultaneous. Additionally, I want you to make a lot of time that concentrates on study to learn it to the university student because there are a lot of things that can be learnt only when is in the university. Because it is the last chance that the university can study, and the studied time be taken, I want you to use the university enough. These are the reasons that I oppose the part-time job of the university student though the above-mentioned is only one side.
