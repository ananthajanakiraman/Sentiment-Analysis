I think that it is important for college students to have a part time job. Because we can get many things if we have a part time job. Firstly, we can get money. College students need much money for life. But we canÅft receive all money from parents. We realize that earning money is not easy when we work hard. And we come to cherish money. Secondly we can see the world we didnÅft see before. We must work for many guests. And we realize that we can live thanks to many people and come to appreciate their work. Thirdly we come to cooperate with a variety of people. There are many kinds of people in the work. We are different from them in many ways. And working with them is very difficult. But we can grow if we overcome this trouble. cooperation is very important for the future. Thus we come to do many things and we grow. Before we become a member of society, we can experience working. This will be useful for our future.
