I agree that college students would be better to have a part time job. This is because I have the three following reasons. Firstly, we can have a lot of life by having a part time job, for we can experience many works such as convenience store, bar, and fast food restaurant. Secondly, we, college students, can meet many people and get something out of them. Lastly, we can save much money and then visit lots of countries. These are two merits. One is because I think you had best go to the country where it is spoken in order to master a foreign language. Two is because with much money we can do our own favorite thing during school holidays. I wanted to write more sentences, but I have passed 40 minutes. IÅfm sorry.
