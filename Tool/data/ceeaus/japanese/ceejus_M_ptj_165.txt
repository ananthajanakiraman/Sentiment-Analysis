"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.

 

The reason why doing a part-time job is good thing for college students is that working students get sociability. And they feel themselves a part of society. When they notice that themselves work hard, they are glad that they are a member of society. Then young people feel respectable man.

And they also recognize the importance of money. If they do, they waste no more money even if they have not done until now.

 

In my case, when I was a high school student, I did a part-time job. At the time I felt working to be very flesh. And by working, I felt becoming adult human a little. And I became to waste no more money without notice.

 

It is true that some of them work so hard that they could not go to college or do not study but work hard.

But the problem is balance of things. Everybody could have at least a little free time. They should use it effectually. So they could spend good time.

 

This is why I agree that college students do a part-time job.

I think that our college should encourage doing a part-time job more.
