I agree with this statement because there are two reasons. Firstly, a cigarette does harm not only smoker, but also people that are around smoker. And secondly, smoke disturbs comfortable eating time. 

It is said that smoking shortens smokersÅf life. Person who often smokes is likely to get severe disease, for example cancer, and die in his early age. If someone smokes in official space like a restaurant, smoke of cigarette spreads around smoker, and people around him are also damaged from cigarette. Unfortunately, harm which people around smoker receive is much bigger than harm which smoker receives.  

Bad smell also spreads during smoking. For smoker smell of cigarette may be good, but it is quite bad for nonsmoker. Smoke makes nonsmoker uncomfortable. At restaurant many people, from children to senior, enjoy eating dishes. They are enjoying both tasting and smelling nice foods. But with smoke, they canÅft enjoy special eating time perfectly. Smoke prevents nonsmoker from smelling delicious foods.

Like this, smoking causes trouble to many customers who donÅft smoke. So Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Smoker should smoke in private space, should not smoke in official space where there are many people who donÅft like smoke.
