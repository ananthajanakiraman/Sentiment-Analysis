 

Banning from smoking at all the restaurants in Japan is the very nice policy for non smoking people, I think. Smoking in public often makes other peopleÅfs health bad. Of course, a person who smokes well has very bad health, too. 

Precisely, why are there many people who smoke well? I have not the answer. I think that smoking has not any good point. However many people like smoking. May be, it is because of taste. For instance, drinking alcohol is with each taste, too. Drinking does not give other people big trouble. So I think it need not be banned from drinking. But, smoking is different from it. Smoking usually gives other people trouble. For instance, they are other peopleÅfs health, mind, and visual. This is a very big problem. Extremely saying, it can have done not to trouble other people, but it must not have done to trouble other people. This is the only one thing that I want to insist.

              Today, there are many restaurants which have the role of smoking in Japan. But, I want more. I really want all the restaurants in Japan to ban from smoking or have harder role. And people should not smoke not only in public as a restaurant, but also anywhere.
