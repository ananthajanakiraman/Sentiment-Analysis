Tabacco contains so many sorts of poison. For instance, nikotin is most famous poison of them. So Smoking is not good for manÅfs health. If smoking gives only smokers bad effects, people should be allowed to smoke at the public situation, for example restaurants, offices, schools and even trains. But actually, it harms not only smoking people but also many other non-smoking people around them. In other word, many people who do not smoke may be suffered from a lot of smokeÅfs bad effects. It is so terrible story that non-smoking man is died of cancer because he had been with heavy smokers. In particularly, at the public space such as restaurants, there are many kinds of people, not to say, there are babies, young children and older. They are so to speak people who are likely to be affected by the situation around them. It never happen that younger people who have many wonderful futures are made to abandon them due to smoking bad effects. Thus, it is not too much to say that smoking at the public space is equal to murder. Those who hope to smoke should go other place, where non-smoking people are not to be found, and they will smoke calmly without being said complaints.
