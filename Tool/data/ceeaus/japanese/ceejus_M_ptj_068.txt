I think that college students should work a partÅ|time job. 
  I have three reasons why they should work.  First, they have much time to do anything. If they donÅft after classes at university, they must be bored and gray.
Second, if they donÅft have so much money, they will not be able to make their friends easily. I think that in their life to have much money is the key to live their life happily.
Finally, I think that to work a part-time job is to practice to go out in society.
 They can get moral and manners at workplace because they can contact with elder people. 
 I work three kinds of part-time jobs now. It was not until I begin to work that to make money is very heavy. Due to this feeling, these days I hesitate to buy trivial things ,for example, juice by the vending machine, snack at convenience store and game soft etcÅc
 Moreover, when I have much money,  I become to think that I want to buy brand clothes and more expensive things than before.  I think very much that to work a part-time job is necessary for them to live schoolÅfs life happily.
