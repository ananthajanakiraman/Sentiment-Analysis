I think itÅfs important for college students to have a part time job.  IÅfll show you three examples why itÅfs important.

First, we should have a social experience as many as possible when we are college students.  Because we have to work in society when we graduate from our school. If we have a part time job when we are college students, the experience will help us when we have an honest job.

Second, we can use money freely if we have a part time job.  But we will realize that money decreases soon.  So we can learn we should control our money.

Third, we will learn how we can get along with our boss and colleague.  I think itÅfs important for us to live in society.  Because human beings canÅft live alone in society.

ItÅfs true that we have to study very hard.  Because we are students.  So studying is the most important job college students have to do.

However, studying isnÅft all.  There are many things college students have to learn.  And we can learn some of them if we have a part time job.  So I agree with the idea part time job is important for college students.
