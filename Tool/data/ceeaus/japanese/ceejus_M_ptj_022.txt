I agree this statement. There are two reasons about that. One reason is that college students need a lot of money for campus life, group activities and club activities. There are a lot of people in the University. So they have a lot of friends and they often play with them by spending money. And in the University, there are no school uniforms. So they care their clothes, and buy a lot of clothes. And a monthly club expenses, camp expenses and drinking party expenses are too high for college students to pay without working part-time. And school expenses, travel expenses and prices of textbooks are very high, too. So college students should do part-time job to reduce their parentsÅf pays. Another reason is that to do part-time job is a good opportunity of experiencing communities. By doing part-time job, they can know hardness of earning money, and need of patience. That will have them contacting with other part-timers gently. And that will be useful to look for work in the near future. Today, college students are called for rich experience more than school background. By such reasons, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
