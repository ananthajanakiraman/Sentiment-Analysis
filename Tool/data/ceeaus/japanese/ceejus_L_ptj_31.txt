"I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
I state the reason now.
First!! Use the time effectively!
College students comparatively have more free times compared with a member of society. Time is precious if we spend the time wastefully. Therefore, we have a part-time job. By doing part-time job, we get money. We will be able to go shopping and to the movie by the money in next free time. This cycle make the time effective.
Second!! Get money that we can use freely.
We can buy many things (car, house, jewelry, clothes, bags, plane ticket, and so on) which we want no matter how it is much by the money. 
Third!! Learn society
I think that to learn society is most important when we are at university. To learn society means that we acquire decency and learn communication with seniors or juniors in business. We can do them by part-time job. Surely, a way of learning society is not only part-time job. But, it is the most suitable because it is the nearest to the society on the point of business.
Some people may argue that we neglect study. I think so too. But there are many merit of supplementing it. So, I agree to have a part-time job.
