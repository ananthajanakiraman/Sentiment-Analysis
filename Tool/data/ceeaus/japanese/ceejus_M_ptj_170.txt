"I agree with that idea. Of course it is the most important thing for college students to study what they will use in their future, such as their majors and common senses, and I think so, too. But I also think that it is important for them to experience various things. Most of those who have a part-time job can gain not only money for their work, but also what is important to live their lives, such as the way to communicate with people and to know how important it is to be responsible for what they do or say. Moreover, while most of us have to choose our own jobs which we will have done until we become around 60 before we graduate from the colleges, we have too little information to do so when we enter them. Therefore, to make up the shortage of it, they should have it. However, it is also the fact that there are many students who spare too much time and donÅft study hard. We must know that it costs more than we are paid for our own work to have a lecture. So I think that they need to think more seriously about how to use time including studying, working, playing and so on.
