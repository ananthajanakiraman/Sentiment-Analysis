I aÇç opposite to smoking at public places, particularly in a restaurant.
In restaurant, we enjoy eating, but if there are people smoking next to us, we canÅft enjoy eating satisfactorily. As smoke smell strongly, a sweet smell of dish are denied. When I go to restaurant, every times waiters ask me ÅeÅf which do you choose Smoking seat or Non Smoking seat?Åh So, almost all times, I can choose seat which I want. 
However, for the most part, this distinction is very vague. In other word, Smoking and Non Smoking seat are not separate from each other completely. For example, Smoking seat is located next to Non smoking seat, and smokes are carried from Smoking to Non Smoking. After all, I have to breathe in smoke going against my mind.
What is more, smokes from cigarette, called Secondhand smoke, are much more poisonous than smokes that smoker breathes in, called Main current smoke. 
Smoking imposes high risk on us. If we continued smoking, we become easy to get sick.
Cancer, the apoplexy, and cardiac infarction, etc. are the examples.
There is nothing by smoking, and we lost a lot of things.
Therefore, if there are feelings that think about public health, the government should forbid smoking completely.
