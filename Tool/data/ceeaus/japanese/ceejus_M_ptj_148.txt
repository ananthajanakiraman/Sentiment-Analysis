"I agree with the statement that college students should have a part-time job.

First there is no doubt that people who have had a part-time job must be equipped with normal sense of money because such people are able to know the importance of money and would not like to waste their money. 

Second, college students who have a part-time job are able to experience strictly of working. One reason is that as their superiors and seniors scold them they are going to begin to feel the sense of insecurity and they must be going to develop mature as person.

 Third they are likely to communicate with various people and learn how to get along with people particularly the service.

Forth I think that the recent trend of collegeÅf students trying to have a part-time job aggressively will have a good influence on them. Because by making much more of an effort to do the job well, there will be more opportunities for college students to think about the job.

Last I think that having a part-time job means not only getting much money but also contributing to society. For these reason I am in favor of the opinion that college students should have a part-time job.
