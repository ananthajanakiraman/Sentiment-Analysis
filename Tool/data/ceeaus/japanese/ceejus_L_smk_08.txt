I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Smoking has some problems. 
        First, cigarettes have a nicotine. This has drugÅfs elements like a malaria. DrugÅfs elements are very dangerous, in order to be a nicotine, you can not stop to smoke. I donÅft know the mind of junkies that continue to smoke. But if they want to stop to do, I get pity for them. 
        Second, cigarettes have tars. Many people think tars are substances promoting cancer growth. And cigarettes have more than forty kinds of substances promoting cancer growth. Cancer is also danger. I donÅft have heard easy cancer treatment. 
        Third, smokers and around people breathe in CO gas. CO tends to combine with Hb called hemoglobin. Hb is a role transporting Oxygen to all body.  
        Fourth, tabacoÅfs smell is always avoided. One of the people is me. I like clear and clean air. 
        Finally, smoking is harmful to health of no smoking people. Thin is the worst point in smoking problems. So, I donÅft want you to smoke at place existing smokeless people. But, if restaurants are separating smoking space from no smoking, I may permit to smoke at restaurants. Then, of course, restaurants must not come drifting smoke.
