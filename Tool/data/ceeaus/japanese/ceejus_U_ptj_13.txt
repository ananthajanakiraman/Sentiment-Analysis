I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. IÅem a part-time worker as a clerk in a cake shop. Before I have this part-time job, I thought it is not important for college students to have a part-time job because it is more important for us to study. But in the last winter, I became accustomed to a campus life and I started to work part-time for the first time in my life. And I learned too many things there. IÅfll pick out three things. 
First, I learned how hard to earn money. I think there is no way to earn money easily. I gave presents for my parents by my first pay to say thank you.
Secondly, I learned how important to have responsibility. OneÅfs tiny miss affects every membersÅf work and the cake shop as a whole. But my employer said Ågit is important to cope with the problem well, not to make mistakes.Åh I am encouraged by this hearty word.
Finally, I learned how pleasing to have a part-time job. I can see the world that I donÅft notice as a customer and it is pleasing to give a reward for myself. And what is the most important thing for me is to get acquainted with many people through this job.
I think having a part-time job is good for oneself and for all. It is the good chance for college students to learn many important things before becoming a member of society.
