I agree with this idea. There are three reasons why I think itÅfs important for college students to have a part-time job.
     Firstly, you should think every student from poor to rich. It cost about \1,200,000 a year to spend a campus life. So I think itÅfs hard for the parents to make that money. Especially, economic statement is not so good in this age. So I think many students donÅft have enough money. And they have to earn money for their lives. 
     Secondly, college students must enjoy their free time. As you know, students have much time to enjoy something. For example, trip, karaoke, club activity, party and so on. And each leisure cost a lot of money. In my experience, it cost about \35,000 for my clubÅfs training stay in Nara last summer. I think it too expensive, but it is essential. So it depends, but many poor students must earn money to enjoy club activities.
     Thirdly, it gives us a lot of valuable experiences to do a part-time job. For example, importance of patience, to work effectively, teamwork and so on. I work at restaurant. At there, I often warned something and learned something. And I think student grow little by little through that experience.
     IÅfd like to say most is it is important to experience a part-time job and experience a real social world. Of course working for life and leisure is important. Some people would say it interrupt studying, but I think part-time job experience is more important than just studying their major.
