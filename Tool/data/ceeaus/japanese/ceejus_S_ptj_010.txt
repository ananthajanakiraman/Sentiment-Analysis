ÅgIt is important for college students to have a part-time jobÅh, I agree to this opinion on the large. But it is according to circumstances, I think.

A lot of college students have some part-time jobs. Many of them will learn how difficult to earn and how difficult to get along well with other people. To have a part-time job is a direct experience of a social life. If they think that working is fun and they want to go even every day, or they need money, part-time job is wonderful for the students.

However, it has both good and bad points in the nature of things. I have a part-time job now. IÅfve been worked at the ceremonial hall as a wedding stuff since last month. Of course we are happy to help the customerÅfs marriage and we get a lot of money. But we get tired very much. To help a wedding ceremony, we go on working for more than 6hours without eating meals and going the toilet. We work until 10p.m. every weekend, sometimes until 1a.m. We have no time to do homework, club activities, and so on. I feel like quitting my job.

 It is important for college students to study and to keep company with friends too. If a part-time job occupies most of their time so they canÅft do anything, they had better not have it. When college students decide to have a part-time job, they have to consider their time and strength.

 In conclusion, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job as far as circumstances permit.
