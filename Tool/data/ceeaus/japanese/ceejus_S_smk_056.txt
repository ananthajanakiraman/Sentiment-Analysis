I agree with an opinion that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan . Because restaurants are originally places where we eat some food, but do not smoke. If someone smokes by us when we eat some delicious food, we will be made feel so bad by the smoke. I think the smoke spoil some delicious food. And I think some people who visit the restaurants to eat some food may become ill if someone smokes. Someone who does not smoke is more damaged than someone who smokes, so I think it is unreasonable that some people who pay some money to eat delicious food are damaged by the smoke which is discharged by smokers. After all smoking is forgiven if someone smoke alone putting some distance from other distance, but it is not forgiven when someone smoke in the public places such as restaurants, because it trouble other people and give them the damage. I think that another problem related to smoking is a cigarette end. If someone smokes in the restaurant, the clerks must handle it and it is very dirty. I think it is fatal for all the restaurants. So I agree with the statement that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
