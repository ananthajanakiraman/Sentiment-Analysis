I agree to the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all
the restaurant in Japan. There is three reason.
First, the smell of cigarette adheres to cloths. It may be no problem
for smokers,but those who stop smoking can not endure the smell.
Certainly, most restaurants divides into the smoking place and the no
smoking place, but I do not think that it is effectual.
This way can not stop smell adheres to cloths.
Second, smoke of cigarette is bad for the body. It seem to be worse for
those who stop smoking than for smoker. Possibly, smoker might be
killing those who stop smoking. Though there are still other things,
tentaverity, the above is adverse effect on the person.
Finaly, scenery with cigarette is ineffectualy for restaurants. In
modarn days when it is said to stop smoking, it is kept at a distance by
the guest only there is cigarette. So sales of the shop worsen. In a
word, adverse effect of smoking is not only body.
From the above mentioned, cigarette has many disadvantage,so I agree to
the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the
restaurant in Japan.
