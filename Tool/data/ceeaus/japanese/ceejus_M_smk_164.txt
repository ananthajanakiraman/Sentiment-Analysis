In the other place you can't smoke while you are walking. You should pay 1000 yen fine if you are witnessed by them. They earn 60000 yen in three weeks. Some people even say raise the price itself   to 1000. So why not, restaurants also should make smoker at unease. In Japan we rarely warn smoker. This is famous phrase "too much smoking have possibility to do you harm" Is this advice or something? In Japan this is the very warning. Cigarette do them harm and are useless. Of course restaurants don't have to care health of their customers. If they hesitate to serve food to overweight person, they can't go around. But don't you want to go such restaurants?  in the case of cigarette, it is worth doing. Practically, some restaurant don't make seat for smokers.
