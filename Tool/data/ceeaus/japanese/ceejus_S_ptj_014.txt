I think that it is very important for college students including me to have a part time job. I have two reasons for this.
First, through working, we can earn money. Of course, Money is not everything for our life, but if we have no money, we cannot live in this capitalistic society. My parents send me money every month, but it is too little to live. So, I work part time to earn my living. Working is very hard for me. I donÅft know the value of money until I start working. I think we need to know really moneyÅfs worth before grow up in order to live happy.
Second, we can practice and experience the real world by having part time job. Most of us work for a company in the future. So, I think it is very helpful. I work at a restaurant two days at a week after school. There I study what kind of job each person does and how everyone communicates. I learn it is important to think myself and act immediately with having a responsibility. It is difficult to learn such things at school. Working part time is really widens my views.
 Because of these reasons, I believe it is important for college students to have a part time job. It is very important for our life to study delightful, to work hard, and to play enough.
