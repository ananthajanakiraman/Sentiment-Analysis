"I agree with this statement. This is because, I think it will be a good
experience to work as part-timers during we are college students.
An experience gained in working will not be an obstacle thing but useful
in the real world. For example, we can appreciate the worth of money or
learn to take a well-mannered attitude.
And also in our college lives, we will spend a lot of money for a party
with our friends or mates, club activities, buying ourselves new clothes
or bags and so on. So I think we should work and get money by ourselves,
if possible.
On the other hand, some people may say that we should not have a
part-time job. Of course we must study hard. If we spend a lot of time
rather working than studying, we will make the meaning of entry of this
college be completely worthless.
So we must manage to study and take part-time jobs at the same time, if
we take them. It is very difficult. But I think taking a part-time job
in our college lives brings us various experiences rightly or wrongly.
But I donÅft have any part-time job now. So IÅfm looking for."
