I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. There are two reasons about my opinion.
 Firstly, it is bad for us to smoke, though this is not only problem in the restaurants. And smoking does not only harm the smokers, but also harm the nonsmokers. I think that this is a strange story. Smoking not only harms the customers who come to a restaurant but also harms the workers who work on a restaurant. If we work on restaurant from morning till night everyday, the passive smoking will harm our health. ÅgPassive smokingÅh is the act of breathing in smoke from other peopleÅfs cigarettes. The passive smoking more harms our health than the active smoking. So if we make our health care hard, it may be bad for us to work on a restaurant. I think that we should keep our offices clean, when we consider the workerÅfs health. 
 Secondly, smoking makes the taste of a delicious meal bad. And smoking also spoils a cheerful mood of the meal. We do not come to enjoy at all for this. I had had a hot time with my friends, when I went to a restaurant with friends. But I got out of the restaurant, for I hated next customer to smoke.
 Therefore, I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
