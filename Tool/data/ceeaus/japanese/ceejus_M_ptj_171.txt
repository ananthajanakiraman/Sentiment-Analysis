"I agree with this statement because I think that to have a part-time job is precious experience. If we had a part-time job, we could experiment rule of society and difficulty of earning money. 

As an other reason, college students need much money. For example, some students live alone, so they cost much money at lighting, heating, food, water expenses and rent and so on. Therefore it is important for college students to have a part-time job.

When I high school student, I had experimented three kind of part-time job. As an end of first grade, I began a part-time job. It was a restaurant. Sadly, I quitted this job only three months because of the trouble about relation of owner.

Next spring vacation, I had had a part-time job. It is a arrangement of the good in the shed. It was also short time job.

From next May, I had worked at Tounichisuisan which manage distribution. Hourly wage was 850 yen. It was a rare case for high school students. Because it is general case for high school students that hourly wage is about 750 yen. I had worked there about ten months.

I learned many things through these experiments. It is important for working to communicate well at work. Working is very hard over my expectation. I realized that money and time is so important.
