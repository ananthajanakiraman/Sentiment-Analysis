I agree with this suggestion. It is very good for us to work when we are university students. I have some reasons for that.
First, we can earn money if we have part time jobs. This is a wonderful point of a part time job because our parents donÅft have to give us a lot of money. We are old enough to have a job. So we should work and help our parents. Moreover, we can know how hard to earn money is, and we realize the importance of money and the greatness of our parents.
Second, we can spend time usefully. University students have a lot of time that we donÅft have to study. We can do anything in that time. But, it is very bad to spend that time only playing because we waste much money. What is more, we forget studying and miss passing the examination. We canÅft graduate from Kobe university.
Third, we can have a good time to work with our elders. They know more things than us. If we work with them, we can get a lot of knowledge and know-how to live, work and win. We will be able to live comfortably in the future. 
Having a part time job has a lot of good points! So I suggest to university students that they should work.
