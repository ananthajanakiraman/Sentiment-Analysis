  I think that we do not need smoking, but I disagree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at the restaurant in Japan.

  First, if we ban to smoke at the restaurant, I think that people who like smoking will be poor. Though people who do not like smoking be poor too, I think that it is not a problem if restaurants make seats in the smoking section or a smoking room. For people who always smoke, if restaurants suddenly ban to smoke, they cannot deal with this opinion.

  Second, I think that the proceeds of restaurants will decrease if restaurants ban smoking. This is because all of the smokers do not want to go to the restaurants. I think that the number of smokers is not few, so they should not ban to smoking. Of course, needless to say, they must protest the location which people who do not smoke have. It is OK if we think both people. 

  This is why, though we have to take people who do not like smoking into consideration, I think that we do not need to ban to smoke at the restaurants in Japan. We should protect the right of smoking there.
