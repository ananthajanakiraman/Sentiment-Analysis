I disagree with that. Though every student with a part-time has different opinion towards or purpose for it, that does not mean that everyone feels it important to have a part-time job. They do not always consider the importance of job, but feel like to do it because most people around his/her have their job. There are other reasons. In general, part-time jobs foster social skills such as communication, cooperation. But these skills can also be acquired even if not having any part-time jobs. College students have a lot of time. Therefore, we can share with various kinds of people a lot of experiences such as clubs, circles, volunteer activities, and so on. I assume that we need to be related to various people from hard workers to younger people. Some people say that they should do for making money for living expenses. However, they do not always have difficulties with money. This is a completely private matter. So others have nothing to do with it. Extravagant students may need to have a job, but those with sense of frugality do not always need to. These are reasons for which I consider a job not to be needed, and I cannot find any reasons that make a job necessary
