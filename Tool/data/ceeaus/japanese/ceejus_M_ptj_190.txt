 In the case of this question, apart from issue which we need money or not
, I think that it is not the most important for us to have a part-time job. Bu
t I am sure that in college life it might be important to do in some degree. E
ven if we need so great money, money is especially and useful to live. Therefo
re, there is no reason for not having a part-time job. In other opinions, to h
ave a part-time job is practical for our experience of life. Surely, it is imp
ortant to have a part-time job in order to experience a society. But, I think 
that in college we should make effort to learn various things. If anything, I 
would like to have general knowledge and expert skill through my college life,
 since I entered the department of applied chemistry in Technology. To be hone
st, it is now so difficult for me that the special knowledge of technology is 
very wide, deep and complicated. Therefore, I think that it is more important 
to learn hard, than earn money, for my sake of work as a scientist in future. 
Of course, I profess myself to fond of earning much money.
