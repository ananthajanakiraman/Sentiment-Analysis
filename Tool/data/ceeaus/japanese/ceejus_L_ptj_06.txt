I think that a part time job is important for college students. I have several reasons and anxiety. The first reason is a shortage of money. Students who are given enough money by their parents are a minority. Moreover they spend a lot of money for various purposes. For example, clothes, CDs, furniture and foods. So they must earn money as much as possible. The second reason is that the experience of a part time job gives us various abilities which are important to work as a member of society. If they experience teaching, they get an ability to express their thought simply. If they work at the restaurant, they learn to be able to behave politely. For these reasons, I insist that a part time job is important for college students. But, it is not pleasant to concentrate all their energies on a part time job. It is clear that they are students. So it should be avoided to neglect their study. Furthermore a part time job can cause dangers. For example, a crime may happen at their workplace when they work. Therefore I think it is important to understand faults of a part time job and cope with the both of study and work.
