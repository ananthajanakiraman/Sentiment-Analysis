I donÅft agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan, because those are the place where customers enjoy not only eating but also having a conversation and atmosphere. If the guests only do eat some hood there, smoking should be controlled. But people come to the restaurant in order to relaxing and enjoying by having meals. Imagine it when you are prohibited from wanting to do----now you want to be smoking in this case-----,though you expected. I know many of smokers want to have a smoke after the meal. Please think that it is similar feeling to after the meal coffee in the person who has not smoked. Setting you have to take meals quickly aside, it is very boorish thing when you are deprived of the enjoyment of after the meal. 
And I do not say that I want to take smoking in everywhere. Only I am unpleasant in all seat no smoking. So, in restaurant, I think that it is good to divide the smoker seat and stop smoking seat. In not only smoking problems but also every thing, I think that it is good not to exclude only one side not to recommend only one side. People think about themselves and feel things in various ways, so I oppose the opinion that smoking should be perfectly forbidden at all the restaurants.
