I agree with the statement.
IÅfm nonsmoker. I dislike other peopleÅfs smoking when I have meals.
ThatÅfs because my foods become bad if anyone smoke near me at the
restaurant. In such a case, I sometimes feel anger. I want to eat my
foods deliciously. Surely it is a suffering for smokers that they must
not smoke at the restaurant. But I want them to endure smoking during
meals because smokers may enjoy it but nonsmokers feel pain for it.
Now, many restaurants divide their room into two rooms, which are
smoking room and nonsmoking room. But I think that smokers can put up
with smoking during meals because the time they spend having meals is
30~60 minutes and the time is very short.
In the first place, the smoking does you no good and much harm. It is
useful when you want to get temporary pleasant feelings, but it is
absolutely bad for your health. The benzopyrene which is included in
cigarettes changes your base sequence of the DNA. It is a terrible
material. Smokers should stop smoking. We should quit bad habits.
I cannot understand why smokers depend on such a thing. Human beings
should not depend on such a things. I think so.
