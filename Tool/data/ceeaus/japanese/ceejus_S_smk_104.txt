Smoking in the restaurants makes people uncomfortable. When non-smoker goes to a restaurant with a smoker, he should have a meal in smoking area. In the area, non-smokers have no choice but to endure the smoke while eating. Smokers may enjoy eating and smoking after their meal. However, non-smokers cannot enjoy their meal because of smoke around them. Smokers should refrain from smoking in the restaurant for non-smokers. Restaurants are closed space, so smoke generated in smoking area eventually comes to non-smoking area. The smoke coming from smoking area ruins dinner time. It is no use separating smoking area from non-smoking area. Some people in non-smoking area may get angry unless smoking in the restaurants is banned. According to some medical reports I have read, smoking increases the risk of developing the lung cancer in the future. Passive smoking also does. The younger smokers are, the higher the risk is. There must be many children accompanied by their parents in the restaurant. Even though they are in non-smoking area, they may be attacked by smoke coming from smoking area. We have to prevent children from developing the cancer because of passive smoking. It is very efficient way that  people are prohibited to smoke in the restaurant.
