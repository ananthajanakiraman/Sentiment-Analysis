I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.

They can know importance of money and joy of earning money by themselves. If they are given money by parents or other people, they can't know these things.

And they can experience many things, which can't be experienced in the college life, in a part-time job. For example, they learn manner as worker or service for customer, work with adults, teach a child what they have ever been taught in school, and so on.

These things are very important to work in the society in the future.

I have taught math to a high school student in a few days in summer vacation of this year. It was difficult but very good experience to teach anything to a person who doesn't know it, and to think how to say to be understood what I want to tell.
However, I don't think that college students have to do a part-time job. Study is more important than a part-time job for them. If a part-time job stops a college student from studying, he mustn't do a part-time job. And college students shouldn't do a part-time job at night.
