"I think it is important for college student to have a part-time job.
I have three reasons to think that.
First, I can ready to go out into the world. 
If I go into the world without having a part-time job, IÅfll be in trouble because I couldnÅft learn the manner to contact with others and the basic attitude on business.
 I think I can learn the important elements of working in a part-time job.
Second, I can understand the significance of money and the hardness to earn money through part-time job. 
When I was still high school student, I took some money from my parents as pocket money and I used them without thinking specially.
 But after I learn the hardness to earn money, I thank for my parents. 
That is, I could study the value of money.
Third, I can make many friends besides friends of college. 
If I donÅft I have a part-time job, when I try to make friends, it is not easy to get out of a narrow range as a college.
A part-time job is a place for meeting. 
I can meet people of another college or much older people or much younger people.
 They give me chances to enlarge my experience.
The above explains why I think a part-time job is important for college students.
Let me finish report with this.
