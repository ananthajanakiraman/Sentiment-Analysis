I think that it is not good ideas.  Nowadays, cigarettes are said that bad items for smokers and people who are surround them. Certainly, it causes cancer and a lot of disease. So a lot of people think that smoking is very unhealthy. But when people smoke, they feel happy, ecstasy and a sense of sin. I think that smokers do not think cigarettes are bad, and understand that others feel unhappy about smoking. So I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I propose that the restaurants should divide more certainly between a smoking room and a not smoking room. Now they are same floor in the restaurants. It is bad. For example one floor is all smoking, another is all not smoking. And they make a strong wall between smoking and not smoking. If they are able to do it, smoker and not smoker enjoy their dinner each other. If restaurants ban smoking, they will not have pleas at eating in the world. and restaurants can not earn an income. They have better not to ban smoking or to work out countermeasures. So I do not think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
