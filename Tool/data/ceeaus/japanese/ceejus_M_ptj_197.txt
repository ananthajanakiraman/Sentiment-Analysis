I agree to the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. We can learn importance to work and to have responsibility from a part-time job. It is just like a practice of a true job. It is hard to start a true job without a practice. Not only we are able to get money, but we can make new friends at workplace. We might be able to find a new way to think about our lifestyle, get new skills and become good at expressing ourselves. 

However, now my parents say that having a part-time job robbed me of a time to study, so they are unwilling that I start a part-time job. And I really have never had a part-time job yet. So I canÅft talk about a part-time job so well. Of course it is important for college students to study. But I think it is worth to do even if it shortens a time to study. I canÅft keep up with talks of my friends about a part-time job now. And I am sorry for my parents and my friends who do a part-time job hard. I would like to start a part-time job as soon as I can.
