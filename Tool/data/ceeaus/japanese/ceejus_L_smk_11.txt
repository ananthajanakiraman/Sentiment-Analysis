I agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. There are two reasons why smoking should be forbade at the restaurants. 
	First, the taste of the cooking became bad due to the smoke and smell of cigarette. If seats in a restaurant are divided between nonsmoking seat and smoking seat, smoke and smell flow to nonsmoking seat. This is the pain for nonsmokers.
	Second, smoking injures our health. Smoking harms not only smoking people but also people who donÅft smoke. All of us know that smoking causes lung disease. We 
Go to a restaurant in order that we will not increase risk of disease but enjoy eating a meal. So smoking should be banned at restaurant so that all people can enjoy eating or drinking.
	I know that there are a lot of people who canÅft quit smoking in Japan. But, for these two reasons, I want to prohibit smoking at restaurants.
