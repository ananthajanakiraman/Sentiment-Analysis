I agree this opinion.
 I think general college students should have a part-time job in order to get a lot of their life experience. By having part-time jobs, they can get skills to communicate with a variety of people, to do special task, and so on.
 However, this doesnÅft always apply to me.
I have three part-time jobs ( home teacher,ÅhjyukuÅh teacher, and horse racing course employee).
But, money that I got at racing course is not mine. It will be used for our horses. (I am a member of horse riding club, so we must work for our horses besides club dues.)
Surely, I could learn a lot of things by working there for a year. 
Teaching junior high school students and high school students is good review of our studying and I can know how difficult teaching other people is.
And I could learn about horsesÅf cure at racing course. (I work at horsesÅf clinic in racing course with animal doctor.)
 But, because I work five times a week, I myself lost time for spending a happy week-end dinner with family and studying chemistry and English. 
 That is why I said Ågthis doesnÅft always apply to meÅh.
