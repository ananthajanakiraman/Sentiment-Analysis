I do not think that to have a part-time job is important for college students. You have to, because students have to study hard to grant dream to them. If students waste many times to work part-time job, they do not have enough time to study. It might cause failure to grant dream. It is foolish. Why do they go to college? Is StudentÅfs duty working part-time job? No. StudentÅfs duty is study. Students must not forget it. 
Also, StudentÅfs parents work hard everyday to get school expense. Do parents hope that their children work part-time many times and lose time to study? It is impossible. Parents hope their children study hard. If parents pay school expense to college, children have to hear their hope and study hard.
But, some students need money for club activity and buying textbook. If they do not have enough money for school life, they need to have a part-time job. When students work part-time job to get money, they have to take care that they do not waste many times. It is important to balance working part-time job with studying.
There are reasons why I think ÅgA part-time job is not important for college studentsÅh. But, I have one more the reason. I can not work and study at once, so I envy the man who can work and study at once. It is another reason why I think part-time job isnÅft important for students.
