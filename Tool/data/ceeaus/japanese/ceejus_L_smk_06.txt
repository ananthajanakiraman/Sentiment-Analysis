Naturally, it is necessary to divide the smoking seat and the no smoking seat at a restaurant. 
Because I do not smoke, I think all seats no smoking to be good. However, if the smoking rate of Japan takes 25% into consideration, the separation of smoking areas might be the best selection. 

It is really unpleasant that they smoke in the vicinity though not all the person who doesn't smoke the cigarette feel so. It is unpleasant even to encounter in the town, much less at the table. 

Moreover, you will have divided the seat though it thinks from smoker's viewpoint. 
Following the trend of the times, smoking in the shop not separating smoking areas is considerably insensitive. I think that the shop shouldnÅft make them endure cigarette while they are in the shop. Of course you may be in the inside such a shop. However there are a lot who like smoking with or after eating. It is natural that the shop answers the demand.

To tell the truth, there are not so much a lot of stores where the seat is divided in the entire restaurant though in a fast food and a major multiple store the separation of smoking areas is common sense already. The consideration of the shop is certainly a problem. If possible, I think that you should make the no smoking seat. However guest's mind is most importantly. Do not smoke in when the trouble hangs in the person in the next seat.
