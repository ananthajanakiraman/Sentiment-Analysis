 In Japan, passive smoking, which often endangers non-smokersÅf health, is taken as one of the most serious problem. Therefore, many places have become non-smoking areas and still they are increasing. Indeed, we cannot regard it as a good practice. But smoking is not illegal for adults. So completely banning from smoking in all the restaurants is too strict. Moreover it can be one of the discriminative rules such as apartheid. Since we can smoke legally as long as we have lived more than twenty years, there should be both smoking areas and non-smoking areas in every building as there are both menÅfs rooms and womenÅfs room. But on one hand we have the right of smoking, on the other hand we have no right of hurting others. That means that smokers must be careful not to harm others. While smokers must care not to injure othersÅf health with the smoke they blew in restaurants, of course, there are limits of their efforts. To support them and make smoking customers and non-smoking ones comfortable together, restaurants need to do some solutions, perfectly separating both areas with walls for instance, instead of refusing smokers entering. For peopleÅfs happiness on each side, we should not quarrel with each side but seek the way to go with.
