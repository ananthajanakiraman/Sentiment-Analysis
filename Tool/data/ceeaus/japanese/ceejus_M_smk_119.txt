I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
 There are a few reasons.
 First of all, if someone smokes at the restaurant, those who dislike smoke of cigarettes will be uncomfortable. Some people have disease of their lungs. If they take smoke in, their disease will be worse and worse.
 Second, though there are some restaurants which separate tables where smoking is allowed from tables where smoking is banned, it is not very useful. For instance, assume that there are thirty seats where smoking is banned and twenty seats where smoking is allowed. If forty people who donÅft smoke and ten people who smoke come to the restaurant, ten people who donÅft smoke must wait and there are ten empty seats. This is not efficient. This is why it is not good to separate seats and smoking should be banned.
 Third, it is no need to smoke during meals. Smokers should be able to endure smoking for just short time. It is said that if we eat meals with smoking, meals get less delicious. So we should not smoke during meals.
 For these reasons, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
