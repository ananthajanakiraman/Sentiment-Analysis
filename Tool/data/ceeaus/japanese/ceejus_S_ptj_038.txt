I agree with this. I think that it is very important for courage students to do a part time job. I have two reasons for this. 
Firstly, courage students should realize that it is very hard to do a job and earn money. Of course, courage students must study hard at university. But if they donÅft do a part time job, they donÅft realize that it is very hard to do a job and earn money. Whoever has got a job finds that it is so hard to do a job and earn money. Some people become melancholic or commit suicide because it is so hard to do a job. So if courage students donÅft do a part time job, they will feel it harder to do a job and earn money.
Secondary, courage students need much money. High school students usually bring a box lunch, but courage students usually have lunch at dining room in university. They also go to drink with their friends. So they need so much money. In addition, some courage students live by theirselves. They must pay the rent and lighting and heating expenses. Their parents usually pay them, but it is important for them to pay them for theirselves. 
So I think that courage students have to do a part time job.
