I think it is good idea to ban people from smoking in restaurant in Japan.
Smoking damages smokerÅfs own health and his smoke damages people around him.
Tobacco contains nicotine which causes many terrible actions for us. 
Comparing with other advanced countries, the number of smokers of Japan is large.
In Japan, the price of cigarette is relatively low and some people feel that smoking is cool.
So the government of Japan should adopt a policy to decrease the number of that.
Smoking gives worse influences for minorsÅf health than adultsÅf
Beside sad to say, quite a few people in smokers started smoking when they are teenagers.
And most smokers tend to smoke after eating.
Even some of my friends say, ÅgIt is necessary for me to smoke after meals.Åh
If we forbid smoking in all restaurants, occasions of no smoking will increase and it may going to lead to decrease the number.
And because chances of minors seeing smoking people will also decrease, we will be able to reduce interests of them for smoking.
If we really carry out this plan, surely some smoking people will object against it.
But Japanese government should act for its own nation.
This is why I agree with the opinion that we should prohibit from smoking in all of the restaurant in Japan.
