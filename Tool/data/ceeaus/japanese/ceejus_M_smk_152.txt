You should not smoke at restaurants in Japan. Because smoking is not match with restaurants.
 First how places are restaurants? They are the spaces where people enjoy meal, without disturbance from others; however you also should not disturb others. You can talk with your friends, use cellular phone and do your homework, but you must not make a loud voice or sound there.
 Next what does smoking cause? Of course, cigarettes make smoke. It makes people feel unpleasant in many ways. Its smell is very bad; besides, it includes harmful matter for human body. A lot of people know the fact and almost all of them dislike the harmful smoke. Some feel unpleasant though they only see the smoke. That is to say, smoke from cigarettes can bother people.
 From the above, it is natural you should not confuse the two factors, restaurant as place and smoking.
 Nowadays, many restaurants have provided both smoking area and no smoking area. They have believed that customers were not disturbed by any smokers because they kept distance each other. But the fact the two factors have been confused in the same space is not good.  That idea is wrong. So, all the restaurants in Japan should completely ban smoking.
