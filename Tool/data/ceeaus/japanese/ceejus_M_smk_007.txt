I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan for three reasons. 
First, as you know, smoking is bad for your health. Even if you like smoking, you ought to reduce smoking. The law against smoking will be a chance for you to stop smoking during meals. 
Second, many people have dishes in restaurants. Though some of them may like smoking too, but others donÅft like it. You may say that these days more and more restaurants separate between smoking seats and no smoking ones. But smoke widen throughout the floor. Moreover, you can do harm much heavily in case children are there. Both physically and mentally, children are more effective than adults. It may inhibit them from growing! And of course you canÅft easily make up for it. You will get many responsibilities by smoking in public.
Third, smoking prevents you from tasting dishes. ItÅfs a pity that even though good chefs give you delicious plates, you wouldnÅft be able to feel anything special. ItÅfs also rude for the chefs. 
In the ends, by smoking you have a fun only for a second, and after that you will get many problems. I hear that many countries in the world have already banned smoking in public. They widely announce that smoking is a cause of many diseases. In Japan there are less strict against smoking now. But weather strict exist or not, you should stop smoking such places like restaurants where many people are.
