"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.

First, it is a good opportunity for us to know our society well.

When I finished the entrance examination of Kobe University, I started to work ice cream shop.

I had thought that I could enjoy working, but it was much harder than I had thought.

It was much harder than the study of examination in a sense.

I learned many things while I was working at the shop.

When I was selling ice creams, I involved with various people.

I had not been good at communicating with people before I worked.

However, while I involved with many people by selling ice creams, I could talk smoothly with people who I met for the first time.

I think I could grow myself by having a part-time job.

Thanks to a part-time job, I could have responsibility, and moreover, I can know the importance of money.

I learned how hard it was to earn money.

So, since I have started having a part-time job, I have not waste more money than before.

Furthermore, we could make many friends in a part-time job.

If I donÅft have a part-time job I cannot talk with a person who goes to another school.   

For these reason, I agree the opinion that it is important for college student to have a part-time job.
