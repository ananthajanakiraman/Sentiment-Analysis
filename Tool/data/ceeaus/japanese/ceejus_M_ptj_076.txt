    I agree with this opinion. It is important for college students to
have a part-time job, I think too. They need much money to play with
their friends, to buy cloths, books, CDs, DVDs and something they want,
and so on. So they should do a part-time job so as to earn this money.
This is one reason, of coarse.
    But there is more important reason. It is that they learn system in
society, hardness to earn money and important of money through the
part-time job. The system is that if they need money, they must work as
a member of society to earn money. When they were children they didnÅft
know important of money because their parents maybe gave them money. But
when they are adults they must earn money by themselves. As a pre season
to be adults, they should do a part-time job when they are college
students. By working as a member of society, they learn important of
money and know it is hard to earn money, which are not taught in a
school or college. If they learn that money is important, they donÅft use
much money and they donÅft buy things that are unnecessary. Then they get
ability to select what they need in a lot of things.
    Because of above reasons, I think it is important for college
students to have a part-time job.
