 I do not think that smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. It is fact that smoking does much harm not only to smokers but also to non-smokers. However, I have never felt being bothered by smokers at restaurants, as long as they are smoking at areas where smoking is allowed. Such areas are established because they help both smokers and non-smokers. Smokers should keep rules. In other words, their right should be kept as long as they keep rules. Smoking is a kind of amusement. We should not sing a song loudly at a street, but it is allowed at a karaoke box. Of course, I do not think smoking is not a good behavior, but as you know, smoking is very addictive. We should keep it in mind the idea that there are many people who cannot part with cigaretts. If we ban smoking at any place one after another, there will be no place where smoking is allowed, and finally many people complain. This is why I do not think that smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
