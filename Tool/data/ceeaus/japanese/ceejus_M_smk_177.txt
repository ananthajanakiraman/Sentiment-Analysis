I canÅft agree with what this author say. I believe that it is too doing. Smoking mustnÅft b
e prohibited at all the restaurants in Japan. By making rules about smoking and keeping thes
e rules strictly, other guests will be more pleasant. The making smoker defends it and the r
ule is lightened and the damage of smoke will be able to be lightened. They make children no
t to be breathed passive smoke, for instance. For another example, restaurants set up no smo
king areas and smokers use these absolutely. So nonsmokers will donÅft have to breath smoke.
 Still good other rules for the smokers and Iyakemuca exist. By the way, tabaccos contain ni
cotine, tar, and others. Nicotine and tar give smokers pleasure, and smoking touch is seemed
 to make smokers feel refreshed. Restaurants should make happy not only to nonsmokers, but a
lso to smokers, because all guests basically have the rights that they are given good servic
es by members in restaurants. It is possible for smokers to satisfy it only with smoking the
 cigarette. If it is a little amount in exchange for observing the rule, it is necessary to 
permit smoking. To conclude, I oppose the overall no smoking at a restaurant for the reasons
 stated above.
