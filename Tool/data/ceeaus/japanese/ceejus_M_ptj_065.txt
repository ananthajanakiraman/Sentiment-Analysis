I am for this idea.
College students ordinary have a lot of time. Of course, spending the time in studying is important for students, but, I think it is also valuable we have experience that we work to earn money. Because after we study something at university for 4 or 6or more years, we must work at company. Until then, we do only studying, when we start working, we might be at a loss. In order not to do so, I think doing a pert time job is valid.
And, if we do a part time job, we can do something favorite to spend money.
For example, traveling, studying abroad, buying somethingÅcetc. In order to do spending money and experiencing, we can get skill and knowledge and improve ourselves.
What is more, we can meet many people at the working place. If we donÅft do a part time job, we canÅft meet them. By meeting various people and talking about many things, we get various senses of values. And I think we can live a full life for that.
Lastly, by doing part time job, I suppose we can do better consumer on our time. 
That is why I think doing part time job is important for college students.
