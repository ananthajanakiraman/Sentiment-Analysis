I donÅft think that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan.
I have two reasons why I think so.
First, a lot of people hate to smoke or its smell. Especially in a restaurant, people have a meal. So smoking will disturb other peopleÅfs meal. However smoking will disturb a lot of peopleÅfs meal, I donÅft think that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. The problem can solve easily. To make a space which is separated perfectly other space for non-smoker. Thanks to this space, non-smoker will have a meal with good mood. 
Second, smoking is very bad for his health. His lung becomes black by cigaretteÅfs tar. But, smoking is not only bad points. For example smoking is good when I have nothing to do, I smoke and spent time with good mood. Moreover, when I am nervous, smoking will cool down me. 
Today, campaign against smoking is expanding gradually in Japan. But I can often see smokerÅfs bad manner about smoking. For example, throw a cigarette butt out on the street, smoking in non-smoking area, and so on.
Smoker should have a good manner about smoking, and get along with non-smoker. So, smoking should not be completely banned.
