"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.

Of course for college students, study is the most important in school days and it is not permitted part-time jobs to prevent students from studying. But I suspect that part-time job is also one of study.

 I have heard from my mother following thing. ÅgA student who has had some part-time job is more useful in the work place than a student who hasnÅftÅh. I really agree to this. 

  If they are going to get a job and work in society after graduation from university, I think a part-time job is good method as a preparation of becoming a working member. Because they can learn a feel of the work place, human relations, and manners in the business, and so on, if they have a part-time job.  And these are surely helpful to actual work place. A student who knows only study isnÅft needed from society.

  Then, speaking of salary which most of college students focus on, needless to say, college students need money but they have only a little money, moreover they are able to understand the importance of money by working and earning money themselves.

  ThatÅfs because, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
