I think itÅfs important for college students to do a part-time job.
There are some reasons I think.
First, the part-time job is a good chance that college students can touch the society.
In fact, it is the same for the member of the society and the person doing a part-time job to work and to earn money. And through the part-time job they will learn the importance of the relationship between persons and propriety. Because these are necessary if they have any work. I think such things are very important in being a member of society. I am working at the restaurant in Sannnomiya city four or five days in a week. IÅfm sure that I am learning such things.
Second, by doing a part-time job, they will help their parents on the economic front.
Because it costs considerable money to go to the university compared with the curriculum from an elementary school to a high school, there are many people who donÅft have room that pays school expenses. For such people, the income obtained by doing a part-time job will become some help.
That is why I think itÅfs important for college student to do a part-time job.
