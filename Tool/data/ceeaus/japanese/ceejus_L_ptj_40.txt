I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Because it is not only to give money but it is one of the social studies, I think. Almost of college students can get money that they need to live from their parents. So I think that we donÅft need to have a part time job for getting money. I donÅft have a part time job now. But I can live enough now. And, college students have to study. But to have a part time job is not only for to get money. It is good social studies. It makes me thinking to get money is what and work in the social is what. And, we can learn social rule, way of talk, and more. For my example, I had a part time job in YAKINIKU restaurant. My work in the restaurant is service customer. I learn how to talk to customer and rule of meal a little. And the restaurant has many foreign customers, so I can learn English in restaurant well. Part time job have many what to learn and is very good social study. So I think college student have to have a part time job.
