I think we need to do a part time job for some reasons.  Firstly, we can do what we usually donÅft do, and what we can do just now. When we work for company in the future, we will donÅft have much time. Then we canÅft challenge a lot of things, for we can do many type of job only in a part time job. It is a chance to see things from the other side.  Secondly, we can meet many type of people who we canÅft meet at college, because they are various generations or they live in a different environment. Lastly, we can understand how hard we get money. We have been raised by our parents, so we donÅft know their pains. But, we can know the value of parents and money by experiencing the hardships.  That is why I think we should do a part time job. So I want to experience many type of job and I hope to study many things that I can do only out of college.
