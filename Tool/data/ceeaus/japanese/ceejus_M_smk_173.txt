Nowadays the movement which decrease the number of smoker is being done. For instance a lot of restaurants forbid smoking completely. Exactly in many case smokers are disliked. I donÅft have friends who smoke, but if my friends smoke in restaurant, I am very abhor. I dislike the smell of tobacco, especially the smell which stains the clothes. When I went to family restaurant with my friends before, a customer who sat the next table smoked all the time. We usually sit a nonsmoking seat, but at that time there were no seat except a seat in the smoking section. So we were no choice but sitting a seat in the smoking section. The people who want to sit the nonsmoking seat always wait their turn , because the number of nonsmoking seat is as same as that of the seat in the smoking section. If the number of the seat in the smoking section decrease or vanish, waiting time would be lessen. The customer who wants to smoke may get angry, but such people should put up with smoking when they are eating dinner. But if the restaurant which have only the seat in the smoking section , or smoking restaurant is built , a lot of smokers would come and become popular.
