 I think it is not important for college students to have a part-time job because it is important for them to learn a specialized field. And they should spend longer time to understand it deeply. Making Money should be done after they graduate from the college.

 

 Generally, itÅfs a difficult task that college students keep up both their school work and a part-time job. If they devote their college life to a part-time job, they will neglect their school work. The students who neglect it in their college life will be at a loss in the future. Of course, having a part-time job has the advantage of getting many opportunities to meet people from different fields. They also can experience many things by working. So, if they kept up both studies and a part-time job, they would live a full college life more.

 

 To tell the truth, I donÅft have a part-time job now. So I have more free time than other students who are busy for their working. I often spent my spare time in going to the library in my college and reading the books which interest me. The books owned by the college are treasures for me because they are not seen in a usual book store or the library in my neighborhood. By reading them, I have been acquiring special knowledge little by little. I think this experience seems to be more valuable than one by working when IÅfm a college student. Once we start to work in the society after graduating from a college, we no longer have a long time for learning unknown things or interesting things. I think that spending as long time as we can to learn interesting fields is one of the most important college studentsÅf rights.
