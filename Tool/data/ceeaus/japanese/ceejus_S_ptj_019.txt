I think part time job is important to college students. There are two reasons why I think that. First, college students may have many free times. Because they have no needs to study hard like high school students. And, because they have no needs to work like adults. Of cause they have many choices to use their free time. They can use their free time to play with their friends, to go shopping, to study what they are interested in, and so on. That is important but donÅft forget that we will be adults and should make our lives by ourselves. Ordinary way to make our lives is to work. So before we need to work, we should experience many work. There are many work in our society, and we may not know so much about work. If we experienced part time job now, we might get many knowledge about some work. And that knowledge will help us when we need to determine our work.
Second, part time job will give us many chances to get friends. Those friends are not only college students, but also adults, high school students, and so on. We can get many friends in part time job.
As there two reasons, I think part time job is important for us, college students.
