I agree the idea that it is important for college students to do a part time job. Why I think so?
First, I think the part time job teaches them what working is like. In these days, young people who do not feel like working Å\ generally, they are called ÅhNEETÅh Å\ are increasing in Japan. It is a serious problem. If they know what working is like and wonderfulness of earning money of working, ÅgNEETÅh will decrease in the future.
Second, doing a part time job, students can gain various experience. For example, we seldom do a clerkÅfs part. But service industry enables them to do the part, and they understand how to communicate to customers as clerks.
But, if students take too much time to do a part time job, they may ignore studying, though they are college students. So I think they must pay attention to take studying time as well as a part time job time.
Although I state several opinions about students doing a part time job, I have never done the job. But at some point in time, I would like to do the job because I think I would be better off experience many things.
