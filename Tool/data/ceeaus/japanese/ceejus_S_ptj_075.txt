"I agree with this statement, and there are some reasons. First of all,
many college students need some money to enjoy their school life. Not
only playing with their friends but also paying tuition fee.
Second, when we become college students, it is the time to get ready to
become an adult. And I think that part-time job plays an important role
in that step. Through this activity, we learn many important things. For
example, attitude, manner, responsibility, and so on. Of course it also
tells us the difficulty of earning money.
And they are all necessary to become a member of the whole world. Also
this means that children become independent from their parents.
Of course, I have part-time job, and I feel that I could grow up through
this job.
Finally, if college students donÅft have part-time job, there are too
much time left. Someone may say that they can study many things because
they have much time. But, I donÅft think so. Of course some students do
so. But most of them may just play with their friend whole time. And
soon, life style gets worse and worse.
Because of these factors, I agree with the importance of part-time job
for college students. And I think it is more important to try many kinds
of part-time job."
