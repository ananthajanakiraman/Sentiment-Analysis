"I agree with this statement.

There are some reasons as ground for my opinion.

 

One reason is that college students who have part-time job can experience Åeworking adultÅf.

In the future, almost all the college students must work in society, and display their ability with all their strength, have responsibility for what they do all.

But, in this state of conditions, if there isnÅft any opportunity for making preparation to enter the society, they will be less likely to adapt themselves to society.

So, having part-time job is need. By doing this, they can develop themselves for their future.

 

Second reason is that by having part-time job, college student can money for their own purpose some freely.

Before they have part-time job, they accept money from their parents.

Of course, It is said that they independent from their parents.

And so, when they use money for their own purpose and pleasure, there is limitation in amount of money for use and they usually feel guilty.

So having part-time job is need. By doing this, they come close to the state of self-support, and get the chance of controlling a use of money by themselves.

 

Last reason is that by doing this, they can become acquainted with other people newly.

To encounter other people bring us much profit. Person who they meet in part time job is sometimes important friend throughout their life.

Getting this chance is very essential and delightful.

Considering these ideas, I agree this statement.
