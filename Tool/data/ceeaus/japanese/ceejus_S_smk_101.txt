All the restaurants should stop customers from smoking. There are some reasons for this. 

 First, smoking has already banned at many stations, schools, and hospitals, where a lot of people come.
This is because the smoke causes very harmful effect on the health.
For example, it could make it easy to have some cancer.
Moreover, the effect is not only on people who smoke but also on people who donÅft smoke, so restaurants have to protect this people from the smoke.

 Second, smoke prevents customers from enjoying dishes. 
Many customers donÅft come just because they want to make their stomach full.
They also come there in order to enjoy the taste and the good smell of the dish, but if someone start smoking in the restaurant, the restaurant become full of the bad smell of the smoke, so the good smell of the dish would disappear. Moreover, people who donÅft like the smoke feel really uncomfortable. 
Like this, many people canÅft become relaxed because of the smoke.

 Third, if all restaurants in Japan begin to ban smoking, the number of people who smoke would decrease, because they feel that it is more difficult to find the place where they can smoke than now.

 As I said, all the restaurants should decide to ban smoking as fast as possible.
