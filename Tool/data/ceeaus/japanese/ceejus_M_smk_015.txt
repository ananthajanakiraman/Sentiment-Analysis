I agree the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.

There are three reasons why I think smoking should be completely controlled.

First, smoking is very harmful for smoking people themselves.
Smoking people have high risks of disease such as lung cancer, larynx cancer.
If pregnant mother smokes, her baby smokes, too. Then, the baby get same risk.

Second, smoking also does harm to non-smoking people.
We call this problem Ågpassive smokingÅh.
Even if we donÅft smoke (and hate smoking), we are snuffing smoke coming from tobacco.
Smoking people smoke through filters, but other people inhale directly.
Passive smoking has a risk to the health of the people who have been troubled with asthma.
I am suffering from asthma, so I wonÅft inhale smoke of tobacco in the restaurants.

Third, smoking during the meal is rude for cooks of the restaurant.
Long time habits of smoking take away smokersÅf normal taste.
Cooks want guests to eat their great dishes deliciously, but they will be disappointed if guests smoke during the dinner.

Many smokers (like my father) canÅft stop smoking despite their will.
So, I think society should deprive them of their smoking opportunity.
