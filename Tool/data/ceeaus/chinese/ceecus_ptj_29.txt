I think it is not very important for college students to have a part-time job.
First, the most important duty of students is to learn knowledge. We go to school for knowledge, isnÅft it? If we have a part-job, maybe it will have a bad influence on our study. Because part-time job will spend some pieces of time. Second, what can we get from a part-time job? I think most people will say ,money and experience. Yeah, we can get experience, but the studentsÅf work in school also can give us that. I think the only reason of a part-time job is money. If you are quite lack of money, youÅfd better to have one. If you just want to have a try, maybe one time is enough.
To most of students, a part-time job is a tool to earn money, but I think in this time, the most important thing is to improve ourselves, to get knowledge and make friends with our schoolmates, but not to make ourselves rich. However, maybe this is different in different countries. 
So, I think, it is not very important for college students to have a part-time job.
