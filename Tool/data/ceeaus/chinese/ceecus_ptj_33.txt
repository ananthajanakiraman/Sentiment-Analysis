In my opinion, It is important for college students to have a part-time job.
For college students there is much spare time。It is unreasonable for them to use all their spare time on playing games especially computer games。
It is sensible to have a part time job for college students。For one thing，having a part time job can help us know more about our society。We can learn a lot from our part time job，such as how to communicate with others well and what we need that can help us do the work well。All of this，you can not learn when you always stay at campus and read your books。For another thing，having a part time job can keep us healthy。Why？now students’ mental health is becoming a problem。Students often feel lonely if they have nothing to do expect for studying。They will become ill in mental easily if they can not manage time well。Having a part time job is a good idea because it can enrich our spare time。Finally having a part time job can help us make some money so that we will not have to depend on our parents for living expense .even we can pay tuition fee by ourselves .
Having a part time can make our college live more brilliant.
