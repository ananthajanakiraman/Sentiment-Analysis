There are still so many people discussing about this topic whether it is important for a collage student to find a part-job.    
Because in some peopleÅfs opinion, the students who have find a fit job can alleviate the financial burden on the family. But the others think it is a waste of time to do so, because studentsÅf most important duty is study. They should care there expertise first.
My view is that it free for the collage students whether they should do so. It depends on studentsÅf self-condition. At first time limit is a big problem in front of the part-job. Because some studentsÅf courses need a lot of time to study, such as languages. It is not reality for them to find a part-job. Then some of the studentsÅfs family conditions are not good enough to supply their live. So it is necessary for them to find a job so that they can live better and mitigate their parentÅfs pressure. The last point, there are still so many students who both have time and a good live condition and they also  want to improve themselves .so they could do a part-job to promote their ability and social experience.  
Some people say that the times of university is the best in a personÅfs whole life. So we should plan well and enjoy the youth with the whole heart.
