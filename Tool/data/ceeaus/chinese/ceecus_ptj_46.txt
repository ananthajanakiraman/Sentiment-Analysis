When asked about it id important for college students to have a part-time job.Å@Some people disagree this view. They think a part-time job waste many time for students to study at school.Å@Another people hold this view .
    In my opinion, I believe it is important for college students to have a part-time job. This reasons for my choice are listed as follows. In the first place, with the development of society, company need a experienced employer. But college students lack a practice when they graduated from school. At college they learn acknowledge is not useful to future work..It is not link to work. They find it is very difficult to find a job. In the second place, college students have a pare-time job could get some money to reduce family pressure. They could learn the values of money when they get money by yourself. They will cherish money because of they find it is not easy to get money.
    Though the above analysis. I think college students will be benefit from a part-time job. Whatever effects it has, one thing is certain, it have more positive effects than negative effects to college students. In a word, a part-time will help college students to have a chance to practice and have a better future.
