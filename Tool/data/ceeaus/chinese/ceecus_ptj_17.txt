Now many college students have part-time job .I think it is important for us because we can not only learn at school . We must go out of school to know other things that we can not learn from school . Part-time job is the good way to do this .From part-time job we can learn the way   to communicate with others ,not just with classmates . From part-time job we can know many people who maybe can help ourselves at other way .From part-time job we also can learn the difficult that happens in the future . Although part-time job maybe can costs our study time , it is worth to do this ,I think . What is more , Part-time job also can help the student whose family have not much money to support a student to go to college . Doing a part-time job can make some money to support the study . I did a part-time job last term and it helped me much, not for the money but the experience that can help me all the time between my college time so I think a part-time job is important for college students . All above is my opinion . That is all .
