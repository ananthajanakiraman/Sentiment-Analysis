 Now more and more people smoking in public,I think it doesnÅft only influence the smokers,but also have a strong impact on the other peopleÅfs healthy.So,I think smoking must be completely banned in China especially at all the restaurants.
  Now let us have a conjecture,you are having dinner with your friends at a good restaurant.You are happily eating and chatting with each other.Then suddenly,you smell the unpleasant smell of cigarette,and then,when you eat your food,you will feel bad and canÅft swallow it only because the smoke is so strong.I think you must not be happy any more.So,I must tell the people who smoke at restaurants can you stop smoking at public for the purpose of themselves and others.
   Think of this matter from the angle of the doctors,smoke have a very bad influence on peopleÅfs trachea,when human are eating,their tracheas are expanding,if breathe much smoke at this time,people are very easy to have tracheitis, bronchitis and other diseases like these.
   In a word,smoking is bad for peopleÅfs healthy,smoking at restaurants is worse.Now,in China,this matter is very serious,so,we must help ourselves,when we see others smoking at restaurants,we should put a stop to them.
