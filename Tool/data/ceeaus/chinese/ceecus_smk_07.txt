As everyone knows, cigarette is not perfect goods for people's health. However, many people smoke in a few places, for example bars or restaurant, where they will have an effective communication.
I do think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China. The most important reason is that it does make other people ill because they are breathing it in and smoking can deeply damage peopleÅfs health even if they donÅft smoke.
Firstly, smoking is the main reason for cancers. The more people smoke the shorter the can live. It could say smoking is the chief criminal of goods which will kill people. Secondly, it is also damage people who donÅft smoke. Restaurants are public place where full of people who donÅft smoke such as children and the old. If someone smokes at the restaurant, it actually changes the atmosphere of those places. No doubt smoking is very danger to our body, and especially it is more harmful to them who donÅft smoke but breathing smoke in.   
In a condition it is a must to completely ban smoking at all the restaurants in China for us and our next generation.
