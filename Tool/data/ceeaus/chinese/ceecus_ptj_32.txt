I donÅft think it is very important for our college students to have a part-time job. Part-time job, in my opinion ,is just one of the small pieces in college life, maybe it helps us to know how difficult it is to make a life in modern life, and make us work hard. but it also waste a lot of our time, which should be used in studying. 
Our parents live a hard life to offer tuition fee to us, so we have the duty to do our work well. ItÅfs true that college is the place for us to enjoy our lives, we canÅft spend all our youth to study, we can take part in many activities to make new friends, and take a job. But we should never forget that study should always come first. Without good results, nothing is meaningful. 
I canÅft deny all the students who take part-time jobs. The students whose family havenÅft got the ability to offer the tuition had to work to continue his study. But the students whose families have enough money for you to use should focus your attention on study. Now even you go to find a job, without technology, you can only find a low income job, which have nothing to do with what you have learned.
