Many people think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job, because the students can not only earn money by themselves but also can learn something which they couldnÅft learn in the school. At the same time some other people insist that students should stay in the school to study the knowledge. 
In my opinion, I agree that the students in college should have a part-time job. Because there is more knowledge which can not be learned from the textbooks. If a student wants to fail less, then what he needs is not only the knowledge which he learns from schools. Maybe study the knowledge from the books well is important, but the knowledge which can be learned from the society is necessary. Some people may think that it is a waste to have a part-time job for the college students. However, if a student only knows the knowledge that he learns from the books, he may lost more in the future.
