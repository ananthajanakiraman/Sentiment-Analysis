Different people hold different views on part-time jobs for college students. Although more and more people focus their attention on part-time jobs, I donÅft think we should do part-time jobs in college.
We fell happy and proud that we go to the colleges we have long been dreaming for after great efforts. However we are faced with more challenges. The subjects we study are not easy to grasp. We also need to develop social relationships. Still, we need to take part in many competitions. Moreover, there are quite a lot of books lying in the library we need to go though. It is really a great opportunity for us to develop ourselves in all aspects. We are supplied with so many chances that we have no time to do part-time jobs. It would be better that we go out when we graduate.
In conclusion, we should cherish the golden time in college for self-learning and self-developing. What the most important is that we would better keep busy every minute to make each day count in order to fulfill our dream and contribute to our society better. So do not do things that distract our attention from studying. Make better use of every day to make ourselves more and more independent powerful.
