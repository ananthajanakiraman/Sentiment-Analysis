It is important for college students to have a part-time job
I do agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
Lack of money may be the most import reason for us college students to search for a part-time job as we knew. For some students it is the part-time job that provides them with the fundamental cost of living. And it will make it possible to start a life without parentsÅf financial aid although we should have been self-reliable in as an adult. It is true that thinking of the hardship we will consider fully before we spend the money made by ourselves.
Moreover, as college students, aside from academic knowledge, we should gain more experience through those part-time job. I had a part-time job of teaching a high school student math one year ago. At weekends, I should wake up early to take the first bus while my roommates were enjoying the beautiful dreams. But being paid for 30 RMB per hour, I did obtain a sense of achievements through this part-time job. I think what we gain through part-time jobs is not only the money but also the particular experience after hard working.
I think the college life will lack color if we live out four years in college without doing a part-time job.
