In my opinion, it is not important for college students to have a part-time job.
Firstly , Chinese students are always busy with their studies. Even though they have gone to college , they still have many lessons. A part-time job will take our time that should be used for studying. We may not do our homework well. So, it begins at the wrong end. 
Secondly, a part-time job will cost the physical power. If we are tired, we may fall asleep easily on class. Over fatigue are not only bad for our study, but also bad for our health.
Thirdly, if we have a part-time job, we may see many new people and many different things. All these will hold our mind. Even on class, our mind may sneak away.
Of course many people think that part-time jobs can make college students become independent, strengthen our communication ability. But, whenever, the good score is the precondition for a good job.
So if we really want to experience a part-time job, it is better to wait until we turn to grade four, when we are not busy with studying any more.
