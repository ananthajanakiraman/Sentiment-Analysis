In my opinion, all restaurants in China should not completely ban smoking. Instead, it is necessary for most restaurants to set a smoking area to serve smokers and other restaurants to completely ban smoking. Although the majority of people support the assertion that smoking is harmful to smokers and people near them, in reality, there are still great amount of people in China who are smokers. Once all restaurants begin to ban smoking, smokers cannot stand the period in restaurants without any cigarettes. As a result, it is possible that large groups of heavy smokers give up to eat in restaurants and instead begin to eat at home or buy fast food, which will course great reduction of restaurantsÅf profits. Thus to look round the corner, it is reasonable for restaurants to divide themselves into smoking area and non-smoking area, then smokers could enjoy their cigarettes after finishing their delicious dinner without complaint from non-smokers while non-smokers could appreciate their dinner without smoky air. As I know, the ÅgShow CoffeeÅh is among those restaurants which first begin to set smoking area and non-smoking area in China, which is largely welcomed by its customers. In addition, there are special restaurants with limited room for the division of different areas. Under this situation, all the customersÅf health is much more important that the smokersÅf addiction, so runners of those restaurants should completely ban smoking without any hesitation.
