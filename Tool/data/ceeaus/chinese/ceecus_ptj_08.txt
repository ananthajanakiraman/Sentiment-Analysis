 I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
 I think the part-time job is necessary for college students to have more chance to know the situation of themselves. If a college student only at school learns the knowledge he has to learn, he will never know the difficulty they would be in when they are in society.
 There is a large number of students donÅft know the hardness of earning money. They use money without self-control. The money is from their parents, college students without their work they donÅft how much have to pay to earn money. If they have a part-time job, they will know the hardness of earning money, how much have to pay to earn money.
  There are also many studentsÅf families are not so rich for them to go to college in China now.  The paid for go to college is a huge burden for their families. If they can have part-time jobs to earn money in the spare time of their studies, it will let their parents to feel more releasable. Also it can make many students to have more extra money to buy what they like.
  For those reasons, I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
