 I donÅft agree the statement that smoking should be completely banned at the restaurants in China.
 IÅfm not a smoker, and I donÅft like people smoking around me. But I still donÅft think it is not a good idea to completely forbid people smoking at the restaurants in China. 
On one hand, smoking is not forbidden by the whole society. All the countries have no such laws that completely forbidding smoking. Though nicotine makes people get addicted, making people die earlier. This is quite similar as drugs. The reason that tobacco has never been banned is that great amount of taxes are paid by the smokers and tobacco companies. This has been a important part of all the tax income to the governments. 
So rights are given to the people. Smoking is not about affecting people nearby, itÅfs more like a right of freedom and fairness. Since governments never banned smoking, in my opinion, dividing guests into smoking area and non-smoking area at the restaurants would be a great idea for now. 
But I am looking forward to the day that all tobacco is forbidden all over the world, not only in Chinese restaurants.
