Should smoking be completely banned at all the restaurants in China? Many people think so, I think it is a very realistic problem. As we all know, smoking is bad to our health. WhatÅfs more, it`s influence people around you. Restaurants is a place that you should pay attention to your behavior and manner very well. So from this point, smoking should be banned in the restaurants.
But in the other hand, however, don`t think so. Some people feel that smoking shouldn`t be banned at the restaurants. In fact, it is a complicated thing. We cannot lightly say ÅgshouldÅh or ÅgshouldnÅftÅh. It influenced by many factors, first of all, it is difficult for government to control smoking people`s quantity. And if there has supplies, there has needs. If smoking is not be allowed in the restaurants, what will the people who really want to smoking do?
In case of myself, I think instead of smoking in our own seats, the restaurants should make some special places for us to smoking. It will not only good for smokers, but also the others. However, it`s easier said than done. Only in reality we van know whether it is good or bad.
