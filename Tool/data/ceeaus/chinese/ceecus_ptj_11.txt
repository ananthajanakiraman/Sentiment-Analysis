ItÅfs more and more popular for college students to take a part-time job nowadays. Personally I think it is important to do so.
   First of all, taking a part-time job teaches us to be thrifty. As we can see, most of the college students tend to luxurious now. They buy clothes with famous brand which are quite expensive. I admit expensive clothes usually have good quality, but too expensive with famous brand ic unnecessary. While most of them seek for the famous brand rather than good quality . So itÅfs important to learn to be thrifty for us. Secondly, taking a part-time job can give us some good experience which will help us to get used to society. Though we have many activities in college, thatÅfs different from society after all . I took a part-time job as a waitress in a restaurant last term. I must be patient and considerate to all kinds of people. I also need to make the tables clean after they had meals. I learned hoe to hold dishes when I served them to the customs and many things else. I stopped the job because itÅfs a little tired and I was busy afterwards. But itÅfs a good experience. It taught me to be tolerant when getting along with people. Another thing is that taking a part-time job helps us earn some money. It can lighten the burden of our family, especially for the poor ones. 
     There are also many other advantages of part-time job, such as broadening our knowledge, strengthening our body and so on. So I think itÅfs important for college students to take a part-time job.
