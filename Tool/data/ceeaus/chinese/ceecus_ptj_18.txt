Should students do a part-time job or not differs from different students in different countries.
Of course ,doing a part-time job is good for students to build more abilities not only about the knowledge in the textbook. But for me, I donÅft think is good to do the part-time jobs. I have got a lot to do within my lessons, I really have no more time to spend on other jobs, even though I know it clearly that doing such a job is good to me. If I spend my time that should be spent doing my lessons, I think the result would be that neither I learn what I should learn in the textbook, and neither will I gin a ability that should be built by doing the part-time job, because I canÅft do the two things with my full heart.]
  So if you have a lot of free time I suggest you to do a part-time job, selecting a job that fit to you is very important, in my opinion the best is the ones have confections with your subject in school.
If you really have got a lot of works to deal with, itÅfs better to spend all your efforts in your own studying, not even thinking about searching a part-time job, for that you can learn most things in the shortest time in school,  at least I think so.
