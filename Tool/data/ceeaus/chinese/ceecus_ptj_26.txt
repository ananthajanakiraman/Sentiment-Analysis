  As a matter of fact, IÅfm just doing a part time job as a fraulein now at weekends. I also get some money from it and feel very happy, because it is the first money I got by myself. As a fraulein, I must face with many kinds of people. I think it is the thing that is impossible to avoid.
  But in China, there are very little part time jobs for our students. I know, in Japan, university students can do part time jobs not only as a fraulein but also as a waiter, a librarian, even a cook and so on. I think it is the reason why the students in Japan are morn self-support than our Chinese students. In China, many students donÅft want to do part time jobs because they think it can make them lose countenance. But I donÅft think so. I think do part time jobs can make our students step into the society, then we will know the importance of study. Knowledge can make us richer than only do jobs with our hands.
  So I think do part time jobs are very necessary for our university students. I also want to do many kinds of part time jobs to make myself much stronger.
