Is it a good thing for college students to work part-time jobs? I think there are many advantages for college students to have part-time jobs.
Many teachers complain that there are fewer and fewer students who pay attention to their study because of part-time jobs. But in my opinion, students can choose to take up a part-time job according to their own situation. As we know, college students have fewer subjects and less pressure than high school. They have more time to do things they like. Having a part-time job is not a bad idea I think. Taking a part-time job has lots of advantages for college students. Firstly, part-time job offer them opportunities to apply what they have learned in school and demonstrate their abilities. Secondly, students can make some money through the part-time job, and it enables them to be more independent of their family and builds up their self-confidence. Thirdly, part-time experiences may be of great help to their future careers. Finally, part-time jobs can broaden their college lives and help them know more of themselves and society. 
But the more important thing for them is to keep a good balance between part-time job and their study.
On the condition, I agree with the opinion that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
