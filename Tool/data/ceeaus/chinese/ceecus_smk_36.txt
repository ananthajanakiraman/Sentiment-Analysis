I agree with the statement that the smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China.I have some 
reasons and specific details to support my answer.
  In my opinion, smoking at restaurants is doing more harm than good. On the one hand, smoking is bad for our health. Moreover, if you smoking at the restaurants, it not only does harm to your body,but also has bad effects on other's health. On another hands, smoking will give off a large amount of poisonous gas which will pollute the fresh air. Especially, at the restaurants is impossible for the gas to get through. So smoking at the restaurants causes more harms than at outside. In addition, smoking is a waste of money that we can use for some meaningful things.
   I also think that carrying out the statement is of benefit to us. It is helpful to build up our bodies, so that we can live a healthy life. Besides,it is also contributed to improve quality the of the restaurant' air, which will bring a refreshing environment for people who have dinner at restaurants. What's more, it helps us to develop good and healthy habits.
   In one word,the statement that smoking should be completely banned at restaurants in China is necessary for us. If it will be carried out ,I will do my best to support it. That' all.
