I donÅft agree with the statement that itÅfs important for a college student to have a part-time job. It is not a matter of money, but a matter of ability. Being an 18 or 19-year-old student, the knowledge we have gained from their study already enables us to take in some kinds of work, such as being a private teacher, a waiter and so on. What we are lack of is the opportunities to develop or practice our potential. Only by having a try, can we really get more experiences that will assess us in the future job. , And a part-time job offers us such a valuable stage.
 Since we have been a college student, study should not fill our life as usual, we have so much spare time that we should make full use of them to do some meaningful things, and a part-work is a good choice. 
 By making money by ourselves, will we value our parentsÅf endeavor more, and be confident and independent more, no matter we are in a rich family or poor. Also, though the social practice, what we get is not only money, but another fresh attitude towards the society and work, which we can never learn from any book.
ThereÅfs no doubt that we will encounter a lot of difficulties in the part-time job, for example, how to balance the time between study and work, at the beginning maybe itÅfs a problem, but as time goes on, you can be a master of time, you will be more and more efficient, which is really important in our high-speed developing society.
All in all, a part-time job is really of great importance.
