I donÅft think part-time job is important in college life. 
First of all, as being a college student, we still have lots to learn and we have no idea what we are capable of. Because of this, we usually choose very simple and meaningless part-time jobs like waiters and cleansers. Truly we can earn some small pocket money through these jobs, but in the same time, the precious time that we lost just equals the value. In order to spare the time, I prefer to make a good use of the library which is definitely great treasure for us and we very likely wonÅft be able to have access to the large amount of knowledge any more. So why donÅft we treasure the time and the utilities now, so that we can arm ourselves with broad sight and knowledge.
 About the working experience or the society experience, I think these are ought to be realized after graduation for we have plenty of time to deal with the society, like 5 decades or even more. IÅfm sure that at that moment, we must be very tired of work and always like to looking back to our campus life which should be pure, full of activities and enjoyment, maybe piles of books we have read which brings us wisdom, or maybe an unforgettable girlfriend or boyfriend. Whatever it is, it will never be the job. 
Compared with the work time, school time is so short, I hope I can enjoy my school life to the largest extent and leave no regret!
