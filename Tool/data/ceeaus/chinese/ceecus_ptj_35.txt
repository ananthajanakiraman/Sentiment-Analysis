At present, more and more university students are doing part-time jobs, they work as family tutors, waiters, salesmen and so on. Like everything else, having a part-time have both favorable and unfavorable aspects.
The advantages can be listed as follows. First, through have a part-time job the students can have the chance of earning pocket money and this can reduce their parentsÅf financial burden. In addition, they can put what they have experience and get to know the society. For example, they can learn to get along with people. ThatÅfs canÅft be learnt from books.
   But every coin has two sides, the disadvantages of having a part-time job are also apparent. some students think that Part-time job may take up too much time and energy, and may influence their study.
  As to me, I believe the positive aspects outweigh the negative ones, because when we are college students, we have much time which can be used by ourselves, I think have a part-time job will more useful then to use this time to sleep or play computer games. Also the experience which have through the part-time job will be very useful when we enter in the society.
Therefore, students can benefit from their part-time job so long as they can keep a good balance between study and work.
