It is fairly well that smoking in the restaurant is a bad behave which harms both the health of the smoker and others in the restaurant. But from my point of view, forbid it completely is impossible.
  Suppose smoking is completely banned at all in the restaurant people may smoke outside it and then get into. Then the provisions will with no meaning.
  It is well known that even though the tax of cigarettes is very high, the number of people who smoke is still very high. Therefore, forbidding smoking in all the restaurant is not a fundamental method to make people away from cigarettes.
  Moreover, the restaurants in china are of different levels. And people in china also have different level of education. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in China, there will be a lot of people who canÅft understand it and it will also have a bad influence on those small restaurants.
  Considering the possible consequence above, I think it is reasonable to forbid smoking in high-grade restaurants, but forbidding smoking in all the restaurants at all is unrealistic and not feasible.
