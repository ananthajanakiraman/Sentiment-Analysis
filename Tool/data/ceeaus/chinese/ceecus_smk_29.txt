As everyone knows ,smoking isnÅft good to our health ,so dose smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants ?
It is said that smoking is harmful not only to our health but also to the air. Smoking can lead to many diseases, such as lung cancer. Smoking affects non smokers more than it does smokers. According to a survey, the rate of passive smokers getting ill is higher than that of smokers. So, many nonsmokers are against smoking.
     In restaurants, the harm of smoking is greater. ItÅfs not only bad to themselves and worse to others but also it pollutes environment by giving much poisonous gas off  into the air.
    Therefore, that the government ban smoking is very necessary and important to us. It is a measure to protect our health and environment. So many people, especially nonsmokers are for the policy.
Some people may say that it takes away some of their freedom. I think it is a one-sided view. If one wants to smoke, he may smoke in private, not in the restaurants. In fact, smokers still have the freedom of smoking.
     But, I think, smokers had better give up smoking, not only in private places, but also everywhere. It will be beneficial to all of us.
