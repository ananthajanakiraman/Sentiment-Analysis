Recently, I found some people are discussing warmly on weather it is important for college student to have a part-time job. Someone think it is a waste of time for student who should spend much of in studying while some believe that it is a good chance for student to get the knowledge on how to earn money and how to live in the society which they have to learn when they leave school.
  To my point of view, it is important for college student to have a part-time job. First of all, it is a good chance for student raise their ability of living in the society. As we all know, during the recent years, it is hard for some student who just left school to find a good job since the company do not admit they ability by a piece of paper since the education system is not trustful. At this time, if they show something they got in the part-time job, it would be very useful for them. Meanwhile, as a college student myself, I find that we have a lot of spare time after finishing the courses required, the part-time job in spare time can enlarge our abilities of communication, teamwork spirit and so on.
  However, we should have a clear mind on the priority, as a student, the first mission is learning, part-time job can help us a lot, but if you failed a lot, you will still face many problems,. Beyond this, pay more attention with the contract when you what to sign in a part-time job.
