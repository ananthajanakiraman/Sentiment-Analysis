Some people maintain that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China. In their opinion, smoking is harmful not only to the smokers but also to the people around. WhatÅfs more, smoking is a waste of money, because of no advantage. When one smokes a cigarette, one is actually burning money.
The smokers do not agree. They believe that smoking can helps to sharpen their mind and prevents one from sleeping, especially when they are working on a hard work. Also, the government gets lots of money from cigarette taxes, and these money can help us to make our country better.
I am not a smoker, and I donÅft like smoking very much. But, I argue that the smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants. ItÅfs not realistic for preventing every smoker from smoking. As we all known, everyone has his right to choose the style of life by himself. And, of course, no one has the right to impose his way on other people. So, in my view, the smoking should be banned in all the restaurants but not completely. In other words, we should give multiple choices to persons. In some areas of restaurants smoking should be allowed, and if you are not a smoker or you donÅft like smoking, you can choose the no-smoke-area of restaurants.
