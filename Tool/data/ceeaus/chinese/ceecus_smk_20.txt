As the level of our lives becoming higher, we have more chances to patronize restaurants, cheap or expensive. At restaurants, itÅfs not difficult to find people having dinner during smoking. People just like me who disgusts with smoking   are always choked by the smoke. So I support that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China, if there are no special areas in restaurants for smokers.
          Not only because that I dislike smoking but also because that this action may leave a bad memory on tourists form foreign countries. As china is becoming a international country, especially after we holding the Olympic games successfully, we should pay more attention to our activities not to lose face for our grand country. WhatÅfs more, itÅfs a bad habit to smoke over a dinner for it will has a bad effect on your somatic and nervous system.
      All in all ,I believe that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China.
