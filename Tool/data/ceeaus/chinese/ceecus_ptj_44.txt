It is important for college students to have a part-time job 
  Being college students means we are not children any more and we already have the ability to support ourselves. However,  infact , almost everyone of us students in China  depends on our parents which leads to a phenomenon that parents work hard and children play hard.
  In my opinion, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. not only can we enjoy the pleasure of earning money, but we can get to know the hardship of life so that we can hard work and appreciate it. Beside, having a part-job can provide us a chance to acquaint ourselves with society.
  Nevertheless, there are also many persons standing for the idea that a part-time job is a waste of time because studying is the important  job for a student. For this ,I have to say they are wrong .Taking a job is not a waste of time ,on the contrary ,it can teach us how to use time in a proper way.
  We may meet a lot of problem while doing the job .That is not the problem. For all pain helps to make us rise, however much we may hate it at the time What is more, we are young and we have the courage to conquer them. The job may bring us more pains than happiness, but it is really a treasure that will bring us more opportunities in the future. We have to pay the price if we want to win.
  In a word, we can benefit a lot from a part-time job. Please remember the sentence: Knowledge comes from experience alone.
