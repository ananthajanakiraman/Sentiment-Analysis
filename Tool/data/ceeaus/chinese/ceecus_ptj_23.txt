I think，as a university student ，if we have the chance，we should take a part-time job。The reasons are as follows。
Firstly ，we can earn some money so that parents` burden can be reduced 。Though it is not too much ，our parents can know that we understand their pressure and that we are trying our best to do all that we can 。our parents will feel happy to see this。
Secondly，if we work as a teacher in your part-time job ，we can review what we have learned。Our students and we ourselves can promote at the same time ，which we may be not realize until we have made progress obviously。
Thirdly，we can get the ability to communicate with people in society，which is very important when we work in companies in future 。since we are students，we get along only with students every day。As a result ，when many graduates enter the society ，they cannot adjust to the difficulties and challenges at the beginning ，but if we have taken part-time jobs ，maybe it can be avoided。
However，many students hold the opinion that taking a part-time job may waste our time ，As a students，what is the most important is studying，we can earn money after we have graduated。In my opinion，taking a part-time job does not mean that we are wasting our studying time 。Because it depends on the way you arrange your time 。As a college student ，we should have the ability to make our time to be full used。
Certainly，everyone has their own opinion on the topic，just do what you think is right.
