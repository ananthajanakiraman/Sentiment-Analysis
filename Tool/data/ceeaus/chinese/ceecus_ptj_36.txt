There is a general debate on the campus recently over the phenomenon of college students` doing a part-time job, which also has been widely concerned by the public.
Without any doubt, engaging in a part-time job will goes a long way to college students who have been educated by Chinese style education and have narrow knowledge of the society.
The majority of the students believe that by taking a part-time job they can not only improve their academic studies but also gain much experience such as interpersonal skills which may put them in a favorable position in the future job markets.
And in my opinion a proper part-time job would not occupy students too much time. In the other hand spending all the time on study in the room is not a wise choice. The last but not the most important, college students should have the conscious of relieving the pressure of family .Of course doing a part-time job is the best way.
Everything has both positive and negative aspects, and students` doing a part-time job is of no exception. There is some students canÅft manage time well and that will cause problems of filature in concentrating on study. Another serious resistance is that most parents think the society today is too complicated for the college students to adjust to and what is more, we may be cheated. So I suggest that the government should set out a series of laws to norm the part-time job markets and to protect students rights. 
From what has been discussed above, I draw a conclusion that part-job ,which seems not the most proper and reasonable nowadays ,can product many benefits to college students and our future, should be encouraged.
