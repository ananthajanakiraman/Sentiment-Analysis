 I donÅft agree with the statement.
  Firstly, I think it is impossible to make everyone not smoke at all the restaurants in China. Because there were too many restaurants in China.
  Secondly, I think it is not necessary to ban people to smoke at all the restaurants. 
  If we donÅft want to make others smoke the second-hand smoke, we can make no-smoking place for them to go. 
  As there are so many people in China, it is difficult to practice the rule. 
  But I think we can change the rule into another way. We can ask people to smoke at smoking rooms. 
  Comparing with banning smoking at restaurants, I think it is better to tell smokers how bad it is to smoke and make themselves stop smoking.
  So I donÅft agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China.
