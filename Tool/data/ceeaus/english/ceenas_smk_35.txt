ÅgSmoking should be banned in all restaurants in the countryÅh, is a strong but true statement. This statement shows that the government is taking an active role in the health and welfare of the community. Restaurants where smoking is allowed create a toxic environment for their customers, as well as staff members who inhale the fumes all day. It is commonly known that cigarettes cause cancer and it is well known that the damage to the lungs of secondhand smokers is often severe, if not fatal. This law will encourage smokers to smoke outside in open areas or reduce their smoking. 
The average time spent in a restaurant is one hour. This is a reasonable amount of time for a smoker to smoke beforehand and refrain from smoking while in the restaurant. However If they choose to leave earlier, there will be more seats available to other customers, thus increasing the chances of profit for the restaurant owner. Smoking restrictions are one way for the government to protect itself from future lawsuits due to secondhand smoke. However, the best way to reduce the number of deaths due to smoking is a serious campaign to educate people on the direct impact cigarette smoke has on their lives and the lives of their families. This is especially true for families with children.
