I strongly believe that itÅfs important for all students to have a part-time job. The main reason for this is that I believe students can gain a lot of valuable life experience and preparation for life after graduation through entering the workforce prior to their graduation.
Many recently-graduated students are woefully unprepared for the realities and responsibilities of full-time employment. This can be particularly true for university students. The nature of university life is such that one can become used to staying up late at night, sleeping in late, neglecting their commitments (i.e., classes), with little or no immediate repercussions. As a result, it can often be difficult for students to make the necessary lifestyle adjustment upon graduation and subsequent employment. A part-time job, undertaken while still pursuing one's studies, can be quite helpful in this regard.
Maintaining a part-time job while studying can also be a valuable exercise in personal financial management. Many recent graduates similarly have difficulty in managing their finances responsibly. In many western countries, this unfortunate reality often combines with high levels of debt (on credit cards, student loans, etc.) to leave many recent graduates in grave financial peril. A part-time job can help by not only providing experience in managing personal cash flow, but also provide at least a small amount of income with which to counter such debts.
A part-time job is a very good idea for students.
