I believe that smoking should be banned in all restaurants throughout Japan. I have three reasons to support my position. Firstly, regarding the health of customers, more and more compelling evidence suggests that the ingestion of second-hand smoke is a direct cause of various lung disorders, predominant of which is lung cancer. Any steps that can be taken to reduce this risk should be taken by any civilized nation. Japan is by and large a socialist nation, where the good of the many is the concern of the individual; sickness and lack of public health simply undermines the health of the body-politic, which is illogical and self-defeating. Secondly, regarding the health of restaurant staff, second-hand smoke creates an unhealthy working environment. I believe that every individual has the right to work in a safe and healthy work-place. Banning smoking will remove the dangers inherent to second-hand smoke from negatively effecting employees. Finally, there is the issue of social acceptance of smoking, or rather lack thereof. A restaurant, or restaurant chain, that bans smoking on its premises sends out a message to society in general: that smoking is unacceptable in the presence of non-smokers, of whom there are more and more in the light of recent shifts in medical awareness and social health. Therefore, for these reasons, smoking should be banned in all restaurants.
