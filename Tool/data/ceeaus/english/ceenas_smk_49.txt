Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. We must respect and take care not to bother others in order to live peacefully in this society. This is the basis for my argument for the total and complete prohibition of smoking in any public space. How can one go out and expect to enjoy oneself if he is subjected to various disturbances? Imagine that you are watching a movie at a cinema and the people in front of you start commenting on everything that happens. Would this not ruin the effect of the movie? Next, you are on a long flight and the child sitting behind you starts kicking your chair? So, how can anyone enjoy the taste of the delicious food on their lips when it is overwhelmed by the rancid taste of tobacco? You cannot have a smoking section at a restaurant, because that is like having a peeing section in a swimming pool.
Smokers are decreasing as new concrete data is coming out which clearly shows the connection between cigarette smoking and various ailments. For this reason, it is my belief that this dying breed should respect all non-smokers and not subject us to the dangerous consequences of being around cigarette smoke.
