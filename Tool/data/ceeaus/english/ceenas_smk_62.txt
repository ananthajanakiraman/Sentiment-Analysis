I disagree that smoking should be banned from all restaurants in the country.
	Firstly, it is not illegal to smoke cigarettes. These days the places allotted for cigarette smoking is being reduced all the time. Even smoking outside is banned in some areas leaving people who want a smoke with nowhere to go. Since smoking is an addiction and people are going to smoke one way or another, it is better to designate an area for people with similar tastes rather than to force them to take drastic measures. A restaurant that banned smoking would find cigarettes blocking up their bathroom toilets with the smell of smoke there as well. Since both non-smokers and smokers both use the bathroom there is a chance of losing the non-smoking patrons due to stinky bathrooms.
	Secondly, smoking is one of the last good population control tools legally permitted and actually advertized. With global warming and world over population and with the advances in medical technology, if we donÅft leave a few deadly vices for people to do themselves in with, we may find ourselves going to restaurants and not finding any food left.
	So build a wall, put in a glass partition and let the cool people have their smoked dinners.
