I disagree with the opinion that smoking should be completely banned from all restaurants in the country. Why do I hold such an opinion in todayÅfs age of scientific proof that so clearly shows how harmful second hand smoke is to others? First of all, I think that restaurant owners should have the same rights as home owners and be able to allow whomever they wish into their stores. If I want to allow someone to smoke in my house, I can. If you donÅft like the smoke, then you are free to leave. That same freedom should apply to the people that have paid their hard earned money to buy and set up their own business. Secondly, there are thousands of restaurants out there that cater to the many tastes, desires and needs of a very picky public. How is a restaurant that caters to the smoker crowd any different? Smoking in a public place like a bank or work office is clearly a different matter and I agree that smoking should be banned in these areas. However, restaurants are privately owned establishments and are not providing a necessary public service at a location which we must visit. This gives us the choice or the freedom to enter or not enter and gives the restaurant owners the freedom to operate their establishments as smoking, which I do believe is still legal, or non-smoking. NobodyÅfs rights are being violated as long as we all still have a choice. Banning smoking in all restaurants is clearly such a violation.
