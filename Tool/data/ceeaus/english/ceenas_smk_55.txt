The statement that smoking should be banned in all restaurants is a good policy in theory, but in reality there are many people who go to restaurants to enjoy smoking and drinking while eating. Theses people make up a significant customer base for the food and beverage industry. I think that what law makers should do is pass the responsibility of protecting nonsmoking customers onto the restaurant owners. One way to do this is by charging higher taxes to restaurants with poor ventilation systems or without a barrier separation between smoking and nonsmoking sections. I believe that if the restaurant has taken reasonable steps to separate the smokers from non-smokers, then they have done their job to make sure that all customers have a comfortable dining experience. Instead of banning smoking, another way to stem the smoking vs. nonsmoking controversy is to increase in the number of non-smoking restaurants and cafes.  At this time many popular cafes, such as Starbucks have had tremendous success with promoting a smoke free environment inside the cafe. As the nonsmoking culture becomes increasingly popular, smokers will find a ways to curb their smoking appetites while dining. Overall, the best way to solve this situation is to give customers a choice.
