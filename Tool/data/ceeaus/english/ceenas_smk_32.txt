I strongly agree with this statement, I will explain in these following three reasons.
 
Reason one, with the scientific proof that smoking causes harm to those who smoke and even more so to those around them I donÅft believe smoking should even be legal. In todayÅfs society and the lengths people go to keep fit and healthy it is beyond me why some people continue to smoke.

Reason two, because of the health effects smoking has on people I think it should be the choice of each individual person to whether or not they wish to inhale. As with todayÅfs current laws they often do not. There has been an improvement in the seating arrangements in restaurants with the separation of smokers and non-smokers. Still the smell often travels around the restaurant as the ventilation is not always one hundred percent perfect. Or if for example customers must walk through the smoking area to get to the bathroom. The popular drinks bar may be situated in or right next to the designated smoking area.
Reason three, the enjoyment of a restaurant experience can be greatly affected by just one smoker lighting up. Some Japanese smokers light up even before they have finished their meal. If a person is sitting at the same table or counter seating the smell while they are trying to take in the full flavor, sites and smells maybe put them off their meal.
So in conclusion the health benefits and enjoyment value of not smoking at all in Japanese restaurants people would be much better off.
