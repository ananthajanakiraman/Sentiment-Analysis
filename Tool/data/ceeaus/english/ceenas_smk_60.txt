I would disagree with the above statement for the following reasons: Loss of income for restaurant owners and the rights of smokers.
If smoking was to be banned in all restaurants in Japan, it would have a major impact on many businesses which would lead to some of them closing down.  I have read that Japan has impressive statistics with the number of restaurants in the country; there is a restaurant for every group of 85 people.  Some argue that it is okay to partition off a restaurant into smoking and non-smoking areas, however a lot of restaurants are too small to be able to achieve this.  In some countries of Europe, a smoking ban was enforced in restaurants and bars.  One year later, it was widely reported that many businesses had suffered due to the ban. Without a doubt it will have the same effect here in Japan.
Recently in Japan, the rights of smokers have diminished in many places around the country.
JR West railways has allowed smoking at only selected areas of the platform, a city ward in Tokyo has completely banned smoking within its boundary, Midosuji Boulevard from Yodoyabashi to Honmachi is strictly non-smoking and many offices now ban smoking within the building.  If restaurants are included in this ban, IÅfm sure that many small restaurant owners in order for them to survive will turn a blind eye to their customers smoking and risk breaking the law.
