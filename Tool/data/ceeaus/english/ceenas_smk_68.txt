I disagree with this opinion. Our freedom of choice is really whatÅfs at the basis of this argument. Are we really a free society where each individual is guaranteed the right to choose where he or she will dine or smoke? Or, must government come down to the level of infringing upon our rights and make the choice for us? Are we adults here or not? The point is that if government decides that it must interfere with our liberties to the point of deciding upon which restaurants can operate and which cannot based solely on whether smoking is banned or not, then where is the stopping place for government interference? Will they next be telling us which wash room to use, or which house to purchase? Where does the infringement on individual liberties and government intervention cease? The point is if people know full well that smoking is going on in a restaurant they would like to eat in then let them complain to the owner(s) and let the owner decide if he wants to ban smoking at his/her establishment or not. True capitalism and liberties will regulate themselves without government interference. If a business owner is losing more customers because he allows smoking then let him change his policy, and if customers donÅft like being in smoke filled restaurants then let them go elsewhere. This is what true freedom is all about; allowing for personal choices on all levels of society.
