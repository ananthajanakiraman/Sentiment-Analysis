College students should not work while they are in school for several reasons.  First, it is difficult to focus, second, it takes time away from studies, and third, sometimes a part-time job can lead to other paths which are distracting to the path of a degree which was original goal.
If a student decides to work part time, the student will have additional responsibilities that will deter a student from the focus.  If a student is to excel, he/she will need to put all energies into creating an environment that is conducive to a good study.  It is the first time in a young students life, the student makes decisions as open as going to class or doing homework.  Failure is a much larger possibility than in high school because at this point in a students life, the administration is treating them as an adult. Consequently, a job poses a threat.  Money is quite a distracter
Secondly, time from studies is the most important element in success at school.  If a student takes on a heavy load the true determination of a students boils down to time management. Every hour is either spend studying, sleeping, going to class and having fun.  The college experience is about networking, meeting people, learning and essentially getting good grades and landing a good job in his/her field.  
Finally, if a student is ideal for a position in a part time job, the employer might want to give the student additional responsibilities.  If given a choice between money and classes, many people especially early on in oneÅfs life would choose money. It is after all, the reason we are in school; to earn a degree and ultimately get a job.  College should be a time for studies not for distracting part time jobs.
