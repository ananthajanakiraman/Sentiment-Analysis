I agree that is indeed important for college students to have a part-time job, for several reasons.  First, having a part-time job helps teach students how to use their time wisely.  20 hours per week working, by definition, reduces study time by 20 hours.  Thus, students begin to learn the value of using time wisely.  On a personal note, I worked on and off throughout college.  Interestingly, I got better grades when I had a part-time job.  I focused better, exercised greater discipline and worked harder in the available study time that I had.  

Secondly, having a part-time helps defray the ever-increasing tuition costs.  Many college students rely on loans to help afford college.  After college debt creates stress and burdens that newly minted graduates could well live without.  Reducing (or in some cases eliminating) loans reduce debt, leaving the graduates in a better financial and mental state.

Finally, part-time jobs often expose students to the greater population at large.  Working in a restaurant, for instance, brings students in contact from those of all walks of life.  Whether learning from fellow employees or the myriad of customers, learning takes placeÅcwhich is why students go to college in the first place, isnÅft it?
