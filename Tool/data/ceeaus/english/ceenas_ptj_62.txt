I disagree that it is important for college students to have a part time job. Assuming that the student is diligent and studying for a career job, having to worry about finances would be added stress. If their parents are willing to invest the money to help pay the studentÅfs living expenses, hopefully the student will respond by studying hard to make his/her parents proud. It can be plainly seen that students that work part time will have less time to study as well and their focus will always be divided between the classroom and the part time job. Troubles at the part time job may cause the student to miss class or perhaps even lose complete sight of the goals that were once established when applying for college. My brother dropped out of Northeastern University in Massachusetts after double majoring in physics and history only to continue working at Disney world following a summer breakÅfs working holiday. Money is often wasted and it can take more time to graduate since taking a full load of classes and working part time can be often difficult. Also the chances for the student doing part time jobs to use their money to enjoy college life more such as partying and drinking can lead to other more serious problems. A budgeted amount of money from the studentÅfs parents could stem much of the partying funds.
