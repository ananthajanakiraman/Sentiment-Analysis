It is very important for college students to have part-time jobs. Part-time jobs provide much needed income for needy students and families who face financial difficulties. Incomes from such jobs help students not only buy food and basic necessities, they also help students purchase books and educational materials they would otherwise not be able to afford.  Part-time jobs also help students  appreciate the value of money; students come to realize that earning money demands hard work, dedication and discipline. This will change their attitude towards spending, and especially towards unreasonable spending. Additionally, part- time jobs assist  students to recognize the inherent social hierarchies in the work force. These structures that exist in the work force are very different from what students experience at school. Early appreciation of the levels and hierarchies will help students understand the work environment much better when they start formal full-time jobs, and thereby adjust to the expectations faster and easier.  Finally, part-time jobs demand involvement in society; they provide effective preparation for transition from the academic world to the real world.  There is no doubt that part-time jobs provide students with invaluable experiences. Both private and public companies should do their utmost to offer part-time jobs to students.
