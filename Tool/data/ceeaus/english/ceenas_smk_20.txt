I agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in Japan.  The primary reason for this is consideration for non-smokers and their health, especially those with asthma or allergies.  These are people who are more susceptible to the harmful effects of inhaling secondary smoke, which exacerbates asthma and allergy symptoms. They should not be involuntarily subjected to conditions where smokers pollute the environment, particularly in public places where you have to pay to be served.  The secondary reason is consideration for children and the elderly who dine at restaurants.  They, too, should not have to eat their meals in such conditions because their health is more fragile.  Also, the smell of cigarette smoke sticks to oneÅfs clothing and belongings ? whether he smokes or not ? and is difficult to remove.  This may be a minor issue but it is unfair that one has to suffer from such inconvenience just because a public place freely accommodates smokers.  Smokers have the right to enjoy their cigarettes, as it is a personal choice.  But they have to acknowledge that by smoking in a public place like restaurants, they not only make the air unclean, but also encroach on the rights of others; namely, that of enjoying their meal in a public space which presents no hazard to their health.  Even if smokers are aware of the negative effects of smoking on their own health, they should be considerate of their surroundings and the hazards they present when other people inhale secondary smoke.
