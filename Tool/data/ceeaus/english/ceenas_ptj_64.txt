 Advising college students to sacrifice what little available time they possess away from their studies in the pursuit of MammonÅfs glittering bounty is both wrong-headed and short-sighted. Anyone who has ever known a university or college student appreciates the focus and dedication they bring to the acquisition of a diploma. Interrupting this headlong charge for enlightenment is the work of demons, for what does it profit a man to gain extra pocket money only to lose his bursary? (Beware those who extol the virtues of labour! Their day of reckoning shall come, and that right soon!) The modern student should spend every waking hour digesting the great dollops of nourishing scholarship fed them by active and concerned teaching assistants. Without concentrated thought, how is newly coined wisdom to be dispensed and mastered. If dollar signs are dancing in the studentÅfs head, if raw cupidity corrupts his soul, if contemplating materialist purchases disturbs the studentÅfs mental growth, what point learning anything? Disrupting this evolving relationship with academic study by saddling the questing student with some menial, minimum wage drudgery, by interfering with the ceaseless cogitation that is a studentÅfs meet and proper burden within all institutions of higher learning, one embraces an obscene perversion of all that is holy and right about advanced education. Never! Again, I say never! To the carrels, where we shall make our stand for undivided attention to our studies across these, our new barricades. And let the so-called ÅgGreat WorksÅhÅ\rightly unread due to their relentless racism and misogynyÅ\be our cobblestones. Students of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your loans!
