I disagree with this position. First of all, I disagree on the grounds that there is no clear reason to pick on smokers. We smokers do not live in denial of scientific facts, we readily accept that smoking is not a healthy habit (it causes all sorts of lung and respiratory ailments). We are constantly reminded at work and at home that we should quit, preventing us from smoking with our afternoon coffee seems simply petty. I say this as I watch the person at the table next to me (on the other side of the glass wall now used to segregate the smokers) gulp down a massive steak dinner along with a few beersÅc I guess IÅfd feel better if government went after overeating and overdrinking with the same enthusiasm as they seem to exhibit when persecuting smokers! An finally, IÅfm certainly not happy with the idea that smoking is bad for everybody (non-smokers included). I own a gun and like to go hunting, IÅfm very careful about not harming anyone in the process. I behave the same way when it comes to smoking: I make sure that my smoke does not bother anyoneÅc If only other smokers were the same way, this would not be such a problem!
