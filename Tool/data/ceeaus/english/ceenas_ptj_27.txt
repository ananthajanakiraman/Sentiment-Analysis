    I believe it is important for college students to have a part-time job because it teaches responsibility and it helps students to develop stronger social skills. 
     When a student has a part time job, she must learn to be on time, appropriately dressed, and ready to work hard to do the job right.  If she is not able to do these things, there are real consequences to her actions.  She may lose some of her pay, or even lose her job.  It is better for her to practice these skills in a part-time job during college than to wait until after graduation to make naive mistakes  in a job that is critical for her future career.
     Another important point in favor of part-time jobs is that they give students an opportunity to meet a  wider variety of people.  Most young people only really know other young people from their school and their family.  For many college students, the situation is the same.  They know  their classmates, teachers, and family, but maybe not too many others.  Having a part-time job in college may be  the  first chance for students to learn to work together as a team with people who are very different from them in age, ability, or way of thinking about the world.  This environment is much closer to what they will experience as adults.
     All people when they enter the work force need to be able to manage themselves and to  get along with their co-workers.  It is my belief that part-time jobs give students valuable training in how to do this well.
