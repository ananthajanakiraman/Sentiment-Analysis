I strongly agree with a complete ban on smoking in all restaurants throughout Japan. There are four reasons for this. Firstly, smoking is bad for health. It is now commonly accepted throughout the world that smoking is bad for health. Smoking is not only extremely detrimental to the health of the actual smoker, but more importantly it is now generally agreed that the effects of passive smoking are equally damaging. A meal in a good restaurant should be a leisurely experience, and can often last for two or three hours. Non-smokers dining in restaurants or bars should not have to endure the effects of breathing other peopleÅfs smoke for long periods. In addition, staff at restaurants work long hours, sometimes in very enclosed spaces. Being able to work in a healthy environment is a basic right. Secondly, children should not be unnecessarily exposed to the bad habits of adults. Children are a regular sight at popular restaurants throughout Japan, especially on weekends. Tobacco is not only unhealthy, but it is also an age-restricted product. Having smokers sitting at the next table sends the wrong signal to children. Thirdly, smoking affects the taste of oneÅfs food. One of the pleasures of dining out is experiencing tastes and smells of foods that one might not otherwise eat. When we ÅetasteÅf food, we are experiencing a combination of sensory signals from both the mouth and nose. The smell of cigarette smoke can change the taste of some foods. Many restaurant managers worry that banning smoking will affect business, however statistics from cities in Europe and the US reveal that there has been no significant loss of business since a blanket ban on smoking was introduced. For these reasons, I fully support a ban on smoking in restaurants.
