There should be total ban on smoking in all public places, including restaurants. Going to restaurants is both a pleasure and a necessary activity for many people. Why should non-smokers be subjected to second-hand smoking, to its negative effects or to its bad smell if they are in a restaurant enjoying their meals? Why should we allow their pleasure to be spoiled by the selfishness of a smoker puffing smoke into the air? Non-smokers have the same basic rights as smokers. These rights should be upheld and respected. It is a proven fact that smoking can cause various maladies; these maladies range from simple problems such as tooth cavities to a far more complicated malady such as lung cancer. We should therefore protect the right and the health of non- smokers. Protecting the non-smokers from the dangers of second-hand smoke has noticeable financial implications as well. Second- hand smoke exposes the victim to a wide range of diseases resulting from nicotine. A major part of governments' health budget is dedicated to curing smoking related diseases. Once the dangers of second hand smoking are totally abolished, there would be a noticeable decrease in diseases as well as a huge saving in governments' health budgets. It is beyond doubt that there should be a ban on smoking in restaurants.
