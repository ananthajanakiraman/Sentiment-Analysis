Should all students have a part-time job? The answer to this question is subjective?it depends on the student. A blanket, yes-or-no answer would overlook the various relevant factors in a studentÅfs life that are different from case to case.
These factors include, but are not limited to: the need for income (for tuition, school supplies, living expenses, etc.), the probable impact on the studentÅfs available time and energy level (and the resulting reduction of their effectiveness in studying and completing assignments), as well as the relevance of the job in question to their field of study.
Considerations pertaining to the first of these factors are fairly straightforward?the student either requires additional income to support their education, or they do not. The importance of a job rises and falls in relation to the level of this need.
The second factor, by nature, would never increase the importance of having a job, but could increase the importance of not having one. If the demands of a job are too great (relative to the ability of the student to cope with them in addition to their scholastic responsibilities), then they should not keep the job.
The last factor is the most complicated. It requires a determination on the part of the student as to whether or not they stand to gain any professional benefit from a particular job. For example, working in a convenience store would be of little use to an engineering student, but may be of some educational value to someone studying business management.
Each student must weigh these factors and decide whether a part-time job is important or not based on the particulars of their own situation.
