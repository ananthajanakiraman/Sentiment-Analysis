In my opinion, it is not necessarily important for college students to have a part job but it may be beneficial. There are many points that that could be made for either side of the argument, but in the end unless finances are a major concern, then the decision of whether a college student takes on a part time job or not is up to the individual. Some benefits that may come from a part time job are the attainment of work experience and the development of organizational and social skills. Such skills are necessary for success both in the future workplace of the students and socially. 
	While the range of part time jobs available to current students may consist mainly of fast food or manual labor positions, finding a job related to oneÅfs area of study would provide invaluable experience and insight into a studentÅfs targeted career.
	Even if they are unable to obtain a job related to their area of study or to their desired future career, any type of job should help in the development of the studentÅfs organizational and social skills. Balancing work schedules with class schedules, managing their income and arranging time for studying and social activities should help improve a studentÅfs time management, financial planning and effective study skills. Such skills will show immediate benefits as they should assist the individual in becoming a more productive student. 
	In conclusion, working a part time job may not be financially necessary for many students, but the opportunity to obtain skills and experience that will assist them in their daily lives both presently and in the future, as well as help prepare them for car post graduation careers is one that should not be passed up.
