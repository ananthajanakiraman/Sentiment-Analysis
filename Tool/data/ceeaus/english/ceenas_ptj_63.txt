I disagree with this statement because I think that college students should spend all of their time studying and not worrying about other things. When we graduate from College we will be able to work for around 40 years so I think we should concentrate 100% on school. Too many College students spend their time working and then this distracts them from doing homework or going home at a reasonable time. If we do part-time jobs then we will start to earn money. When we earn money we can buy things and go out to restaurants with our friends whenever we want. This could easily turn into a vicious circle and before we know it, the part-time work has become more important than college and studying. Students should postpone entering the Ågreal worldÅh until they graduate fully from College. There are too many distractions when we start to work part-time jobs. These experiences can only have a negative influence on young people. I think that any free time that college students may have after they have finished studying should be spent with their families. College students should be taught how to do housework and chores so when they leave home and live by themselves it wonÅft be a problem. Governments should place a ban on employers who employ people who are still in further education.
