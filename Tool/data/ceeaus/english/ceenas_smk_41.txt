I agree with this opinion. I have three reasons. First, all non smokers are paying customers and have the right to enjoy their meal in a smoke free environment. It is still unfair to non smokers in restaurants offering a smoking section. If the restaurant is small, you can still smell the smoke. Customers would have a hard time to enjoy the flavour and aroma of the food they are trying to eat. Second, servers could enjoy working without the dangerous effects of second hand smoke. Apparently, if a server worked ten years in a smoking environment, the probability of developing cancer is much higher than a smoker. It would be a shame to leave a workplace with a chronic disease while you were only trying to make a living. Third, restaurateurs could enjoy lower insurance premiums due to less liability from no smoking in the establishments. The probability of a fire due to a customerÅfs negligence is eliminated. Therefore, restaurateurs could have more available funds to operate or promote the establishment. This may begin a trend in other establishments such as bars and nightclubs who may also benefit from lowered insurance premiums. Based on the above reasons, I support the opinion. This is fighting for the rights of non smokers and employees of restaurants.
