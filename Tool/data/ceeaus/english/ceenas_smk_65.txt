I disagree that smoking should be banned in restaurants. Firstly, a restaurant is a public place. People go there at their own choosing. It is not fair to ban smoking in restaurants while continuing to allow it in bars or nightclubs, concert halls or train stations. Secondly, many restaurants are already catering to the needs of both smokers and non-smokers. There are separate smoking sections provided, or partitioned seating, and companies have spent large sums of money on ventilation systems to remove the smoke. Restaurant owners are voluntarily doing this to satisfy both groups of customers. It is not necessary for the government to be creating more laws or restricting peopleÅfs recreational activities. Secondly, banning smoking is bad for business. Many restaurant managers and owners are already struggling to stay in business due to the current economic crisis. They feel that banning smoking will scare away valuable customers, and that it will be difficult to survive. Additionally, some do not have the space to partition separate seating, or the money to invest in expensive ventilation equipment. Thirdly, there are thousands of restaurants in every large city in Japan, catering to all tastes and varieties of cuisine. People are more than capable of selecting a restaurant that either welcomes smokers, or alternatively provides a non-smoking environment. It is a basic right to be able to smoke if one chooses, and for these reasons I do not agree with a blanket ban on smoking in restaurants.
