I disagree with this statement.  The main problem here is that of ÅetimeÅf which most students would argue they have not enough of, particularly towards the final years of their study when workloads become extremely high in volume.  There are simply not enough hours in the day for a student to attend lessons, complete all of their assignments, and then work a shift afterwards.  The expression Åehealthy body, healthy mindÅf rings true here ? how can a student be expected to perform at the necessary level required by tertiary education when they are fatigued from over-exertion, or in some cases unable to engage in physical activity because they have no time?  Generally, most students have 2 free days at the weekend in which they have availability for part-time work but this negates the entire purpose of a 5-day week which is to rest.  For those with a 6 day study week the problem is compounded and that single free day is absolutely required for relaxation purposes.   
Furthermore, student life is the last chance a person may have to experience freedom in terms of responsibility.  While there is certainly responsibility to be held with regards to their study, they are rarely relied upon by anyone else as people are in professional careers.  The last few years before entering their careers is their best chance to have fun so they should be able to utilize any free time they have pursuing their recreational habits with the limited time they have.  Obliging a student to spend their free time working instead of enjoying life can have a detrimental effect on their outlook,  and may lead to feelings of frustration, depression, or even pessimism.
