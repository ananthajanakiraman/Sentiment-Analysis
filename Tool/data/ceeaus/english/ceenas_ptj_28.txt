I agree with this statement. I believe that parents and universities should recognize this need for the good of society as a whole. 

For some college students it is necessary to have a part time job for financial reasons. It is important that universities consider this fact when setting course work, and should try to be flexible with lectures, meetings and such. Otherwise students from poorer families will be at a disadvantage compared to those whose parents can support them through university.

I believe, however, that it is important not only for poor college students, but for all college students to work. It is common for people from wealthy families to pass through school, then university, and into high positions in society without ever experiencing regular work. Such people do not have empathy for the majority of workers because they have never been in such positions themselves. This situation is common in modern society, not only in companies, but also in politics, medicine, law and the academic world. 

In the interests of social balance and justice I believe all college students should spend some time working in regular jobs. Universities could award credits to students who do volunteer work, or who have part time jobs in areas relevant to their subject of study. These things are important to the all-round development of the students, and therefore should count towards their degrees.
