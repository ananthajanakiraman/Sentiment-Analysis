I believe that smoking should be banned in all restaurants. There are so many good arguments for implementing such a policy that they cannot all be examined here. 
The first, and most obvious, is that concerning the health of restaurant patrons. Principally, we must consider the potential negative health effects of second-hand smoke for those restaurant patrons who are non-smokers. They have made the wise choice to refrain from taking up smoking, and should not be forced to compromise their potential health and well-being simply because others have not made similarly wise choices regarding their own lifestyles. At the same time, we would do well to consider the effects of a smoking ban on the health of smokers, as well. These individuals cannot, of course, be forced to quit smoking entirely--as they are within their rights to smoke, if they wish to do so--but it is, nonetheless, the responsibility of the government to discourage smoking. Therefore, a smoking ban in restaurants would be good for smokers as well. It would force them to smoke less, and possibly even encourage them to give up smoking entirely.
Perhaps most importantly, there is also the health of restaurant employees to be taken into account. These employees may or may not be smokers themselves, but regardless, their health is, perhaps, the most at risk of all (due to the relatively large amount of time they spend in a smoke-filled environment). 
	The potential benefits of this policy for the public at large cannot be ignored. In addition to the health factor itself, there would be an additional, long-term, beneficial impact on the national healthcare system as less and less people are forced to seek treatment for tobacco-related illnesses.
In all, there are far more reasons for banning smoking in restaurants than there against.
