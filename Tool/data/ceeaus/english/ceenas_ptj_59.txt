. I disagree because training is needed to do any jobs properly. Training requires time and is costly in terms of economic resources. To spend time and other resources to train a worker who is doing it on a temporary basis with no guarantee on his pursuit of the same job later in his life is a complete waste of time and resources.  Any part time job creates a distraction for the student. Students should focus on their studies. University studies lay the foundation for a successful career later in life. In certain cases a part time job may force a student to forgo a class or it may make him physically tired. Any forms of exhaustion interferes with the academic ability and ultimately the success of students. Furthermore, the concept of offering jobs to students should be weighed very carefully especially in this economic crisis, against job possibilities for other people in the general economy. There are many full time workers, middle aged people, married couples and even elderly people who are heavily in debt, severely short of any income and out of  jobs who need some income just to meet the very basic needs and to cover expenses of the daily life. Jobs should be offered to the groups who are more in need rather than students who may not be so disparate for an income.
