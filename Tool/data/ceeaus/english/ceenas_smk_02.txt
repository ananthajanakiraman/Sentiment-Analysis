I strongly believe that smoking should be banned at all restaurants. Restaurants are places where families take time to have a nice meal without exposing themselves to the risk of getting cancer, asthma and other respiratory problems. The children are the worst sufferers of the ill effects of smoking. Smoking alone kills thousands of people every year and makes hundreds of them sick. It should be banned because nowadays it seems like everywhere you go someone is always smoking. Inside the restaurants, breathing smoke causes loss of appetite and it smells bad too.

In a free society like Japan every individual has a right to choose to do what they want even if it means some harm to their own health. Nothing can justify interference in personal choice but is it justified enough that the right of an individual to smoke can affect other people's lives? However there is a moral justification to the interference of theÅ@society -to make people aware  and guide them to make the right choices, therefore the warnings and the campaigns to ban smoking are perfectly justified.

Another reason to ban smoking is passive smoking which is like inhaling a second hand smoke- breathing smoke does affect a person's health. People, who smoke, unknowingly are affecting the health of the people they even don't know. Banning smoking within the premise is a rational approach since the health of the employee is more important relative to the rights (or choices) of customers. 

Many countries like UK and parts of US have already banned smoking so why not Japan, which is a health conscious country and definitely wants healthy citizens. In conclusion, I think there is a reasonable justification for banning smoking in all restaurants despite of the fact that it means infringement of the rights people.
