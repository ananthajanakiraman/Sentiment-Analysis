I disagree with this opinion and feel that holding a part-time job during oneÅfs college days will negatively impact long term goals. In todayÅfs world obtaining a college education has become much more competitive than in times past. In our fatherÅfs and grandfatherÅfs generations a man could have less than a high school education and still find sufficient work to supply a modest income supporting a family of five, purchase a home, and allow his wife the freedom of staying home and carrying for his children. Those days are long past and with the entrance of more women into the work-force coupled with the ever increasing costs of living it has become near impossible to adequately support a small family without obtaining a minimum of a four-year degree. Should a young man or woman have to spend time during their college days holding down a part-time job this will only distract from their efforts of fully dedicating themselves to study. Achieving high marks in their courses should be the primary goal during this critical period of their education. Therefore, time devoted purely to study should be safe-guarded to the maximum and not diluted with worries or schedules associated with having to obtain and hold-down a part-time job.
