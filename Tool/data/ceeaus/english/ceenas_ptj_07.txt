I believe that working during school builds valuable skills, encourages students to have a financial stake in their education, and prepares them for the real world they will encounter after college.

ThereÅfre countless skills that can be acquired from any part-time job. The most readily apparent skills have to do with balancing school work and the responsibilities of one's job. Skills like prioritization, multitasking, and balancing responsibilities are all important to finding success as an adult, and working while going to college provides the perfect training ground to improve these skills.

Too often the financial burden of a college education is supported entirely by a student's parents, with the consequence that students have little concept of the actual cost of their education. Without a financial "stake" in the true cost of their education, students often
don't place the importance in their studies that they would were the fees for classes coming out of their own pockets. That is where a part-time job can help, by allowing students to contribute more to the cost of their education, and by giving them a better understanding of the value of money by having to earn it themselves.

Many students find it difficult to transition from the world of the college campus to the work world following graduation. College campuses are unique environments where the passion for learning and discovery are cultivated. ItÅfs very important that colleges continue
to maintain this environment where one can explore talents and interests to the full extent of one's abilities without worrying about whether course work can translate directly into a salable product. However, part-time jobs, particularly ones directly related to one's field of study, are very important to expose students, even if only partially, to the work world that awaits them after graduation.
