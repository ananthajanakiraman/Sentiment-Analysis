I disagree with this statement, however it's context must first be made clear. The statement can be divided into two separate arguments; firstly, is the purpose of banning smoking in restaurants to promote the comfort and health of non-smoking diners, or is it second, to reduce the total number of smokers in Japan? 
Despite proven health risks, smoking is still very popular amongst all ages because it is a highly social pastime and over time, has become deeply integrated into social etiquette. With regard to both arguments, banning smoking in all restaurants will improve the comfort of non-smoking customers and may help reduce the chance of passively contracting a smoking related illness later in life, but it is perhaps too severe on customers who choose to smoke and on restaurants' business. The immediate effect of banning smoking would significantly reduce the total number of customers at restaurants and consequently damage their profits heavily. A better approach, would be to introduce smoking and non-smoking sections in restaurants, or to segregate smoking and non-smoking restaurants altogether. This would give customers the freedom to choose an environment which suits them, whilst allowing businesses to succeed financially.
Finally, with regard to the second argument, reducing the number of smokers in Japan needs to be brought about gradually, by improving health education and changing social pressures, not solely by banning smoking in all restaurants.
