Smoking should not be banned in all restaurants in Japan. This would be an infringement on the freedoms of both Japanese citizens and restaurant proprietors.
It is true that smoking cigarettes is bad for a personÅfs health, yet this point is irrelevant from a business perspective. Citizens are free to make their own decision about whether or not to smoke, and likewise, are free to choose which restaurants they wish to dine at. Restaurant owners are not obligated to allow their patrons to smoke in their establishments, and should not be so. By the same token, they should not be obliged to forbid smoking, either. 
As long as both citizens and firms are given the freedom to make their own decisions regarding smoking policy (whether it be personal policy or business policy), then both smokers and non-smokers alike can obtain a dining experience that is suitable to them. Inevitably, while many restaurants will choose to provide a smoking section, many will also opt not to. Market forces will dictate the number of firms choosing each course of action.
Indeed, this is already true in Japan today? not all restaurants are uniformly smoking or non-smoking. Rather, they choose the policy that best suits their market. This way, all customers can be satisfied simply by choosing a restaurant that has the policy of their choice.
If the government wishes to reduce the number of smokers in Japan, it has many policy options available to it. Raising tobacco taxes, for example, would be a far more effective way of discouraging Japanese citizens from smoking. If policies such as this were utilized, and the number of smokers thereby decreased, then market forces would, in turn, push firms to adopt non-smoking policies in their establishments, without the need for direct government interference.
