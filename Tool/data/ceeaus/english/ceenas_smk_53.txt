I agree with this statement for a several reasons, perhaps not the ones you think though. Everyone already knows about the health hazards of smoking, but apart from educating the population, thereÅfs little you can do if people really want to do themselves harm (people drink too much at parties, itÅfs terrible for your health but no one is banning that!). IÅfd ban smoking in restaurants for the same reason that drinking & driving is banned: YouÅfre not only endangering yourself, youÅfre also endangering others whoÅfve made a decision not to indulge in the same risky behavior (and may not enjoy being put at risk by you!). Of course this isnÅft the only reason. IÅfm also pretty upset by the fact that smokers tend to pressure others into allowing them to smoke. I went to a cafe with a friend the other day and this friend is a smoker. Since we were only sitting down for a cup of coffee, and since my friend would have clearly found it distressing to have a cup of coffee and NOT smoke, I was persuaded to sit in the smoking section. IÅfm sure IÅfm not the only one in this situation. Essentially, the urge to smoke is very strong, stronger obviously in most cases than the urge to stay away from cigarette smoke. So in the end, itÅfs not only that smokers need to be encouraged to stop smoking, itÅfs also that non-smokers need a bit of help in saying no to their smoking friends!
