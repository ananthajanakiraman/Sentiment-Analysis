Although I dislike tobacco use in all its forms and fully recognize the dangers of both first and second-hand smoking to the health of all members of society, I simply cannot support a complete smoking ban in all restaurants within this country. 

Unlike a hospital or a school where people for one reason or another are compelled to be in a specific location, entering a restaurant is entirely the choice of the individual.  If the restaurant is a smoking establishment and this is not acceptable, a person has only to choose to eat elsewhere.  Tobacco is still a legal product in Japan and therefore smokers as well  as non-smokers should have the right to go to certain places where they can relax and enjoy a meal without judgment. 

Furthermore, for many smokers tobacco is not a nasty habit, but rather an addiction.  Banning smoking from all restaurants will not cause people who need help to stop smoking, It will simply hide the problem further from public sight.  Such a ban has the potential to cause people to feel isolated and humiliated because of their addiction.  Successful programs like Alcoholics Anonymous show us that it is not this kind of shaming, but rather connection to others and positive support that are the keys to recovery for people struggling with overcoming addiction.

Since this ban would infringe upon personal freedoms and run counter to current beliefs on how to treat addiction, I strongly disagree with implementation of such an idea.
