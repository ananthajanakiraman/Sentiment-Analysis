	I agree a smoking ban is necessary in Japan.  I understand that smokers feel they have the right to smoke because they enjoy themselves, however people who do not smoke do not enjoy breathing toxic smoke and making their clothes smell bad.   I believe the decision for the government to impose a smoking bad has done a lot to improve the lives of people by helping them cut back on smoking.  The debate is very big now because the law is new and smokers who remember life before the law preferred the way things were
            Public places need to protect the well-being of non-smokers however bars and restaurants should also be able to be able to offer sections to allow smokers to smoke and attract the customers who prefer places to smoke.  These sections need to be small and enclosed in an out of the way place with machines that can ventilate the smoke.   These enclosed areas need to be able to protect any smoke that might escape and drift into the realm of non-smokers. 
	 I applaud our government in trying to protect people, however we are also live in a capitalistic society and business is also an important concern for the well being of our people.  
 	 Governments have done a noble thing in enacting the smoking ban.  The government does also need to offer alternatives that can help to accommodate smokers for the sake of business and revenue.  Business and revenue must come second to the first priority, which is the health of the innocent who do not choose to smoke.  The government must also be consistent with its laws, or else people will not take the law seriously.
