I worked a part-time job throughout my college days and to be honest, I wish I hadnÅft. There are two main reasons I feel students should not have a part-time job in college: they get distracted and they develop bad habits. Indeed, students who have a part-time job (like I did) quickly change their perspective. Time becomes money and once you have money, you want more. Before long, these students end up working 30 or 40 hours a week and hardly have the time to make it to their classes, much less to study for their exams. Of my college days, I really only remember being tired all the time, I was always either working, trying to catch up on my class work (something which I ended up doing less and less), or out spending my money. And thatÅfs where I get to the part about the bad habits! First, poor sleeping habits: I was always working, studying or partying. But because I was so tired, I could never really enjoy any of it or get anything done properly! And then thereÅfs the spending: Some people say that part-time jobs teach you how to spend and budget: wrong! My friends and I spent on cars, fancy clothes, cigarettes, beer and nightclubs. When I finally did drop out of college and had to look for a real job, it seems that none of the employers I interviewed with cared much about my experience as a bartender, nor did my fancy clothes impress them. The lack of a degree certainly did not help either.
