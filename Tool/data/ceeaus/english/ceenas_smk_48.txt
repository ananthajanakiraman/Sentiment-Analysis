I totally agree with this opinion. Recent studies have shown that second-hand smoke is a major contributor to lung cancer and other diseases associated with tobacco and the cancerous carcinogens produced from its burning. Restaurants, though privately owned, are opened to the general public. In the case of allowing smokers to freely smoke and fill the air that is commonly breathed by all customers, smokers and non-smokers alike, restaurant owners are exposing the innocent to hazardous and life-threatening conditions. It is not sufficient to merely partition off areas for smokers when the air can freely pass throughout the establishment. In addition to exposing non-smokers to the hazards of cancer causing carcinogens restaurant owners are also bringing the foul smell of smoke filled air onto the clothing and bodies of non-smoking customers. Non-smoking customers will be forced to pay cleaning costs to rid their clothing of these foul smells. Furthermore, it has been proved that nicotine contained in tobacco has addictive properties. I suppose a case could be made that restaurants which allow smoke filled air to mingle with non-smoking customers could be accused of contributing to the non-voluntary addiction to nicotine of their non-smoking cliental. Finally, there is the issue of health costs. With the national government (Japan) bearing the largest burden of health care, allowing restaurants to continue a free smoking policy will only place a larger financial burden on all citizens, i.e. increased taxes to cover these costs.  With these potential complaints and even law-suits, not to mention the financial burden associated with increased health care costs, it seems in the best interest of all to totally ban smoking in all restaurants.
