We hope that students always have their studies as their principle concern. But, of course that's not always the case. If you are a full-time college student, then by definition you are not a full-time worker. So it follows that many may have money problems. Some are perhaps fully supported by organisations or by their families and have no need of extra income. Others, perhaps older, have saved money before their courses began. But many will fall somewhere in between and need to earn a little bit of book or pocket money. 

So, some students need money and so they get a part time job. However, what other benefits does working hold for students? It allows them to escape from the confines of the campus. To explore new worlds beyond the hard study that has brought them so far. They are young adults now and can explore all the adult world has to offer. Working part-time allows them to dip their toes into the unfathomable waters that hold the world of work, before they become fully immersed. Thereby preparing them for a world they will have to traverse for the rest of their lives. 

Wages from gainful employment hold another benefit. They offer the ability to sample the delights of the adult world. We may want students to study hard, but they want to try out things that were previously unavailable to them.

The experiences that part-time work offers are going to help young people to become fully rounded people. They will know more of life outside the academic world and they will know a little of what money can get you and what it takes to earn it. They will hopefully appreciate it if they are paying for the next round of drinks.
