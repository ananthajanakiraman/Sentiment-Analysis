Smoking will be banned in all eating and drinking establishments in Japan. ItÅfs just a matter of time. 

The tide of change started along time ago. Admittedly that tide started as a ripple on the other side of the mighty Pacific Ocean. But itÅfs building into a tsunami that will sweep the whole world. I remember reading about those crazy California health freaks banning smoking in public places at least ten years ago. I sighed when I read it, thinking to myself that people should be allowed to do as they please.  Brash loud Americans going on about their right to breath, or rather not breathe second hand smoke. It seemed so extreme. Rude and inconsiderate to the smokers. 

Years passed. 

I stopped smoking and it felt normal to be surrounded by smoke whenever I went to the pub or sat too near the smoking section in restaurants. It was however, not exactly a flavour enhancer. 

Then, three years ago, Ireland, the land that is sold around the world as a land of smoke filled pubs, banned smoking in restaurants and pubs! Scotland then the rest of the UK. Now even Holland has followed. The tide has changed and the anti smoke tsunami is now rolling across Europe towards Asia,

What effect did this have? Not much pubs are just as busy, but much more pleasant. Special covered smoking areas are located outside, with heaters for the cold winter months. Smokers have got used to it and admit that the environment is a lot more pleasant and the food tastes a lot better. So smokers have learned to adjust, businesses are not affected and they are a nicer place.  This tsunami is not bringing destruction but sweeping away the dirty, unhealthy habits of old. Eventually it will reach Japan.
