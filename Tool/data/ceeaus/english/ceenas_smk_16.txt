Smoking is a tough issue for most businesses and the government to deal with.  There are strong opinions on both sides of the matter.  But the government has made its decision.  Smoking tobacco is legal.  And while many people may not like it, everyone needs to learn to live with things they don't like in order to be a part of society.  Therefore I would not support a ban of smoking in all restaurants.
I may not like hearing the conversation of two people next to me in a train car, or even walking down the street, but I can't ban them from talking.
Tobacco smoke can be more than just an annoyance though.  To people with breathing problems or certain respiratory conditions, it can be quite harmful to breathe large amounts of any kind of smoke.  So restaurants and other public gathering places should provide separate special smoking areas.
As long as the government requires separate smoking and non-smoking areas in restaurants, everyone should be satisfied.  Some restaurants may complain or have trouble affording to build separate areas, but this is no different than requiring them to adhere to other food quality and hygiene standards, which can also be costly.
So as long as restaurants are able to provide separate smoking and non-smoking areas, there is no reason to ban smoking in all restaurants.
