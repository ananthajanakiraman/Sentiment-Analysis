I strongly agree with the above statement for a number of obvious reasons. By now we all know the facts regarding second hand smoke and the health risk that it causes to others, especially children and babies. Smokers can no longer ignore the fact that by smoking around others, smokers or non-smokers alike, they are endangering everyoneÅfs health in that enclosed PUBLIC space. Restaurants and other enclosed public places should be accessible to anyone. By allowing people to smoke there, restaurant owners and smokers themselves are taking the rights of non smokers away. I believe that all people have the right to smoke and have no problem with that. Smokers can still smoke outside (though I do wish they were more careful about where they decided to throw out their cigarette butts!), in their homes, in their cars and in many other public areas. Many restaurants have smoking sections, but they are rarely adequately sectioned off from other areas in the restaurant and the smoke inevitably bothers other patrons. Smokers are becoming a minority with the trend for a healthier public environment on the rise, and itÅfs about time that they realized, or rather that our government made them realize, that they can no longer put other peopleÅfs health at risk for their own selfish pleasure.
