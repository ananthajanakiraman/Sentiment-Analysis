I would like to be able to agree with this because tobacco is poisonous to everyone. But, even though it is particularly poisonous to me, I can't fully agree. 

I like to hang out after work with my co-workers, but someone invariably starts smoking. Breathing the smoke for a long time makes it  difficult for me to work the next day, and sometimes much longer. 

Speaking of work, I have had to give up a few jobs because of  smoking in the workplace. It was hard for me to ask my employers to ban smoking because I knew that some of my co-workers were addicted. I knew that, until they could learn to adjust, it was going to be difficult for them to work effectively without the regular hit. For this reason, even now, I try to put up with the occasional whiff of smoke from the smoking area at work.

I don't think people should be forced to do what is good for them. Fighting an addiction under the threat of force makes it very difficult for the addicted person to fully overcome the addiction. People who are forced to quit often resort to compensating behaviors that turn into even worse addictions.

I do appreciate completely smoke-free trains, stores, and restaurants. But some eating establishments should be allowed to cater to those people who still think they need a place to relax with a cigarette. 

I also think it would ultimately be more effective to instead raise the tax on tobacco enough to encourage smokers to cut back or quit without making them feel forced to do so.
