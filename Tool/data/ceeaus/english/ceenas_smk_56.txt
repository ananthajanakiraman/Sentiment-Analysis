Recently more evidence has proven that second hand smoke can cause cancer. It is a very unhealthy feeling to enter a restaurant ready to eat a delicious healthy meal only to be disappointed by the smell of unhealthy cigarette smoke, just the smell of cigarette smoke in a restaurant makes me feel nauseas. Smoking in a closed area even if the restaurant has a no smoking area is still a problem. The smoke still lingers to the no smoking area. Some restaurants don`t have non smoking areas and after leaving the restaurant my clothes smell like cigarettes. This is not a good feeling for me. Making a law which bans smoking in restaurants is a very good idea because this would allow everybody to enjoy various foods offered in the community and also allows teenagers and children to go to the restaurants without having to breathe second hand smoke. Starbucks is a good example of a smoke free coffee shop and this image has made them very popular. Their policy is to smoke outside which I feel other restaurant should follow. Smoking these days is a very unhealthy habit and more people are against the fact of smoking than for smoking. Restaurants could have more business if they offered a smoke free environment. Most smokers crave a cigarette after a meal but which is important, a nice cooked meal in a beautiful restaurant or smoking a cigarette. I think the meal. These bans put on smoking will eventually lead people to quit because they don`t want to bother with all the hassles. As they realize that many areas now don`t allow smoking many people are inclined to cut back on the number of cigarettes they smoke, thus leading to a healthier lifestyle for smokers and non smokers alike.
