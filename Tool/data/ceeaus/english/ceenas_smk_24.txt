Should we endanger the life of others just to attain our personal satisfaction and happiness? Should we endanger the lives of the elderly who built the social institutions of the present and the young who are the future of Japan?  
Let us completely ban smoking in restaurants so everyone can enjoy the food that we eat, the beverages that we drink, and the air that we breathe. Restaurants are public places where individuals, friends, couples, and families ? smokers and non-smokers, young and elderly, healthy and sickly ? go to take pleasure in their favourite food and drinks. 
Medical science tells us that cigarette smoking is a source of health hazards not only to the smoker, but more gravely to the non-smoker inhaling second hand smokes. And smoking in restaurants exposes non-smokers to an unhealthy environment and to serious health risks ? particularly the young children, the elderly, and those with respiratory ailment whose health systems are weak. 
We recognize that everyone has a right to smoke cigarettes as it is a source of oneÅfs personal satisfaction and happiness. However, this right should not infringe on the more basic human rights of others ? the right to life and a healthy environment. Non-smokers have more basic human rights to a clean air, smoke-free restaurants and public places. 
Right to life is the most basic human right of humanity.  Perhaps the second basic human right is the right to a healthy environment where one can develop his/her potentials to the fullest ? intellectual, physical and spiritual.
