Smoking must be allowed in restaurants. Smokers have the same basic rights as non-smokers; to deny smokers the right to smoke is to deny their basic human right. In addition, by denying smokers their right to smoke, we are denying them their basic needs; nicotine is addictive, and smokers need to smoke to satisfy a physical craving. So far, I donÅft think there has been any effort denying fat people entry to McDonaldÅfs restaurants, why treat the smokers this way? Society cannot dictate what is good or bad, and it cannot enforce those standards and rules on individuals. Rather, society must facilitate and accommodate the needs of all groups; smokers and non-smokers. Restaurants already provide two completely separated and insulated areas, one for smokers and one for non-smokers. Failing to recognize the needs and the rights of the two camps can be very costly for restaurants, in particular; they lose clientele from both groups. If anything, it is those who are supporting such drastic restrictions on personal freedoms who need help: societies thrive when variety and tolerance are present, they wither and fall apart without these. Clearly, restaurants are places where customers want to enjoy their time; let us make them available to both smokers and non-smokers alike. Let both smokers and non-smokers enjoy their meals.
