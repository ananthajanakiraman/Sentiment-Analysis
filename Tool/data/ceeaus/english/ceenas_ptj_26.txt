I strongly agree that it is important for college students to have a part time job. 

Firstly, part time work related to their field of study can be extremely useful to the student in gaining work experience that will be very useful to the student after they finish college. Potential employers will be impressed at interviews and the students will have more knowledge of their work before they start post college full time jobs.

Secondly, students who come to cities from country areas to study at college, and those from lower socio-economic backgrounds often need to partly or fully support their living expenses and tuition while at college. It is far better that they work part time, complete their college education, than if they do not, as they will be able to contribute more to their society professionally and financially as an educated professional. They will also be contributing further to the society through their productive employment and the money they will be able to spend as necessary in the local economy.

Thirdly, part time jobs will give young people useful experience of the responsibilities, work ethic and people skills necessary to build successful workplace relationships once they enter full time employment. People who have experience in the workplace while at college will be much better prepared for the challenges of full time work after college ends. 

For these reasons, I believe having a part time job while at college very important for college students.
