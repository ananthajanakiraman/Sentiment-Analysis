Of course smoking tobacco should be banned in all restaurants in Japan. Tobacco smoke is a poison and has no reason being anywhere close to food, and no reason being anywhere close to where people eat or work.

Tobacco smoke permeates foods and makes it taste bad. Also, when people breathe smoke, it alters the taste of food, making it taste bad. Tobacco smoke is a habit-forming poison, and a stimulant. Many people react violently to it and become quite ill when exposed to even small amounts of smoke. 

Customers can't always choose where they will eat. Maybe they have heard that a restaurant is good and decide to try it at lunch. But if the restaurant is too smoky for them to eat at, they may not have time to find another place to eat lunch that day. That's not fair.

Restaurant workers have the right to work in a healthy environment, too. If customers are allowed to smoke, someone has to go serve them. Regular exposure to second-hand smoke is as bad for the health as regular smoking. Often, a person who has to work in a smoky environment goes through withdrawal pains when his or her work environment changes. They become addicted, even if they are not themselves smoking. And working in a smoky environment makes it that much harder to quit when they decide to quit.

Exposing restaurant customers to tobacco smoke is an insult to the customer. It's also also a safety issue for the employees. If it's against the law, selfish customers won't be able to demand a place to smoke. So it should be against the law everywhere.
