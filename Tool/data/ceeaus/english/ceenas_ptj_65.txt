I do not think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are three reasons for this. Firstly, the years spent at university are of utmost importance. In these four years students should focus on studying. At university, students learn skills that will essentially shape their future, and assist them for the rest of their working lives. For busy students, it is important to focus all their energy and concentration on studying for and passing examinations, Many students these days work, for example at convenience stores or restaurants until late into the night, and are then often late for classes the following day, or find it difficult to stay awake in lectures. This may cause them to fall behind in their studies, or may ultimately lead to them failing courses or even being asked to quit by their professor. As Japanese society is heavily focused on academic success, anything that obstructs such should be discouraged. Secondly, not only is tertiary education a tool for success in life, it is very expensive. All parents want the best for their children, and most families save money for years to be able to put their sons or daughters through college. In some cases, only to have their dreams dashed by the lack of effort on behalf of their children. By not concentrating on their studies, students are not only hurting themselves, but also destroying what their parents have worked very hard for. Thirdly, a large percentage of Japanese college students these days work part-time in low-skilled jobs in restaurants. Being able to flip a burger is of no importance whatsoever when it comes to getting a full-time job in, for example an office.  For these reasons I do not think having a part-time job while studying is important.
