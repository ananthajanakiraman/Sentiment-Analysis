I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
When I think back on my days as a college student in New Zealand, it would have been difficult to 
do several things without money.  I had several part-time jobs that enabled me to have continued with my tertiary studies, to pay my monthly rent for housing and to enjoy various social activities.

In New Zealand, it is common for teenagers after graduating from high school and then going onto university to move out of the family home and to spread their wings and become independent. Ultimately, the main reasons are, freedom to do whatever you wanted, hang out with friends and to prove to your parents that you were able to take care of yourself. Naturally, we need money to cover university fees, rent and daily living expenses including entertainment. 

 I was fortunate to receive a government sponsored student loan for the next 3 years, which covered all my tertiary fees and educational materials.  However, there wasnÅft enough money left to pay for rent or living expenses.  During my time at university, I worked part-time as a gas station attendant, kitchen hand, video rental clerk, parking attendant, several times as a waiter and finally as a hotel porter.

Working through a variety of jobs provided me with skills that are important for life.  I developed better communicative social skills working with different people, how to organize my finances more efficiently with living expenses and a sense of responsibility related to either work or my private life.
