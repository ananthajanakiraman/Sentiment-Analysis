College is a time for most students when their mind is at its most curious stage. They are entering a new phase of life and going to a place where they will be encountering new things. At college people make life long friends and to do this they share many of the same activities, such as swimming class or chemistry experiments or even creating a new light bulb. To work a part time job would take the student away from these activities which they have already paid for. The students should spend most of their time on campus; college is not just getting a degree and moving on. It is a period in a personÅfs life that should be cherished. If a student is always going to their part time job they will miss the social ideas of college will only be able to attend classes. Being able to communicate socially as well as understanding the academics is an important stage when attending college. I feel students should live in the dormitory and take part in activities offered by the school. This is a time when the students will learn most by being exposed to group activities with their peers. Living together and sharing ideas by being part of the same dorm gives you a permanent bond for life. The student who goes to the part time job will be left behind because they won`t be able to participate in many of the college activities offered by the dorm and social groups on campus. This is a time for awareness and creating new ideas. If a student is worried about getting to the part time job and doing work there it will take away from the main ideas of college life.
