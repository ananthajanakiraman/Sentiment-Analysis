Yes, I agree that college students should have part-time jobs. Time is money as they say. And if you have a little extra time, then making some extra money is not so bad for the following reasons:-

To begin with, today's job market has become highly competitive and in most of the cases a college degree does not guarantee a job or a job that pays well. Most of the advertisements that appear in the newspapers or on on-line portals, the preferred candidates even for entry level positions are with some experience. As a college student, there are several ways to acquire experience that are career oriented such as internships, practical experiences. Another option is a part-time job.

Part-time jobs offer several benefits to the college students. Primarily, the financial benefit. Apart from this, part time employment lays the foundation of the work history for the future. For this reason, students should carefully consider and select their part-time positions in order to acquire valuable work skill. By carefully selecting job, the gaps in the academic qualification can be minimized; also experience makes the candidate more attractive to the potential employers. Part-time employment helps to gain a better understanding of the chosen career field.

Part-time employment, whether in a corporate organization or hotel industry helps to evolve skills important to a potential employer. These skills may include leadership skills, commitment, team spirit and interpersonal skills, time management and taking criticism positively. Besides the knowledge gained through the educational experiences, employers today are pursuing candidates who are productive with well developed overall personality and are able to assimilate themselves into the environment of the organization. The skills that are learnt through part-time position will expand and increase skills and abilities at the same time benefiting financially.
