I agree with this statement for various reasons. The first reason is because studying costs a lot of money and it should not just be the job of the parents to pay for all of our education. Parents work very hard and pay for education right through until we leave university. Doing a part-time job also shows our parents that we are mature and responsible. Also, when we enter college, we are no longer children and so we should take it upon ourselves to find part-time work in order to help with the costs. I also believe that when we reach college age we should be taught the value of money and doing a part time job helps us realize this. College should be a special time in our lives when we learn not only from books but from the people around us. Learning from people and colleagues where we work enables college students to grow up quicker and learn about Åglife.Åh Finally, doing a part-time job helps us realize what job we might want to do when we graduate. Those experiences could also show us what jobs we donÅft want to do when we leave college. I think it is important to have a part time job that you can learn many things while doing it. Parents should encourage their kids to get jobs as soon as they reach the correct age.
