Yes, I emphatically support this life style and for several reasons.
Firstly, these are individuals who are entering into adulthood and if they do not understand that giving back to society, in some form of work, is an indispensable part of what it means to be a (valuable) member of this society, then I would highly recommend that they start to learn.  The college years provide an opportune time for the young men or women to learn to balance their social, work and school worlds in to what will make up THEIR interpretation of life. In summary, school is a wonderful opportunity for one to build their academic skills and yet what meaning have these if they are not applied to the real world? Some would say that a part-time job is not a place where too many skills are learned or applied (what skills exactly does one get for working at Dairy Queens on the weekends?). Well, skills such as money handling, balancing their own accounts, the management of time, dealing with people all add up to becoming a responsible individual. 
With freedom comes responsibility and this is something which cannot be taught in school. And so, this is why I firmly support college students working.
