I think smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in Japan. The reasons are quite simple.  First and most important smoking is dangerous to health, secondly, second-had smoke is unfair to non-smokers and finally, smoking, particularly in restaurants is bad for the taste of food.  To talk about the biggest reason, is almost obvious, smoking is well known to cause a variety of dangerous ailments. Smoking is a habit that has caused millions of deaths over the years, and unlike other vices; even in moderation had no health benefits.  Smoking is of course a choice which leads me to my second argument.  Yes, smoking is legal and people do want to smoke but it shouldnÅft be forced on non-smokers.  Heavy smoking populated countries like Ireland, Spain and many states in the US have banned smoking in not only restaurants but all buildings. This means non-smokers, get a relief. Second-hand smoke is unhealthy and non-smokers shouldnÅft be subjected to the ill effects of smokerÅfs bad habits.  Also children entering a family friendly restaurant have no choice where their parents take them. Inhaling smoke in young lungs should never be an option. 
Finally smoking is bad for food.  The taste of food is directly linked to taste and smell. If the environment is filled with smoke, food doesnÅft taste good. This is not the strongest of arguments for banning smoking in restaurants but ultimately why do people go out to eat?  To sample foods to eat in a environment that is safe, and enjoyable. Japan should ban smoking in all restaurants and soon!
