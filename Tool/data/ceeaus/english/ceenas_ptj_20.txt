I agree that itÅfs important for college students to have a part-time job. First, it instils a better sense of discipline and responsibility because it requires students to fulfill the expectations of their job and abide by the rules of the workplace. For example, the simple job of filing correspondence will teach the student the importance of being organized and attentive to details. It will help them realize that co-workers rely on the efficient performance of even small tasks, and this will motivate the student to be diligent and to take responsibility for the quality of their work. Part-time working students will also learn the value of financial discipline at an earlier age. Second, a part-time job broadens interest and opens a wider array of career possibilities for students who have yet a clear idea of what they want to do after college. Actual work experience will help the student determine what kind of job he likes or dislikes and which managerial skills he can build on (finance or human resources?). For example, a student who interns at an advertising agency may discover that he has an aptitude for graphic design or copywriting. Such hands-on experience provides a richer basis for planning a career than waiting around for any available job offer after graduation. Lastly, a part-time job during college is good preparation for the rigors and dynamics of the workplace. Usually, most of the new graduates enter their first jobs with little confidence and are too ÅggreenÅh to understand workplace relationships. Part-time work experience will familiarize the student of how office hierarchies work and where they can situate themselves as a newcomer. TheyÅfll have a better idea of where to put their skills to good use, and what kind of people they can go to for guidance and mentoring.
