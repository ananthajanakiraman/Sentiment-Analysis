Smoking in restaurants should be allowed for the following reasons: First, smoking is legal in Japan, second smoking and food and drinks go hand-in-hand, and third, smoking should be left to the businesses. This is a free country and the choice of smoking should be left to the employer or establishment.
First and quite elementary, until smoking is illegal, we should continue to allow smoking in all restaurants.  Smokers pay high taxes on cigarettes and Japan reaps the benefits. Why take away that right. Smoking is not dangerous like drinking a driving. Smoking is a way to relax which leads into my next point. Smoking is a part of the food culture. We eat, drink and smoke. ItÅfs a package that smokers find enjoyable. Its social, it part of eating to many people.  If a non-smoker doesnÅft like it, he/she can find a non-smoking restaurant.  Let the market decide.  
There are many vices in the world, but if its legal, it should be allowed. ItÅfs hypocritical for a country to allow one to buy a product but not allow one to use it?  The free market should in the end dictate how many restaurants allow smoking.  The establishment is trying to make a fair living. If smoking is banned, many smokers will choose their home or a bar to eat in and then we will be taking money away from hard working restaurant owner and the workers. In the end, if smoking is legal it should be allowed.
