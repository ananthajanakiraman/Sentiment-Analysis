It is not important for college students to have a part-time job.  The primary goal of any student should be to study.  Anything beyond study, whether club membership, community service, or a part-time job, is supplementary to a student's education.

There can be several benefits to having a part-time job.  The principle benefits being that the student is able to earn some extra money and gain work experience.  Extra money is always welcome and work experience may be helpful in finding a full-time job upon graduation.  Although, if one works part-time at the local fast-food restaurant and hopes to secure a position as a computer programmer upon graduation, then burger flipping experience might not be very helpful.

On the other hand, a part-time job can also have a decidedly negative impact on studies.  For example, if a student, particularly a first-year student, is already stretched thin by the requirements of college-level courses, then in no way is a part-time job beneficial.  Students must be able to focus on their studies and they should weigh carefully the impact of extra-curricular activities on their academic performance.  If there is negligible negative impact, then a part-time job or any other extra-curricular activity should be fine.

In the end, working a part-time job while studying full-time can be a positive or negative factor and the decision to take-up part-time work should be left solely at students' discretion.
