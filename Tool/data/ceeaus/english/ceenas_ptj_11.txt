To a certain extent I agree with the idea of college students having part-time jobs. I understand that for some of them it is a matter of necessity. Not every family can afford maintaining their son or daughter to entirely dedicate him or herself to the studies; moreover, the costs of studying in a college are getting higher and higher by the year. Nevertheless, this period is extreme important for maturing the future professional and a part-time job not directly related to the course could consume part of the momentum and energy that could preciously be used for their graduation.
	There are innumerous cases of students working so hard during their so-called part-time jobs that once they are back to their classrooms they lack the necessary power to concentrate and take an active role on the learning process. The extra time (when thereÅfs some!) is used only for resting, and the students see themselves acquiring knowledge exclusively from their poor participation on their colleges, with no time dedicated to their books.
	A solution could be more scholarships from the government or at least a system that would allow students get only part-time jobs that could help them put the theories they are learning from their books and classrooms into practice.
