I think I agree that it is important for college students to have part time jobs. College students often find it all too easy to hide from the real world, and part time work should help them stay attached. Moreover, part time jobs can provide a backdrop of experience against which the knowledge of lots of bare facts which they obtain at school can be converted into a level of wisdom, preparing them to function in the broader society.

There are some classes in some departments where students need to focus strictly on their subjects, but such classes are not very common. More often, part time jobs give students a break from their studies -- a chance to let their subconscious processes work on the information they get in class. Part time jobs will usually help concentration more than hinder it.

Part time jobs can provide students with social connections they can't get from pure class work and association with fellow students and faculty. Such connections can enrich the lives of those whose career will ultimately remain with one company, and can provide a network to help those who end up needing to change companies. Student jobs can also provide a work record and references to help them get their first job after school.

A part time job related to the individual student's coursework can help the student see practical applications of the course material. Practical background helps the student obtain a real foundation for understanding the principles he or she is studying.

But even when a particular part time job is not related to the specific subject being studied, or the field the student eventually wants to enter, it still provides more background of actual experience. Real-world jobs help students mature into functioning adult members of society.
