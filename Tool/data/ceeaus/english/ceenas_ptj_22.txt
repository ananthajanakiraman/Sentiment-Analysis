I agree with the fact that young students should get a part time job so they can learn the value of money at an early age, on the other hand working from a young age can lead to loss of interest in other genuine activities that young people should be engaging in . Such as learning to play an instrument, sports or simply hang out with a good friend and developing crucial relationships.
There is also the danger of ending up with a materialistic inclined personality and with diminished possibilities of understating our true nature as human beings. Having a part time job "which means " to start working " for the first time...it is something that we all eventually will have to  do sooner or later so in my personal opinion it is best not to rush it . 
All our lives are concentrated and focused around our work since its our source of income which allow us be a part of the system.  
and it is also one of the main causes of human unhappiness working for earning instead of working for the love of doing something . Working for the sole purpose of making a few bucks can be a distraction and further cloud one's understanding of the tricky monetary enslavement system we live under.
That is why that short span between childhood and working life should be increased in order to assure more mental stability to the individual
