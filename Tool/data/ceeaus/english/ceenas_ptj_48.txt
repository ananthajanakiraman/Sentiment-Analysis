I agree with this opinion. College students are generally fresh out of high school and in most cases have had no direct experience in the work force. Taking a part-time job will give them the opportunity to learn important responsibilities for life, things that they would not be able to learn in their schools or at home from their family. Such skills as keeping to a firm work schedule, managing their finances as well as working for superiors are all good life-skill enhancements. Searching for a job is also a valuable skill that will benefit them for life. Such things as filling out a resume, going to a job interview, experiencing the joys of finding a job as well as the pain of being rejected are all useful and beneficial lessons. Another important factor to consider is learning to work in cooperation with others. Having to take a low and humble position until youÅfve put in your time is an experience all workers must go through and getting it early in life will only serve to make one stronger. In addition, the added income will perhaps help relieve their parents of the very high expense of funding their college education. ItÅfs good for everyone involved.
