There are a number of reasons why I believe college students should have a part-time job. Firstly, students need to learn the value of money. Throughout their time at school they are fully dependent on their parents and grandparents for all their financial needs.  Many youngsters growing up in todayÅfs consumerist society may have little concept of the real value of money. They are given their own cell phones funded by their parents and are always in possession of the latest games and clothes. When they want something new, in most cases they only have to ask. Having a part-time job, and earning a wage allows students a degree of financial independence and the chance to learn to both save money, and spend wisely. Secondly, having a part-time job allows students to develop practical skills, for example communicating with a variety of age groups, teamwork, dealing with problems, business etiquette, and using formal spoken language. These are skills which students may have studied about, but not had a chance to put into practice. Thirdly, students in a part-time job can gain valuable experience in their chosen (future) field of employment. For example, if they wish to become a teacher, they can work part-time in a nursery school, or cram school. If they wish to work in tourism, they can work at hotels or as local tour guides at weekends. The current employment market for graduates is very challenging, with many companies receiving thousands of applications for each position. Having prior work experience may be the key to securing a good job. In addition, students can develop professional contacts, leading to opportunities of full-time employment in the same organization upon graduation. For these reasons, I believe that having a part-time job is very important for students.
