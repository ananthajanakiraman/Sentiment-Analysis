I disagree with this statement. As a non-smoker who dislikes inhaling smoke, especially when I am eating, it is very tempting to support the statement. However, I recognize that by supporting the statement I would be putting my personal preferences ahead of the rights of others. 

There are two groups of people who's rights would be violated by such a rule, smokers and restaurant proprietors.

Smokers have rights. I don't believe that they have the right to poison the air of non-smokers, but they do have the right to enjoy a cigarette in a restaurant If the proprietor decides to allow smoking in that restaurant. Non-smokers have the right to not enter such restaurants, therefore there should be no need for such a ban on smoking in all restaurants.

The proprietors of restaurants have the right to set the rules for their own business. This right should not violated by such an overall ban on smoking. 

In the past, smoking was so popular in Japan that it was very difficult to eat a meal in a restaurant without inhaling other peoples' smoke. Now, however, smoking is becoming less popular and it is easier to find restaurants that ban smoking, or where the smoking area is well removed from the non-smoking area. This is the market at work, and it should be allowed to work without introducing such overreaching laws as the one being proposed here.
