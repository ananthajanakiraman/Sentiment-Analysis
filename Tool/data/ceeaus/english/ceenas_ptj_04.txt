Japanese college students should not have part-time jobs. They have enough distractions as it is. Moreover, part-time jobs are not real jobs, and therefore will not provide useful experience. 

Japanese society is highly specialized. Workers are not expected to function well in a broad range of contexts. They are expected to do one job and do it well. Evaluations are all important. Workers must be familiar with what others have done in their area of specialty. If they don't know what others have done, whatever they might produce will not fit in. Neither they, nor what they produce, will be valuable to society. Learning what others have done is a full-time job by itself. 

Because it's external to their subject, part-time work will interfere with their grades, and with specialization. It's usually menial work, not fit for a specialist, not real work at all. Such experience is useless when they get their jobs in their chosen fields.

Internships are not part-time jobs. They are obtained in the field of specialty, and thus provide relevant experience. And the money they provide is not enough to be another source of temptation. Internships are all they need.

Japanese colleges provide club activities to help students socialize. These activities are sufficient to teach them how to behave in society. Part-time jobs will only take them away from club activities and give them unstructured social experiences with unpredictable results. They become unwilling and unable to fit in with their fellow students and teachers.

Part-time work that is available to college students is unworthy of the finely honed workers Japanese society demands.
