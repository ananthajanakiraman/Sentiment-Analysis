I disagree with this statement. One of the main reasons is because it creates billions of revenue for the government that can be then recycled and used to restore old buildings or some other areas of need in our cities. If smokers are not allowed to smoke in restaurants then it will stop a lot of the single people and groups of people without children from going there. They will find other places to go to and so the restaurant business and culture will be affected. Smoking brings people together and is a very sociable habit. It creates friendships and brings people together. People should be allowed to do what they like when they like as long as it doesnÅft harm others. There is no hard evidence that smoking causes lung cancer or any other diseases. It is just non-smokers who have made up this phenomenon to create controversy. I am yet to see any ÅgrealÅh evidence linking the two together. Cigarettes now have filters and are not so strong compared to before when no filters were used. People should stop complaining so much and get on with their own lives. Also, most restaurants have adequate air conditioners and so the smoke is quickly taken out of the room and therefore doesnÅft annoy any other visitors there. When you enter a restaurant it doesnÅft smell of cigarettes so that is the proof that it is not affecting the air or making the furniture smell of smoke. Smokers should be allowed their freedom to smoke where they want.
