I strongly agree with this statement, I will explain in these following three reasons. 
Reason one, 
I believe a part time job is necessary to be able to survive in this day and age. With the cost of living as expensive as it is. ItÅfs often a struggle for many students with the continual increase of being a student.
Reason two,
As a college student it is an excellent time to enjoy the college life with the long length of vacation. This time can be well used to work to save money to enjoy daily life. Which could be greatly wasted and I think some students perhaps become very lazy and unproductive during the long vacation times. Or on the other hand work a few nights a week to help pay for travel which I think is an important part of a young persons growth and becoming a well rounded person in todayÅfs society and often multicultural cities.
Reason three,
In some cases well off students may not have the need to work a part time job to survive. But, I strongly believe that working a part time job while studying is necessary for development of time management skills. Balancing going to classes, study, social life and work will benefit students in the future.
In conclusion the benefits and life skills that students get from working far out ways that of not working.
