I entirely agree with this point of view; furthermore, I support the idea of a complete ban of smoking at any public space.
	It is scientifically proved the harm smoking can cause not only to smokers but also to second-hand smokers. For a long period, it was thought that the governments would benefit from all the taxes collected from its sales. On the contrary, after all the cancer and stroke cases revealed through innumerous researches, itÅfs proved that, in the long term, such benefits are eclipsed by the cost over the public health system.
	The ban should be enforced specially on the restaurants for one simple reason: it also disturbs one of the most important senses used while eating ? the smell. ItÅfs easy to see how much more pleasure one can enjoy from a more colorful and tasty meal without the horrible interference of the tobacco.
	It is notorious how the exposure to the chemicals contained in the smoke can risk our health. Therefore, a total ban of smoking in public spaces should not only be limited to the restaurants. Why restrict the benefits to one place? LetÅfs not forget all the parks, town squares, streets, stations and so on. In addition, this measure would help smokers to quit and discourage others from starting this deadly habit.
