I totally agree with this statement for the following two reasons: First, getting a part-time job is part of learning how to become independent and second, working part-time gives young students their first taste of freedom. My first reason is pretty straightforward, itÅfs when you have your first job that you first experience dealing with a boss (even though dealing with a teacher has similarities to this), dealing with co-workers (though there again classmates are kind of the same thing) but also, dealing with money and handling customers. To do well in school we essentially need to show up, sit quietly and study. In most jobs we have to think on our feet and get immediate and spontaneous feedback form the customers if we are not doing well or arenÅft moving fast enough. This dimension, having to perform tasks well in a limited time, is somewhat lacking from our schooling, so is the training in interpersonal relationships that is so important in the workplace. My second reason has to do with the fact that students will for probably the first time be earning their own money, that they can spend anyway they want. I still remember my first paycheck and the impression of power that it gave me: I could spend, and spend it on whatever I whatever I wanted! It also seemed that choosing what I what I spent my money on, that peculiar sort of freedom, also made me a lot more cautious and less apt to waste moneyÅc Yet another good reason for getting a part-time job I guess!
