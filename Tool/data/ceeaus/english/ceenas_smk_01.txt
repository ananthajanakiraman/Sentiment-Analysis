I partially disagree with this statement. To be sure, anti-smoking efforts in Japan currently lag significantly behind those of many other developed nations, and further progress in this area is to be desired. Yet a total ban on smoking in restaurants is a rather extreme solution, and would undoubtedly meet considerable resistance among the population.
Currently, there are virtually no restrictions on restaurant smoking policy in Japan. Implementing a total ban on smoking at restaurants would represent the complete opposite approach to the issue. Between these polar extremes, it is, however, possible to find a middle route.
	Although it is certainly advisable to urge people not to smoke, it is nonetheless their right to do so, regardless of concern for their personal health and well-being. Therefore, in considering the appropriate policy, one must balance the right of those who wish to smoke against the rights and health concerns of those who donÅft. 
	In many places around the world, partial restrictions on smoking (without completely banning it) have been implemented with considerable success. Restaurants and bars can be legally compelled to provide a separate, ventilated room for their smoking patrons, or alternatively (if they cannot afford such renovations), become a fully non-smoking establishment. Indeed, many establishments in Japan have already built such facilities purely on their own initiative.
	Therefore, it is quite possible to find a middle ground between the current lax standards, and an outright ban on smoking in restaurants.
