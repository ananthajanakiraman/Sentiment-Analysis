I agree that it is important for college students to have a part time job. There are many reasons why. IÅfll give three. 
Firstly, the experience gained from working to earn money and learning to manage the money one has made is a lesson that will last a lifetime.  Even if their parents are helping with the tuition and they are only working to make their own spending money, they will learn to use their money more wisely since they had to spend time and effort to receive the money they are using. Students that are taken care of by their parents too much may lead to unmotivated workers that quit easily. There is no sadder story than that of a student that has finished 16 years of education without ever working a day in their life, only to run back home to their parents and live at home after college because of difficulties on their first job.
Secondly, working part time may lead a student to finding skills they are good at but had never used before. A part time job may lead to a change in their major or it may change the studentÅfs idea of what they want to do for the rest of their life. A part time job can challenge a student to do something that they would not have tried just taking classes on campus.
	Finally, the people skills developed will help in any job, especially dealing with a boss and coworkers. Those people skills may also be good references or contacts for future work.
