I believe that a college student should not be burdened with the responsibility of fiscal independence, and that none should assume that he should hold a part-time job during the course of his studies. I have three reasons to support my claim. Firstly, college is an essential part of the academically minded individualÅfs growth and development. A high-school student generally focuses his academic attention of mastering basic skills, the foremost of which is learning how to think. In college, however, he begins to explore concepts in much greater detail and depth, engaging in activities of critical thought and analysis. Balancing the mundane realities of holding a part-time job will simply distract this level of focus, and hamstring the overall efficacy of his college experience. Secondly, College is an important time in the social and sexual growth an individual, and his time not spent studying is best taken up with developing himself in these ways in order to become a stable, confident and contributing member of society in later years. Finally, part-time work generally pays very little, so the actual financial gain from such work is almost negligible. His time is much better spent in academic and social activities in order to prepare him for his future social responsibilities. Besides, there will be plenty of time after college is finished to learn how to hold down a job and manage his finances.
