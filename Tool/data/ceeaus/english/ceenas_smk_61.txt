I disagree with this opinion. I have three opinions. First, if smoking is banned in all restaurants this may begin a trend in other establishments such as bars and nightclubs. Eventually retailers would follow the trend to ban smoking in shopping malls. Shoppers could also enjoy a smoke free shopping experience. Franchises and larger operations may be able to survive the decline in business. However, the small restaurateur would struggle with the lost sales from smokers. The restaurant industry would suffer not only from local business but could also lose business from tourists. Second, business tax revenue for the government would be reduced due to slow business. Small restaurateurs would be forced to close their businesses. Some would even go bankrupt by attempting to turn the business around. The government would need to offer incentives for restaurateurs to remain in business. Third, the casualty insurance industry would also profit less due to lower premiums. Many small insurance brokers serving the commercial business community would suffer from lower profits. A non smoking establishment would have zero probability of a fire due to smoking. Therefore, there would be less liability from customer negligence. Based on the above reasons, I am against the opinion. This is supporting the business community.
