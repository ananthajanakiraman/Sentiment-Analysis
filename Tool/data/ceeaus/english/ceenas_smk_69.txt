Freedom is a basic right of the individual in any civilized society. That is why I implore you to allow smoking in any and all restaurants. If they were to take away our first right after birth, to breath, then what next?  Already the society is too controlled. We cannot even talk on our cell phones on the train! I find this very strange as people are talking all around me. Why canÅft I speak with my friend miles away? We must wear seatbelts. I know this is for our own safety. And yet, how much control does the society need to place on its citizens before it stops making rules to protect us? Be in bed by 10 pm. Never walk around with chopsticks in your mouth. Cut your lawn back so that nobody strips over itÅc And on and on. there is no end and we are headed towards a communist system. As you can see if is a question of freedom. Just as patrons have the choice to eat out or not.
Also, the restaurant owner has the freedom to install fans with filters. If you cannot handle the noise and smoke then maybe you have the freedom to stay home.
