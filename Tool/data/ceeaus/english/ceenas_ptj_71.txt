I donÅft really see why so many people feel it is so important for students to actually get a job. When I was growing up my parents were good enough (and enlightened enough) to pay for my education and cover all my living expenses. Perhaps I did not have a car when I was 18, nor could I really afford to go out drinking with my friends as often as I would have liked, it is nonetheless the case that because I never worked while in college I was able to truly enjoy taking my classes and focus on my studies. This approach paid off as I graduated near the top of my class and was then able to get the job I wanted (as opposed to a job that would simply allow me to pay the bills) and make a smooth start to my career. Others were not so fortunate: one of my friends from college had to pay his way (his parents could not afford to support him) and he was only able to stay in school for a little over a year before he finally dropped, suffering from exhaustion. I feel there is a lesson to be learned here and I have already started putting some money aside to put my own kids through college one day.
