I believe it is important for college students to have part-time jobs.  The main reason I feel this way is that it allows students to start building a strong work ethic.  It is a difficult transition entering the work force as an adult after college.  And part-time jobs provide valuable experience to help ease this transition.  Young people must study not only academic subjects but also must learn social and financial lessons to be successful in life.
Having a part-time job also helps students to become financially independent of their parents.  They can use the extra money to start saving and also to enjoy their free time more.
Having a job also provides students with structure so they can learn how to divide their time to be successful in all areas of life.
While working, students can make valuable business contacts to help them get a full-time job after they graduate.  The best part-time job then would be one in a field in which the student intends to pursue a career.
However, the demands of a job, even a part-time one, can be exhausting.  So students must not let their jobs interfere with their academic studies.  If a part-time job becomes time-consuming or stressful they must keep their priorities straight.  If necessary they should quit their jobs rather than sacrifice their academic success.
Despite the risks though, I believe having a part-time job as a college student is beneficial and important.
