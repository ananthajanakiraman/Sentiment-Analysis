College students are usually at a stage in their lives where they have the ability to learn many things. It seems like these days work ethics is a big issue. If college students had part time jobs and could understand how to work with others and carry out various task to accomplish a goal at work, this could be rewarding for their character and personal growth not to mention learning or understanding something new. Basic work ethics are learned through part time jobs. Having a part time job in college will teach the student discipline and give them an understanding of money and how it is earned. Looking to the future and seeing more college students with credit cards gives more reasons to be concerned. If parents of the students pay for everything the students will not have a sense to payback what they have borrowed from the credit cards. This will carry over into everyday life and will show irresponsible students and eventually breakdown the economic system which is happing today. Students must learn the value of money and how it is earned, to do this they must spend time working and not spend more than they have earned. Using credit cards is a false sense of money and the credit card companies are constantly pushing students to use cards, therefore, students spend more than they earn without having to get a part time job and rely on their parents to take care of the bill. If credit cards were banned from campus more students would understand the value of money and have to get part time jobs.
