I totally disagree with this statement because I am a smoker.

I think there should be a balance. Smokers and non-smokers can live in harmony. There should be smoking and non-smoking restaurants. Why can't there be both? It makes perfect sense to me. Non smokers don't have to go to restaurants that allow smoking.

My second point is that most restaurants have separate sections for smokers and non smokers, often on different floors! For a long time smokers and non smokers have been living in harmony. So why change anything? If the current segregation of restaurants is working and people are happy then let's keep it that way.

Lastly, my question is what will all the smokers do if they can't smoke in restaurants? All that will happen is that the smokers will stand out the front of the restaurants and smoke. This will make the sidewalks dirtier and more crowded. Tokyo sidewalks are already too crowded. Imagine what they would be like if millions of smokers were standing outside all the restaurants. It would be terrible. So let the smokers stay inside.

So in conclusion I believe that smokers should be allowed to stay in restaurants. It makes perfect sense to me.
