I agree with the above statement for a number of reasons. The most important reason however, is that I believe that anyone who goes to work, even part time, will better learn the value and responsibility of money and how hard people have to work to get it. By working a part time job, students will better understand and appreciate what a good education costs these days. Many students I knew in University didnÅft pay a dime of their University tuitions and only worked during their summer vacations. I myself had to work full time in the summers and part time through the rest of the school year in order to save enough for my tuition and daily living expenses. Furthermore, that experience of having to balance my studies, work schedule, finances and social life all at the same time, has benefit me every day since. I strongly believe that it allowed to do better in the job I got after graduating as IÅfd already experienced a lot of the requirements of actually having a job while still a student. Some of my co-workers who had not did not do so wellÅc A part time job, a full time job or any job for that matter can only be seen as a positive life experience for any young college student.
