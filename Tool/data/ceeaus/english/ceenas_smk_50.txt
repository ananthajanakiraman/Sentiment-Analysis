I agree with the statement above for several reasons.  First, secondhand smoke harms non-smokers.  Too many Åenon-smokingÅf sections of restaurants are arbitrarily, haphazardly designed.  In effect, smoke drifts from smoking to non-smoking sections, harming all its way.

Secondly, while customers patronize restaurants or their choice, restaurant workers are stuck in their workplace. Would ToyotaÅfs union, for instance, expose its employees to hazardous chemicals involved in automobile manufacturing? No.  As unionization in the food/service industry is practically nonexistent, the responsibility rests with government to protect its citizens. 

Finally, society---both smokers and non-smokers--- pay a massive cost for second-hand smoke related illnesses.  While smokers may willingly pay such costs, non-smokers should not have to.  Second-hand smoke sickens people. The evidence is indisputable.  As people become sick, they need costly medical (hospitalization, medicine, etc..) treatments.  While all of us have an ethical duty to care for all our fellow citizens, it is unfair that non-smokers must pay for, in the form of higher insurance premiums and taxes, the care of those who make a poor lifestyle choice.

Seatbelt regulations, to the chagrin of Åefree lifestyle advocates), have long since been passed into law.  Simply, they save lives and reduce societal costs. In similar fashion, the government must take decisive action against smoking in restaurants, thereby protecting the health of those exposed and reducing the costs of healthcare.
