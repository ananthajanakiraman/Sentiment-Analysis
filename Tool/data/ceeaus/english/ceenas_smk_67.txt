I believe that smoking should not be banned in restaurants in Japan for the following three reasons. Firstly, smoking is not illegal in society, so what right does an individual establishment have to ÅgrewriteÅh the rules that we all live by and accept? Certainly smoking can be frowned upon, but an outright ban borderlines on illegal. Smoking may make some people uncomfortable, much in the way that loud earphones or voluble cel-phone use on trains is irritating. However, can we ban such behaviour? Smoking is a behaviour, and restaurants do not have the right to police behaviour. Secondly, restaurants are ultimately businesses, and must serve the needs of customers in order to remain solvent. Currently, many people wish to smoke while they eat and drink, and for as long as that is the case, restaurants should provide spaces where this is possible. Certainly smoking sections are necessary in order to provide non-smokers with comfortable environments also; however, an outright ban merely seems draconian and unfair, and unworthy of a civilized democracy. Finally, there is the ÅgsnowballÅh issue: if we ban smoking due to health concerns, what will be next? Banning meat-eating if vegetarian lobbies gain the upper hand in the burgeoning health-craze? Or banning furniture made of wood if anti-forestry groups gain the upper hand? Banning smoking in restaurants is the beginning of a slippery slope, as self-interested lobbies begin to successfully steer public opinion to serve ultimately selfish, nonsensical and short-sighted goals.
