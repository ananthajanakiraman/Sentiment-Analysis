In comparison to those who do not go to college, young adults tend to, but not always of course, work in jobs that do not require as much education or specialisation than those of their college counterparts. Generally, non college students have to adapt from school life to work in a relatively short time but this is less of a problem, since this change is more manageable as the work concerned is usually less sophisticated.

This is not the case with college or university students. By working part time whilst furthering their studies, they are able to gain a valuable insight about assimilation into the workforce. This bridging effect better enables them to adapt quickly in their leap from education to the workforce. 

Working part time teaches them valuable practical lessons about life and employment that theory based universities and colleges cannot be expected to. College and university graduatesÅf jobs are likely to be more sophisticated and as such, I believe working part time is a valuable experience for such students. It teaches them about budgeting, work ethics, workplace relationships, time management, productivity and so on in a practical manner and can help universities and colleges focus less on these issues and instead concentrate on the core course material for their respective field.
