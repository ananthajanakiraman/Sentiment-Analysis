I agree that smoking should be banned from all the restaurants in the country. 
The largest and most undisputable reason is that smoking shortens peopleÅfs lives. It is definitely the largest cause of lung cancer in the world and is a plague on mankind. A substitute habit should be invented for people wanting to relax that will not kill them slowly while polluting the air around them. 
Sanitary issues are also important to think about since smoke not only stains the smokers teeth, clothes and hair, it stains the walls and must therefore get on the plates, in the food and drinks as well. Air walls, air conditioners and curtains do not completely block out the smoke or smell from the non-smoking side of a restaurant. For some extra sensitive people it could make eating at that restaurant impossible.
Safety is another reason why smoking should be banned.  Lighting fires indoor is one of the most obvious reasons for buildings to burn down, and with the potential for a cigarette butt that has not been full extinguished to find itÅfs way into the trash, onto the floor or perhaps even be doused with a flammable liquid such as Bacardi 151.
