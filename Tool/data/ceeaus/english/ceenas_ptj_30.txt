I agree it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  

In Australia, most students have their first part-time job when they are high school students.  This is mainly for two reasons.  Firstly, a part time job allows them to save money, and gain a small amount of independence from their parents.  Secondly, it allows them to interact with their local community and teaches them various Åepeople-skillsÅf that will useful in later life, both personally and in their careers.

I had my first part-time job when I was 14 years old, working for a few hours a week at a local pharmacy.  I think college students are more than capable of managing a part-time job.  It teaches them many valuable things from an early age such as: an appreciation of the effort required to earn a living; building social skills outside the home and school by interacting with the public on an individual basis; building their individual personality, confidence and independence; and learning how to juggle both working and doing study at the same time.   

I was very surprised to discover when I first came to Japan how few students had part-time jobs while they were studying.  Many people also believe that a student can bring more maturity and experience to their studies if they are currently working part-time while at college.  Otherwise, their study is just purely academic.  Hence, it is my opinion that it is not only important for college students to have a part-time job, but beneficial as well.
