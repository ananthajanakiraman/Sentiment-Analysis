I do support the idea of college students working part-time, or even full-time for that matter for the following reasons. To begin, I believe by working it teaches students many valuable lessons about life that will also be a part of his/her educational process. One of those lessons to learn is about the value of money. Most kids of college age do not fully understand the value of money, as they have been given almost everything they have, without any REAL knowledge of the costs. Nor do they understand all the efforts someone had to make to pay for those things. 

Another good life-lesson that working provides is having a better understanding of responsibility. Being responsible for some, or all of the costs of oneÅfs education will hopefully tie-in with understanding the value of money; in addition, for having responsibility for oneÅfs own success, as well as failure. Depending on our own disciplines to achieve success is one of the greatest assets a person can have to obtain control of oneÅfs desires. Too often young people depend on others to see to it that their lives are on the right track. 

This, in my opinion is unfortunate because if we are so spoiled and have things done for us, or have everything paid for us without any effort, I believe we do not acquire the much-needed respect for people, time, money, or responsibility, not to mention many other aspects of being responsible for oneÅfs self that were not mentioned in these opinions.
