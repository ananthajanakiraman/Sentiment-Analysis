College is a transitional time from dependence to independence for most people in modern society. I think it is important for college students to have a part time job, and I shall support my claim with three points. Firstly, on the domestic front, a young person generally leaves the security of the family unit at this time in his life and begins to strike out on his own. Part time work during a course-load at college will begin to encourage thoughts of pecuniary insight and financial responsibility. Secondly, a college student needs to be able to afford school supplies, and to be able to support his changing interests, be they hobbies, extra-curricular activities, or simply entertainment. Finally, as he begins to assert his independence, a college student will likely begin to explore thoughts of starting his own family. Whether or not he will actually go so far as to do so of course will vary from person to person. However, dating, courting and generally meeting viable people with whom to explore these possibilities will likely manifest themselves during this transitional time. Independent means of supporting these activities is essential in order to become a responsible, contributing member of society. For the reasons stated above, I believe that a college student needs the experience of part-time work.
