    I believe smoking should be banned from all restaurants. I have two reasons for this.
    The first and most obvious reason is the effect that second-hand smoke has on non-smokers. Family members of those who smoke are more prone to health problems than the smokers themselves are. Keeping this in mind, non-smokers who want to go the restaurant should be allowed to enjoy a smoke-free environment without having to worry about any health problems that will occur from it. Putting aside the problem of the customers, letÅfs also keep in my mind the workers who have to work at the restaurants and potentially work there everyday. That would come to five days or more a week of unwanted exposure to smoke. They should be allowed to have a smoke-free working environment as well.
    Another reason to ban smoking is that tobacco in the air has a definite effect on the food that is served there. One of the main reasons to go to a restaurant is to appreciate the food. It is hard to really enjoy the taste of food when you are inhaling smoke at the same time. The smell of the smoke becomes entangled with the food to the point where it becomes hard to tell what the food really tastes like. This canÅft be good for the customer nor can it be good for the restaurant.
    For these two reasons, I believe that smoking should be banned in all restaurants. This is not to say that smoking is banned altogether. Smokers can still smoke. ItÅfs just that we have to consider the welfare and health of non-smokers in public places and that includes restaurants.
