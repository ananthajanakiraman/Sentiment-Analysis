I disagree with this opinion. I have three opinions. First, most students often seek part-time jobs at entertainment establishments such as bars or nightclubs as an escape from school life. These part-time jobs could be an obvious distraction in their daily studies. Students would be more attracted to the lucrative tips instead of attending classes or study groups. Second, in extreme cases, when students are exposed to very lucrative part-time jobs such as dealing at a Las Vegas casino, they would most likely quit school. For example, students would be mesmerized at the cash potential of winning at the tables in Las Vegas. Currently, there is a nationwide boom with Texas Hold ÅeEm Poker in North America. Recently, students have been learning to become professional poker players rather than pursuing a diploma or degree. Third, Texas Hold ÅeEm Poker has become so popular that many young players have evolved from learning online. If you are skilled, with some luck, the prize money is quite rewarding. This new trend has swept North America and continues to grow larger. Playing online poker has become the new addictive drug. You have access to play 24 hours and a chance to win substantial cash prizes. This part-time job is fast becoming a full-time job for many young students. The goal is to enter a poker tournament and ultimately win the grand prize money. Based on the above reasons, I am against the opinion. This allows students an opportunity for an incomplete education.
