There is merit to the opinion that college students should have part-time jobs. However it is important not to overlook the main purpose of a college education. The main purpose is for them to sharpen their skills for the job market and put as much focus as possible on learning about their chosen field. In many cases of higher education; such as law, medicine and engineering the in-class time is supplemented by internships which are related to coursework. In this case, a large number of hours are required for lab experiments or casework. This makes it virtually impossible to consider any type of part-time job. Those who try to balance a job and a heavy course load, often do it to the detriment of their grades and their physical health. Everyone knows it is difficult to work and study at the same time. This applies to young people as well as adults. If young people must have extracurricular activities, it should be related to their studies or club or community activities. WhatÅfs more, picking up a few healthy habits, such as devoting enough time to exercising and recreational activities, is something that college life should be all about. This will improve their resumes and give them a well-rounded lifestyle before they are introduced to the tedious working world.
