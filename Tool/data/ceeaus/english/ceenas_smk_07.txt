Smoking should be banned in all public places because of the clearly harmful effects of secondhand smoke.

Smokers often like to claim that their right to smoke is an individual right as important as the right to vote or the right to free speech, as if the act of smoking were something to be championed, as if their ancestors had endured long, violent, and bloody rebellions against
oppressive rulers with the sole aim of gaining the right to light up a cigarette. No such battles took place, and anyone attempting to claim as an individual right the act of inhaling a drug with unquestionably harmful consequences to one's body has a strange conception of the rights of human beings.

Furthermore, due to its harmful effects on society as a whole, smoking doesnÅft qualify as an individual right. Friends talking and laughing over cigarettes in restaurants share smiles while they spread increased risk to cancer to all those in range of the smoke pouring from their mouths. Air filtering machines can do little to prevent the immediate risk of inhaling a nearby diner's second-hand smoke. Partitions serve as mere window dressing.

Even if all of the risks to those other than the smoker could be removed, society still carries financial responsibility for the smoker's health. If the smoker is enrolled in a national or group health plan, the smoker's increased rate of sickness and risk of acquiring serious diseases like cancer lead to an enormous financial consequence for society as a whole. Society also shares the responsibility for providing financial support for any dependents of a smoker, or for the disposal of the smoker's corpse once the smoker succumbs to disease. For this reason society has every right to limit the rights of individuals that adversely affect society as a whole.
