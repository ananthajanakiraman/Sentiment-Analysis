I realize that smoking is an unhealthy habit. I smoked for two years and quit smoking about six years ago. My body and mind became much healthier in all ways. Some of the best times to enjoy a cigarette were after a nice dinner at a restaurant and enjoying a cup of coffee. For many people smoking is a pleasure of life. I still go to my favorite restaurants but no longer crave cigarettes after a meal and I really don`t like the smell of them but to ban cigarettes in all restaurants would be extreme. Some city governments in the USA have banned smoking in their cities and I`m strongly against this. I believe it should be left up to the restaurant owner to make this decision if the owner wants to have a non smoking area or not. People should have the right to choose, no one is forcing them to go to a smoking restaurant. Banning smoking on airplanes was a good idea because the second hand smoke could linger and it is a necessity for people to travel. You donÅft have to go to a restaurant. Often, modern ventilation systems are very good. Recently I sat in the smoking area with a smoker and I didn`t notice the smoke because of the ventilation system. Giving governments more control and owners less control is the main concern I have. I believe the government should make sure restaurants serve clean food so we don`t get sick, yet this is something the consumer should be able to judge. If you see an unclean restaurant do you really want to eat there even though the government says it is alright? Some things are better left up to the consumers to decide on.
