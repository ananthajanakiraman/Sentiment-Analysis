I totally agree with this statement. Before the dangers of smoking were realized, it used to be fashionable and it was glamorized by famous people and actors in Hollywood in the 1960Åfs and even earlier. Lung cancer and other diseases caused by passive smoking are finally being directly related to smoking and secondary smoke or passive smoking. Restaurants are now family venues where children play and as a parent we should not have to worry which restaurant to go to or which one to avoid because if the possibility of smoking in the restaurant. I am a non-smoker so I donÅft want to breathe in someone elseÅfs poison just because they want to light up a cigarette inside. The hospitals in the UK are now treating many cases of cancer of smoking related diseases and it is the tax payer who has to pay for this. Why should my taxes help to pay for people who want to smoke? Not only is it an unpleasant hobby but it is also a deadly one. I do not want to be a part of those cancer statistics just because people are addicted to a filthy habit. I see smoking as a waste of time and very anti-social. Governments should take responsibility for this problem and protect the majority of the population who do not smoke.
