I agree with this statement for several reasons.  Smoking has been proven many times to have a large impact on the health of people, including smokers themselves and those around them.  It is absurd to allow people to inflict damage in the form of passive smoking upon others who choose not to smoke.  Each year there are numerous cases of health problems caused by second hand smoke which impacts the economy due to increased health expenditure from the government.  It is therefore necessary to take steps to reduce these issues as much as possible, and banning smoking in all restaurants is a step to achieving that.  Enclosed spaces facilitate the spread of smoke and of course restaurants are enclosed spaces yet it is not just restaurants where it should be banned ? all indoor public places should be no-smoking areas much like several countries in Europe and parts of America.  
Focusing on restaurants, it is not only the health aspect we should consider.  There is also the issue of hygiene and pollution.  Smoking is a dirty habit.  The ash spreads easily, potentially contaminating food at worst, or being a mild nuisance at best.  The smoke itself has an unfavorable odor for non-smokers and smokers alike.  The smell of tobacco while eating can be enough to ruin the appetite of a 40-a-day chain-smoker let alone a non-smoker.  It is therefore in the best interests of restaurant owners to encourage the image of cleanliness in their establishments by banning smoking.
