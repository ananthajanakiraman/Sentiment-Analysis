I disagree with this statement for a several reasons. I myself am actually not a smoker, but I have many co-workers who do smoke and canÅft say that persecuting them for their bad habits has been entirely effective. I have two reasons: First, I find it a bit unfair to go after the smokers only. I look around me at the office and I see a few smokers (who can no longer smoke in the office, thank god!) but also a number of large, overweight, inactive slobs. Why not badger the fat people? They seem to be always tired, have a hard time going anywhere fast, and tend to get sick a lot more than those of us who actually go to the trouble of eating healthy and exercising. As far as I care, perhaps they should smoke, they at least get the exercise from having to get up and walk to the smokersÅf room not to mention that nicotine is an effective appetite suppressant. WhatÅfs more, smokers have been turned into less reliable workers. By severely restricting the number of locations they can smoke, they have had to go further and further away from where they need to or should be during the day in order to take a puff. How many times have I wanted to ask one of my smoker co-workers a quick question only to find that he/she was out for a cigarette break! I totally support putting glass walls between the smokers and the rest of us for health reason, but if we go too far, not only will we find that our measures are not effective in cutting down the number of smokers, weÅfll also realize that weÅfve driven out and alienated an entire group of people for very little benefit.
