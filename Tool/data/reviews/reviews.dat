Full 2015 Audi Q5 Review	What's New for 2015		Every Q5 now comes standard with xenon headlights, LED daytime running lights, LED taillights and a power liftgate. Minor options changes include the debut of an "Audi exclusive line" package and the availability of the upgraded, console-controlled MMI system with navigation across the lineup.		Introduction		Audi's approach to building premium vehicles is familiar by now: Satisfy segment standards, then add healthy doses of style, cabin quality and powertrain excellence. The 2015 Audi Q5 crossover could serve as Exhibit A.		Take a look at one at a dealer and you'll no doubt find that it looks great and has an interior that oozes luxury. You'll probably find a Q5 that suits your powertrain desires, too. Audi offers it with everything from a turbocharged four-cylinder engine to a turbocharged diesel V6, throwing in a supercharged V6 and a four-cylinder hybrid system for good measure. Although the Q5 is one of the older members of its class, with roots stretching back to 2009, consistent updates over the years have maintained its leading status.		Audi's engineers have also been trying to make their creations more fun to drive, and the Q5 is exemplary here as well. It really does feel at home dashing between corners on a country road. The downside is that on bumpy roads the Q5 will jostle you around more than competing rivals. If you value this crossover's above-average handling, you probably won't mind; otherwise, you might.		Compact luxury crossovers like the Q5 are all the rage these days, so the competition is predictably fierce. If you want extra sportiness and don't mind giving up some interior space (and potentially paying a whole lot more), be sure to test-drive the 2015 Porsche Macan. Another direct Q5 competitor is the 2015 BMW X3, which, like the Audi, offers varied powertrains plus an even more spacious feel inside. Two other more family-friendly choices would be the 2015 Acura RDX and 2015 Volvo XC60. Overall, though, we're fond of the Edmunds.com "B" rated 2015 Audi Q5. In typical Audi fashion, it has the stylish aesthetics and well-rounded nature to win your favor.		Body Styles, Trim Levels, and Options		The 2015 Audi Q5 is a compact luxury crossover offered in seven trim levels that correspond to the four available engines: 2.0T Premium, 2.0T Premium Plus, 3.0T Premium Plus, 3.0T Prestige, 3.0 TDI Premium Plus, 3.0 TDI Prestige and 2.0T Hybrid Prestige. A higher-performance version, the SQ5, is reviewed separately.		Standard equipment on the 2.0T Premium includes the turbocharged four-cylinder engine, 18-inch wheels (19s are optional), automatic xenon headlights, LED running lights and taillights, automatic wipers, heated exterior mirrors, aluminum roof rails with crossbars, a power liftgate, eight-way power front seats (with four-way power lumbar for the driver and optional heating), a tilt-and-telescoping four-spoke steering wheel, leather upholstery, tri-zone climate control, a sliding and reclining 40/20/40-split folding rear seat, Bluetooth connectivity, Audi's Multi Media Interface (MMI) with dash-mounted controls and a 10-speaker sound system with a CD player, an iPod/USB input, an auxiliary audio jack and satellite radio.		The 2.0T Premium Plus adds aluminum exterior trim, a panoramic sunroof (optional on 2.0T Premium), auto-dimming and power-folding exterior mirrors, keyless ignition and entry, heated front seats, driver memory settings and an auto-dimming interior mirror.		The 3.0T Premium Plus adds the supercharged V6 engine, 19-inch wheels, "S line" exterior styling tweaks, headlight washers and a three-spoke steering wheel.		The 3.0T Prestige tacks on adaptive headlights, a 14-speaker Bang & Olufsen sound system, a heated and cooled cupholder, rear door sunshades and the Technology package (including blind-spot monitoring, a rearview camera, front and rear parking sensors, a color trip computer, a navigation system with voice controls, "Audi connect" online services with mobile WiFi capability and an upgraded MMI system with console-mounted controls).		The 3.0 TDI Premium Plus features the diesel engine but is otherwise equipped like the 3.0T Premium Plus, lacking only the S line exterior trim and the headlight washers (available via the "S line plus" package, described below). Likewise, the 3.0 TDI Prestige is similarly equipped to the 3.0T Prestige.		Finally, the 2.0T Hybrid Prestige includes unique 19-inch wheels, hybrid badging and hybrid-specific instrumentation, but it otherwise mirrors the features of the other Prestige trims.		The Prestige-spec Technology package described above is offered as an option on all other trims except the base 2.0T premium, which offers a Navigation package that lacks Audi connect and the parking/safety features (but includes the MMI upgrade with controls on the center console). Similarly, the Bang & Olufsen stereo is offered on all but the base trim, as is the Sport Interior package (including a three-spoke steering wheel with shift paddles, front sport seats, a black cloth headliner and Audi Drive Select, which provides four selectable settings for throttle response, transmission shift points and steering assist). The Luxury package (including ventilated front seats with power lumbar, upgraded leather upholstery and a leather-wrapped dashboard) is offered on all 3.0T/3.0 TDI trims and the 2.0T Hybrid Prestige.		The 3.0T can also be equipped with the High Gloss Black package (including the Sport Interior package plus 20-inch wheels, gloss-black exterior trim, matte-black roof rails and a flat-bottomed sport steering wheel). The 3.0 TDI's version is the "S line plus" package (including the Sport Interior and High Gloss Black packages and adding the 3.0T's standard headlight washers and S line exterior trim).		The Prestige trims alone are eligible for the "Audi exclusive line" package (including the Sport Interior package plus piano black inlays and upgraded leather upholstery with contrast piping and stitching). Offered only on the 3.0T Prestige and 3.0 TDI Prestige are adaptive suspension dampers and the Driver Assist package (including Audi Drive Select, adaptive cruise control and dynamic steering).		Rear-seat side airbags are a stand-alone option for all trim levels.		Powertrains and Performance		All 2015 Audi Q5s feature all-wheel drive and an eight-speed automatic transmission.		The 2.0T Premium and Premium Plus come standard with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine good for 220 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque. EPA-estimated fuel economy is 23 mpg combined (20 city/28 highway). In Edmunds testing, a Q5 2.0T accelerated to 60 mph in 6.7 seconds, an average time for the segment.		The Q5 3.0T trims get a supercharged 3.0-liter V6 that produces 272 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque, along with an automatic stop-start system that saves fuel by shutting off the engine when you come to a halt. In Edmunds testing, the 3.0T engine brought the Q5 from zero to 60 in a fleet 5.8 seconds. EPA-estimated fuel economy is 21 mpg combined (18/26).		The Q5 3.0 TDI features a 3.0-liter turbocharged diesel V6 with 240 hp and 428 lb-ft of torque; it gets the automatic stop-start system as well. During Edmunds testing, a Q5 TDI went from zero to 60 mph in just 6.0 seconds. Fuel economy estimates for the TDI are the best of the Q5 bunch, and stand at 27 mpg combined (24/31).		The Q5 Hybrid pairs the 2.0T engine with a 54 hp electric motor and a battery pack for a total output of 245 hp and 350 lb-ft of torque. Audi estimates its 0-60 time at 6.8 seconds, while EPA fuel economy estimates stand at 26 mpg combined (24/30).		Safety		All 2015 Audi Q5s come with stability and traction control, front side airbags and side curtain airbags. Rear side airbags are a stand-alone option, while the Technology package includes parking sensors, a rearview camera and a blind-spot warning system.		In Edmunds brake testing, a Q5 2.0T with 18-inch wheels and summer tires came to a stop from 60 mph in 114 feet, an average distance for this class and tire. A 3.0T Prestige with 19s and summer tires stopped in a more impressive 109 feet. The heavier Q5 TDI with 19s and all-season tires took 120 feet.		In government crash tests, the Q5 received four out of five stars overall, with four stars for frontal crash protection and five stars for side crash protection. The independent Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Q5 its highest rating of "Good" in the moderate-overlap frontal-offset, side-impact and roof strength tests, while the Q5's seat and head restraint design was also rated "Good" for whiplash protection in rear impacts.		Interior Design and Special Features		As we've come to expect from all Audi models, the Q5 benefits from classy interior design and top-notch construction. The center stack controls are canted toward the driver, although the layout depends on whether you opt for the navigation system. Without navigation, the knob and buttons for the MMI system reside somewhat inconveniently on the center stack. With navigation, the controls are placed on the center console between the armrest and shift lever, where they're easier to reach. Navigation-equipped models also get the latest MMI system with more intuitive menus, enhanced Google Maps satellite imagery and an additional joystick button.		Despite its compact size, the Q5 manages to feel roomy whether you're seated in the front or rear. The rear seats both recline and slide fore and aft -- a rarity in this class. The Q5 provides a healthy 29.1 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seatbacks, but if you fold them down, the resulting 57.3-cubic-foot cargo hold is a little below average for the segment. The Acura RDX has 61.3 cubes with the rear seats folded and the Volvo XC70 has 67.4 cubes.		Driving Impressions		Regardless of which powertrain you choose, the 2015 Audi Q5 delivers smooth, powerful acceleration, and the eight-speed automatic is refined and responsive. Both the 2.0T and 3.0T gas engines match their respective rivals in terms of acceleration and fuel economy, while the diesel and hybrid versions of the Q5 offer even higher fuel efficiency, yet still accelerate with verve.		The Q5's ride quality is firmer than the norm for this class of vehicle, but we've never found it to be harsh. Just make sure you find some rough pavement on your test-drive so you'll know what it feels like. Handling is excellent, and we consider the 2015 Q5 to be one of the sportiest crossovers on the market. The steering is quick and responsive, though it has a rather artificial feel. Firm ride aside, the Q5 is hard to fault from the driver seat.
2016 Ford Explorer Road Test		by Mike Magrath  · May 22, 2015	View Road Test Specs	Read similar		Quick Summary		For 2016, the Ford Explorer receives noticeable exterior changes as well as the availability of a new 280-horsepower, 2.3-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine that promises 28 mpg on the highway. Thanks to ample space, a pleasant ride and excellent functionality, the Explorer ranks high on our list of favorite three-row SUVs. The new 2.3-liter engine is merely adequate, however, so we would suggest the more powerful 3.5-liter EcoBoost engine option.			Ford Explorer	Inventory at your area	Build and Price your own	MSRP starting at	$30,700	What Is It?		The 2016 Ford Explorer is a three-row, midsize SUV available in either front- or all-wheel drive with one of three engines. The base engine is a 3.5-liter V6 rated at 290 hp and 255 pound-feet of torque. The new midrange engine is a 2.3-liter, turbocharged four-cylinder rated at 280 hp and 310 lb-ft of torque. Topping the range is a twin-turbo V6 that makes 365 hp and 350 lb-ft of torque. All engines use the same six-speed automatic transmission.		The base Explorer, one of five trim levels, starts at just over $30,000. The base trim comes standard with a 60/40-split folding second-row bench and a third row split 50/50. A rearview camera, Sync with 911 assist, a USB port and 18-inch wheels are also standard. A step up is the XLT which upgrades the interior cloth, adds 10-way power driver seat (six-way power passenger seat), Sirius XM radio, push-button start, backup sensors and an exterior keypad entry pad.		Next up is the Limited. This trim starts at $42,195 and is where the Explorer finally gains leather seating surfaces that are heated and cooled. It's also equipped with 20-inch wheels, a 12-speaker Sony stereo, front-view camera, hands-free liftgate and navigation. Then there's the Sport model that gets various blacked-out trim pieces, 20-inch aluminum wheels, a sport-tuned suspension, all-wheel drive and the twin-turbo V6 as standard. It starts at $44,195.		Topping the range is the new Platinum trim Explorer at $53,495. We didn't have a chance to sample this version, but Ford's promising "Nirvana leather with micro-perforation and quilting" as well as a heated steering wheel with leather and real wood, heated second-row seats, quilted leather on the door panels, satin chrome exterior bits, high-end Sony stereo, automatic parallel and perpendicular parking, lane-keeping assist and rain-sensing wipers.		How Does It Drive?		In a word: Big.		The current-generation Ford Explorer has never had particularly good forward sight lines and the hood feels like it extends well beyond where it actually ends. It makes cresting hills, turning left or driving in traffic more of an adventure than any of these activities need to be.		Once you get over that metaphorical hump, the Explorer rides very well. The Sport's ride was the most controlled, soaking up bumps without drama. Even the Limited trim handled highway imperfections with aplomb. There's some suspension softness, as you'd expect, without any of the wallowing aftershocks some other SUVs are guilty of.		Aside from the Explorer feeling bigger than it really is, the brakes are the only other sticking point. Like with most SUVs, the pedal travel is long and that's good. What's not good is their lack of progressiveness as they're ineffective for the first half of the pedal stroke and then jumpy at the bottom. You get used to it fairly quickly, but we would prefer a more linear feel.		What's New Under the Hood?		The biggest news with the 2016 Ford Explorer is the availability of the new 2.3-liter four-cylinder engine. It delivers 280 hp and 310 lb-feet of torque. Coupled with front-wheel drive, it will return 19 mpg city and 28 mpg highway according to the EPA. With all-wheel drive the city number drops to 18 mpg, while the highway number is unchanged at 28 mpg.		On paper, this engine sounds like the much-hyped "V6 power with four-cylinder fuel economy!" solution we've always been promised. In certain circumstances, it delivers. On an open highway, or a lightly undulating two-lane blacktop, the 2.3 settles into a nice, low-rpm hum and cruises effortlessly. We didn't have the opportunity to burn through enough fuel for an mpg evaluation, but 28 seems reserved for only these ideal conditions as the engine simply doesn't cope well with the Explorer's 4,571-pound weight during acceleration.		From a stop, the four-cylinder is noisy, gasping for air as you merge with traffic. There's a lull in the power off the line and then a surprise surge of power around 3,000 rpm. Similarly, when the 2.3-liter EcoBoost-equipped Explorer encounters any elevation, the combination of "too little power, too much weight" adds up to a vehicle that can't keep a constant speed or pick a single gear. It's possible that an eight-speed automatic would provide the right gearing, letting this powertrain find its sweet spot, but there's an easier solution already in the Explorer's toolbox in the form of the twin-turbocharged, 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6.		This motor produces 365 hp and 350 lb-ft of torque and is infinitely better prepared to handle the daily duties of such a large vehicle. On the same uphill sections and merging areas that flummoxed the four-cylinder EcoBoost, this V6-powered Explorer excelled. Beyond simply being able to keep pace, the 3.5-liter V6 sounds and feels more refined. It's never harsh. Never buzzy.		Fuel economy estimates for this powertrain haven't been released yet, though the 2015 model returned 18 mpg combined (16 city/22 highway). And that's not the only hit you'll take. The 3.5-liter EcoBoost is only available on the higher-end Sport and Platinum trims with all-wheel drive which start at $44,195.		Should neither of these solutions work for you, there's one more option: The base, non-turbocharged 3.5-liter V6. This motor makes less power and torque than the four-cylinder turbo yet feels virtually the same on the road. Fuel economy estimates are 17 city/24 highway for front-drive and 16/23 for all-wheel-drive models. This engine not only saves you the $995 premium the 2.3-liter motor costs, it, like the EcoBoost V6, can be optioned to tow up to 5,000 pounds. The 2.3 can only tow 3,000 pounds.		What's the Interior Like?		The interior of the 2016 Ford Explorer is largely carried forward from the 2015 Explorer. This includes the large, easy-to-use center stack with big, colored buttons for climate control and seat heaters/coolers, and Ford's better-every-year Sync infotainment system. The seats are covered in durable-feeling leather and are flat and comfortably wide for drivers who like to shift a bit to get situated. Taller drivers may find the seat bottoms on the short side.		Second-row passengers are treated to dual USB ports for charging and more than enough leg- and headroom. By pulling a strap, the second row flops forward allowing access to the third row of seats which are still tight for adults. There's limited headroom and, really, the easiest way to get out is via the hatch. For kids and short trips they're more than adequate.		When those seats aren't being used to shuttle various ride-moochers, they can be folded flat into a well in the rear cargo area creating a large, flat load floor that'll hold a week's worth of luggage for a family of four. Easily.		No matter which seat you're in, or which configuration you've selected, the Explorer is a pleasantly quiet place to spend time. The suspension makes little noises as you cross pavement seams and there's a slight whoosh from the all-season tires.		Everything else, save for the aforementioned engine noise, is muted. With the Explorer knocking on the door of luxury SUV pricing, Ford has anticipated being held to a higher standard and has responded correctly.		2016 Ford Explorer - Front Seats	2016 Ford Explorer - Action Front 3/4 - 5	2016 Ford Explorer - Action Front 3/4 - 6	2016 Ford Explorer - Front Seats	A Platinum trim level will be available with higher-quality, partially quilted leather.	By Ford Motor Company	What Competing Models Should You Also Consider?		Chevrolet Traverse : The Traverse hasn't been refreshed as recently as its main competition, but it's a solid midsize SUV thanks to its large interior and simple controls.		Honda Pilot : The 2016 Honda Pilot is all-new. It's got a new V6, nine-speed automatic, less weight and more passenger room than before. We were very impressed when we drove it recently.		Toyota Highlander : Thanks to a powerful V6, generous space, composed ride and ease-of-use, the Toyota Highlander received an " A" rating .			Why Should You Consider This Car?		You want a refined and practical midsize SUV that offers a wide range of options and price points. From the fuel-efficiency of the new turbocharged four-cylinder to the luxury of the Platinum model, this new Explorer has a little bit of everything. Add in some innovative feature and a smooth, quiet ride and the Explorer is a solid pick amongst a field of strong contenders.		Why Should You Think Twice About This Car?		If you don't need seven-passenger seating, a smaller SUV would feel more comfortable around town. New turbocharged, four-cylinder engine has the potential for delivering solid mileage, but feels strained under tough conditions like climbing grades. Third-row seat isn't as spacious as some others in the class.		Edmunds attended a manufacturer-sponsored event, to which selected members of the press were invited, to facilitate this report.
Edmunds Expert Review of the 2015 Lamborghini Huracan Coupe		More than just an Audi R8 with a different wrapper, the 2015 Huracan is its own carbon-fiber animal.

ADVERTISEMENT		Full 2015 Lamborghini Huracan Review	What's New for 2015		The 2015 Lamborghini Huracan is an all-new car that picks up the torch and continues in the tradition of the Gallardo.		Introduction		Let's get the potential complaints out of the way first. Some might bemoan the 2015 Lamborghini Huracan's smoothed-over exterior styling, saying that it's lost some of the edginess Lamborghinis are so well known for. Still others will complain that because the Audi R8 and Huracan are now so closely related that there's little reason to buy the more expensive Italian version. In response, though, Lamborghini says the Huracan has less drag and up to 50 percent more downforce compared to the outgoing Gallardo, while the gains in quality, capability and reliability from the German parent company more than outweigh any potential downsides. We're quite OK with both justifications.		The construction of the Huracan is essentially an aluminum space frame with carbon-fiber structures making up the central spine and bulkhead behind the seats. It is heavily related to the R8, but overall curb weight is less compared to the outgoing Gallardo. The revised 5.2-liter V10 engine now makes 602 horsepower and 413 pound-feet of torque, and that power is sent to all four wheels through a seven-speed automated manual gearbox. Hammer the gas and 0-60 mph will happen in about 2.8 seconds, an outlandish number that's quicker than the acceleration time of Lambo's V12-powered Aventador halo car.		Inside, the Huracan looks as if it was plucked out of some near-future sci-fi movie with its covered toggle switches, 12-inch digital instrument panel and podlike air vents. There are some obvious Audi parts on display, but that's not necessarily a bad thing considering Audi is often the benchmark when it comes to interior design and functionality. As for equipment, the Huracan now comes with standard carbon-ceramic brake discs, full-LED exterior lighting and a three-position dynamic mode selector operated from a button on the steering wheel. An adaptive magnetorheological suspension is available and it sounds as if this is a must-have option after nearly every early review otherwise criticized the car's unyielding ride harshness.		Even if the ride was like sitting on a jackhammer, though, we'd still love this car. It's got the image and performance expected of the Lamborghini brand but with enough refinement to make it fully part of the modern exotic supercar era. Of course, there's also the Audi R8, Ferrari 458 Italia and McLaren 650S to consider, or even a Chevrolet Corvette Z06 or Porsche 911 Turbo S if you want similar performance for a lot less money. But the latest from Sant'Agata definitely earns our admiration and desire.		Body Styles, Trim Levels, and Options		The 2015 Lamborghini Huracan is a two-seat midengine exotic sports car that is offered, for now, as the LP610-4 Coupe, where "610" refers to the V10 engine's horsepower (European "CV" measurement figure) and the "-4" indicates all-wheel drive.		Standard equipment on the LP610-4 includes 20-inch cast-aluminum wheels, an automatically extending rear spoiler, full-LED exterior lighting, dual-zone automatic climate control, four-way power seats, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, leather upholstery, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a 12.3-inch multi-configurable digital instrument panel, a multimedia technology interface similar to Audi's Multi Media Interface (MMI) system, Bluetooth and a six-speaker sound system with USB, SD card and auxiliary inputs.		Options include 20-inch forged-aluminum wheels, a nose-raising suspension for driveway clearance, an exterior styling package, a clear engine cover with carbon-fiber engine compartment, an adaptive magnetorheological suspension, variable-ratio steering, a simulated-suede steering wheel, six-way power seats with heating, fitted luggage, a navigation system, front and rear parking sensors, a rearview camera and upgraded audio with HD radio. Various interior packages include two-tone leather/faux leather.		Powertrains and Performance		A mid-mounted 5.2-liter V10 powers the 2015 Lamborghini Huracan LP610-4 with 602 hp and 413 lb-ft of torque. A seven-speed automated manual transmission, known as Lamborghini Doppia Frizone (LDF), sends power to all four wheels through an electronically controlled all-wheel-drive system. Up to 100 percent of the power may be sent to the rear wheels, or up to 50 percent to the front. In typical driving, the split is 30/70 front/rear.		Lamborghini claims the Huracan requires 3.2 seconds for the 0-100 km/h (0-62 mph) sprint, and we've seen 0-60 mph reports around 2.8 seconds utilizing the car's built-in launch-control feature.		Thanks to engine stop-start capability and cylinder deactivation (late availability), the EPA-estimated fuel economy checks in at 16 mpg combined (14 city/20 highway).		Safety		Standard safety features on all 2015 Lamborghini Huracan models include carbon-ceramic antilock disc brakes, stability control and side airbags with head protection. A rearview camera is optional.		Interior Design and Special Features		Despite the fighter-jet-inspired toggle switches and futuristic design, the Huracan provides a fairly livable cabin. Leather and soft-touch materials adorn much of the interior, as one might expect, and the switchgear, gauges and multimedia driver interface are essentially pulled from the Audi parts bin. Some might bemoan this dilution of Lamborghini's traditional Italian character, but most will be thankful that everything actually works. Further advancements can be found in the fundamentally sound driving position and the comfortable and supportive seats.		The aforementioned multimedia interface leaves something to be desired, however, as the display is now entirely contained within the driver's (quite large) digital instrument panel rather than on the center stack or dashboard. The control knob and accompanying buttons are placed on the waterfall and easily fall to the driver's right hand, but considering the Huracan's fearsome capabilities, it might be a good idea if the passenger were to be the one to fiddle with the infotainment system rather than the driver alone.		Furthermore, storage space is negligible, and only the most limber drivers will find ingress and egress an easy task. The latter is par for the course in this segment, perhaps, but some competing models provide supercar performance without requiring contortionist antics to get behind the wheel.		Driving Impressions		The 2015 Lamborghini Huracan's performance is just as otherworldly as one would expect from any exotic sports car. Now with driver-selectable dynamics (Strada, Sport, Corsa), the behaviors of the engine, exhaust, transmission, steering, suspension, all-wheel drive and stability control systems all change accordingly.		The V10 power plant shrieks off the line as the revs climb toward the 8,500-rpm redline. Compared to the 458 Italia from archrival Ferrari, the Huracan is slightly less nimble. It is, however, perfectly at home blasting down the highway and carving through high-speed sweepers and applying its all-wheel-drive traction to maximum advantage.

KBB Expert Review		Vehicle Details	Interior	 Dashboard, center console, gear shifter view photo	While total passenger volume stays roughly the same, additional shoulder room makes the Mazda3's cabin feel more accommodating, particularly up front. In addition to better materials, improved fits/finishes and more user-friendly control layouts, the redesign sees the first use of Mazda's new "Human-Machine Interface" philosophy. Fully implemented in upline models with the head-up Active Driving Display and high-mounted touch screen, even the base Mazda3 i variants have audio switchgear positioned closer to the driver's line of sight to help minimize distraction. Rear legroom still falls on the low side of class average, but there's still room for a pair of average-size adults.		Exterior	  photo	Smart styling on the 2014 Mazda3 brings a new level of elegance to the appearance and proportions of both the sedan and hatchback variants, while helping improve their overall aerodynamics. The recast grille replaces the previous "happy face" with a more distinguished character, and repositioned A-pillars improve the driver's forward sightlines. While the base SV and 3 i Sport Sedan come with 16-inch steel wheels, all of the other 2.0-liter cars feature same-sized alloy alternatives that move to an 18-inch upfit on the 2.5-liter 3 s models. The 3 s variants also boast self-leveling bi-xenon headlights and LED-enhanced front and rear lighting elements.		Notable Standard Equipment	The features roster expands as you move through the Sport/Touring/Grand Touring hierarchy, but even the sedan-only Mazda3 i SV comes with numerous power assists, air conditioning, tilt/telescoping steering column, push-button start, and a full complement of safety items. At the volume-leading i Touring level, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert join the lineup, while all Grand Touring variants feature touch-screen navigation with a 7.0-inch display, Bose audio, dual-zone climate control, and more. All 3 s models add bi-xenon headlights, shifter paddles and the head-up Active Driving Display, while 3 s Grand Touring variants get leather upholstery, corner-following Adaptive front lighting, and more.		Notable Optional Equipment	Optional equipment on the Mazda3 is modest and trim-dependent. A power moonroof is available on the 3 i Touring, while both the 3 i Touring and 3 s Grand Touring offer their own Technology Packages. The former brings 3 s standards like navigation, Bose audio, a color touch screen and the Commander multi-function controller to the mix while the latter adds Mazda's new mileage-maxing i-Eloop regenerative engine-braking system, auto high-beam control, a lane-departure warning system, and two segment-exclusive features – Radar Cruise Control & Forward Obstruction Warning and Smart City Brake Support that helps prevent or mitigate potential low-speed impacts.		Under the Hood	The new 2014 Mazda3 offers two engine choices, both with a Skyactiv pedigree. All i models share the familiar 155-horsepower 2.0-liter inline-4 used in the 2013 Mazda3. The 2.5-liter found in all s variants cranks out 184 horsepower, as it does in the 2014 Mazda6 and CX-5. While the 2.0-liter is still a capable performer, it trades a measure of enthusiasm for better fuel economy numbers – 41 mpg highway in the sedan and 40 mpg in the hatch with either the 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission. The automatic-only 2.5-liter won't stretch a gallon of gasoline quite that far, but notably amps up the car's sporting character.		2.0-liter inline-4	155 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm	150 lb-ft of torque @ 4,000 rpm	EPA city/highway fuel economy:	Sedan: 29/41 mpg (manual), 30/41 mpg (automatic)	Hatchback: 29/40 mpg (manual), 30/40 mpg (automatic) 		2.5-liter inline-4	184 horsepower @ 5,700 rpm	185 lb-ft of torque @ 3,250 rpm	EPA city/highway fuel economy:	Sedan: 28/39 mpg (automatic), 29/40 mpg (automatic w/i-Eloop)	Hatchback: 28/37 mpg (automatic), 29/39 mpg (automatic w/i-Eloop)		Pricing Notes	While not the lowest-cost player in this intensely price-sensitive segment – that honor goes to the 2014 Kia Forte – the 2014 Mazda3 lineup still reflects solid value when you factor in both the content and character of its overall package. The well-equipped i SV Sedan starts under $17,750 and the entry-level 3 i Sport Hatchback starts below $19,750 while at the opposite end of the spectrum, the Mazda3 s Grand Touring Sedan and Hatchback ring in closer to $26,600 and $27,100, respectively. However, adding the Technology Package that brings class-exclusive safety features and the i-Eloop system does bump those numbers by an additional $1,600. KBB.com has yet to establish residual values for the 2014 Mazda3, but based on current figures, this Mazda compact is likely to retain a slightly better percentage of its original selling price than the Cruze or Focus but less than the Civic, Forte and Corolla.

For the senses, there are soft surfaces, attractive back-lit instrumentation and a thick-rimmed steering wheel that's perfect for serious motoring. The seats are supportive for long trips and hold the occupants in place when the road rapidly changes direction. Add some luxury options, and enjoy a leather-stitched instrument panel cover, 2-tone leather upholstery and heated and cooled 12-way front power seats.		Exterior	  photo	There are few more distinctive and purposeful-looking big 4-door sedans than the 2014 Chrysler 300. In front is a big chrome grille that practically defines the meaning of bold, in back are artful taillights, and it all fits into a familiar shape, with a robust lower form and the slightly-small windows of the slightly-lowered roofline, that is not shy about its identity. Details include chrome air-intake outlines and LED daytime running lights. And even the most "base" model looks good, with tasteful chrome trim and 17-inch aluminum-alloy wheels.		Notable Standard Equipment	Standard equipment for the 2014 Chrysler 300 includes keyless entry and start, a big 8.4-inch touchscreen with climate and music controls, Bluetooth phone and streaming audio, USB/iPod/SD card connectivity, dual-zone automatic climate control, leather seating, a 12-way power driver's seat with 4-way power lumbar support, tilt/telescopic steering wheel, cruise control, heated front seats, 17-inch painted aluminum wheels, one-touch up/down windows all around and a full complement of active and passive safety features including side-curtain airbags, driver's-knee airbag, hill-start assist and electronic stability control.

The 300C John Varvatos Limited Edition brings high style, the 300C John Varvatos Luxury Edition loads up the luxury and the 300S with Beats by Dr. Dre is for the audiophile. All the packages are aimed at Chrysler's "Imported from Detroit" tagline. Other major options include all-wheel drive, a variety of safety-oriented electronic aids, and upgraded audio systems.		Under the Hood	For a "base" engine, it's tough to beat the 2014 Chrysler 300's 3.6-liter Pentastar V6, with 292 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. The 300S trim level has cold-air induction and makes 300 horsepower and 264 lb-ft of torque. Both V6 engines have an excellent 8-speed automatic transmission. The 5.7-liter Hemi V8 makes 363 horsepower and 394 lb-ft of torque, and the 6.4-liter Hemi in the SRT8 cranks out 470 horsepower, 470 lb-ft of torque, and a level of performance that will definitely get your attention. The Hemi engines are fitted with a 5-speed automatic with AutoStick manual-shift function.		3.6-liter V6 (300, 300C)	292 horsepower @ 6,350 rpm	260 lb-ft of torque @ 4,800 rpm	EPA city/highway fuel economy: 19/31 mpg (RWD), 14/23 mpg (RWD, E85), 18/27 mpg (AWD), 14/20 mpg (AWD, E85)		3.6-liter V6 (300S)	300 horsepower @ 6,350 rpm	264 lb-ft of torque @ 4,800 rpm	EPA city/highway fuel economy: 19/31 mpg (RWD), 14/23 mpg (RWD, E85), 18/27 mpg (AWD), 14/20 mpg (AWD, E85)		5.7-liter V8 (300S, 300C)	363 horsepower @ 5,200 rpm	394 lb-ft of torque @ 4,200 rpm	EPA city/highway fuel economy: 15/25 mpg (RWD), 15/23 mpg (AWD)		6.4-liter V8 (SRT8)	470 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm	470 lb-ft of torque @ 4,300 rpm	EPA city/highway fuel economy: 14/23 mpg		Pricing Notes	The very well-equipped 2014 Chrysler 300 has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of around $31,000. Add lots of options and the price can reach the region of $50,000 for a fully-loaded 300C AWD. The go-real-fast SRT8 starts around $50,000. To make your best deal, be sure to check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price, which shows what others in your area are paying for the 300. The 2014 Chrysler 300 is strong on price and product, but takes a hit on resale values. However, Chrysler often has a number of incentives and rebates that can significantly reduce the actual transaction price, so be sure to check what is being offered. As for resale, we expect the 2014 Chrysler 300 to hold average 5-year projected residual values, falling well below the Toyota Avalon and Hyundai Genesis, but nearly on par with the Ford Taurus and Buick LaCrosse.

Despite decades of development, multiple iterations and even necessary nods to modern technology, the Wrangler remains true to its hard-earned and thoroughly deserved reputation as the universal standard for off-road vehicles. There's something here for anybody who wants off-road utility, from the simple and inexpensive 2-door Sport with a soft top, to the go-anywhere Rubicon. The longer Wrangler Rubicon SUV offers four doors and a more usable back seat, but it does it all with the same off-road prowess as the original. All come with Chrysler's excellent Pentastar 3.6-liter V6 engine. Competition? Maybe the Toyota 4Runner or Nissan XTerra, but neither SUV has the Jeep Wrangler's off-road chops.		You'll Like This Car If...	Not only will the 2015 Jeep Wrangler let you take the road less traveled, it will let you take no road at all if you prefer. If you want to go even farther, an ample aftermarket is ready to step in.		You May Not Like This Car If...	Be warned: The 2015 Jeep Wrangler is not the kind of SUV you get because you think it'd be cool-looking to drive one in the city. It's loud, the suspension is stiff, and it's short on creature comforts. That's fine for off-road, but for around town, look elsewhere.

There's also a 31-inch tire package available for Sport models, and all Wranglers get a standard Torx tool kit to remove the roof. The new 8-speaker audio system can be upgraded to a new 9-speaker Alpine audio system.		Driving the Wrangler	2015 Jeep Wrangler Front angle view photo	Driving Impressions	With front and rear solid axles and body-on-frame construction, the 2015 Jeep Wrangler is downright primitive by modern standards. But that's what makes it work so well off road. There's...		... generous ground clearance, minimal overhangs, and that distinctive Jeep look, of course. Being equipped with 4-wheel drive, the Wrangler is nearly unstoppable off road. Yet in spite of its off-road bias, it's not quite as bad as you might imagine on pavement. The suspension deals with pavement irregularities as well as it deals with off-road bumps and ruts, and the precise steering is as welcome off-pavement as on. Still, it's ridiculously loud at highway speeds, and its barnlike aerodynamics means you'll use a lot of gas to not go very fast. So just drive it to the trails, where you'll slow down and take advantage of the excellent Pentastar V6 engine and the Wrangler's legendary off-road capability.	Favorite Features	3.6-LITER PENTASTAR V6	Chrysler's Pentastar V6 is the best thing to happen to the Jeep Wrangler since aftermarket winches. With smooth operation, nice throttle response and even decent highway fuel economy, it's just about as perfectly suited as it can be. In addition to the 5-speed automatic, there's a 6-speed manual available.		COMMANDING OFF-ROAD CAPABILITY	If you're not buying a Jeep Wrangler for its off-road capability, then you're simply doing it wrong. The ground clearance, the solid axles, the short overhangs...all of it combine to make the Wrangler excel at its task.		2015 Jeep Wrangler Details	2015 Jeep Wrangler Dashboard, center console, gear shifter view photo	Interior	Very little about the Jeep Wrangler's interior conveys a sense of elegance or status. The Sport's cloth seats are durable, as are the numerous hard plastics throughout the interior. While it's true the higher trim levels offer leather seats, and a 9-speaker Alpine audio system is available, they add comfort, not outright luxury. That said, the rear seat folds flat for extra cargo space, and the 4-door Unlimited models offer plenty of rear-seat room for three people, plus twice the cargo space behind the rear seats as the standard 2-door Wrangler.		Exterior	2015 Jeep Wrangler photo	There's no mistaking the 2015 Jeep Wrangler's unmistakable styling for anything other than a Jeep. The box-on-wheels shape was originally designed for ease of manufacture; now Jeep doesn't dare alter it any more than Elvis could let himself go blonde. The upright windshield isn't just easy to see out of, it also folds down for those times off road when you need to lean over the hood. The wheels are pushed to the corners, giving the Wrangler unmatched approach and departure angles. About the only changes are to trim and appearance packages, like the Willys Wheeler or the Rubicon Hard Rock.		Notable Equipment	Standard Equipment	Two things are standard on every 2015 Jeep Wrangler: A 285-horsepower 3.6-liter V6 engine, and 4-wheel drive with a low-range transfer case. Beyond that, you get stability control with roll mitigation, hill-start assist and trailer sway control. New this year is a Torx Tool Kit, which includes T-30, T-35, T-40 and T-50 wrenches to remove the top and doors. What aren't standard are power windows and door locks. Nor do you get standard air conditioning on base models.		Optional Equipment	The options list for the 2015 Jeep Wrangler is extensive, and again, aimed at the Jeep's core audience. For example, you have a choice of final-drive ratios, with the lower-number axle ratio offering better fuel economy and lower engine rpm for a quieter ride, while the higher number enables better acceleration, and climbing and towing ability. You'll find most of the extras in option packages, like the Black Steel and 31-inch Dueler Tire packages. But there are others, like the Freedom III Package, Trail Kit and Trailer-Tow Package. There's also a huge aftermarket industry of third-party parts and accessories.		Under the Hood	2015 Jeep Wrangler Engine photo	There's only one engine available for the 2015 Jeep Wrangler: a terrific 3.6-liter Pentastar V6, with 285 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Its smooth power delivery makes easy work of highways or rock crawls, and it's easily the best engine ever in a Wrangler. A 6-speed manual transmission is standard, and a 5-speed automatic is available as an option. In the 2-door Wrangler, there's no difference in fuel economy between the two.		3.6 liter V6	285 horsepower @ 6,400 rpm	260 lb-ft of torque @ 4,800 rpm	EPA city/highway fuel economy: 17/21 mpg (Wrangler), 17/20 mpg (Wrangler Unlimited, automatic), 17/21 mpg (Wrangler Unlimited, manual)		Pricing Notes	The 2015 Jeep Wrangler is surprisingly affordable. The basic Wrangler Sport, with the V6 and 4-wheel drive, starts at a reasonable $23,500 Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP). The 4-door Wrangler Unlimited Sport is about $3,800 more. On the other end of the spectrum, a fully loaded Sahara or Rubicon can easily exceed $40,000. Various packages like the Willys Wheeler add about $3,000 to the price of a Wrangler Sport or Wrangler Sport S. Wranglers enjoy historically high resale values, with 3-year-old examples projected to return almost 60 percent of their original window sticker. Keep in mind that if you are considering aggressive off-roading, the fully loaded top-of-the-line Rubicon's $40,000 price is still a steal compared to the cost of upgrading a more basic Wrangler through the 4WD aftermarket.

MacBook review: Apple reinvents the laptop again	For months, the internet was abuzz with two similar, and somewhat contradictory, Apple rumors. Depending on whom you believed, the famously secretive company was working on either a 12-inch "iPad Pro" or a Retina display MacBook Air. To date, neither of these products has materialized, but there's reason to believe that both rumors were actually pointing toward the new 12-inch MacBook. The laptop, which goes on sale tomorrow, is in many ways a traditional notebook, with an Intel processor, OS X and a unibody aluminum enclosure similar to what you'll find on the MacBook Air and Pro. At the same time, it takes some cues from the iPad, including space gray and gold color options, and a slim, fanless design that makes room for just one miniature USB port. With the lid shut, it looks at once like a tablet with a keyboard attached, as well as the two-pound computer that it actually is.		It's the future of laptops, at least as Apple sees it, but it's also not without compromises: To build a machine this compact, the company had to reimagine everything from the keyboard to the trackpad to the components inside. And yes, the port selection, too. All that in the name of building the thinnest and lightest MacBook ever, not to mention the smallest one with a Retina display. In many ways, it's aimed at the same person the original Air was: a loyal Mac user who wants the most portable laptop that money can buy. But are you that person? And even if you are, is it worth the $1,299 asking price?		GALLERY|28 PHOTOS	New MacBook review						+ See all 28	81	Apple	MacBook (2015)		PROS		Attractive design, well-built	Extremely thin and light	Fast disk speeds and startup times	Surprisingly comfortable keyboard	Gorgeous display	Includes more storage and memory at this price than many rival machines	CONS		Less comfortable touchpad than on other laptops	Only one USB Type-C port; adapters sold separately	Can get warm on the bottom	SUMMARY	With its two-pound design, stunning screen and surprisingly comfortable keyboard, the new 12-inch MacBook offers a glimpse at the possible future of laptops. For now, though, its high price and lack of ports make it an expensive novelty, mostly meant for Mac diehards who put portability and screen quality above all else.	Look and feel			The 12-inch MacBook is exactly what it sounds like: a tiny MacBook, akin to the existing Air and Pro. It has a similar unibody aluminum enclosure, complete with a spacious glass trackpad and black keys against a metal keyboard deck. (Stop me if you've heard that before.) Still, this new machine is markedly skinnier than any other MacBook you've seen: just 13.1mm (0.52 inch) at its thickest, tapering down to a razor-thin 3.5mm (0.14 inch) -- about as thick as a stack of four credit cards. Particularly since there's no plastic hinge on the back, like on the Air, the MacBook basically looks like an iPad when it's shut. Speaking of the sort, this is the first time in years an Apple laptop has been available in anything but silver; it will also be sold in space gray and even gold. As much as I would have loved to get my hands on a gold unit (imagine how my photos would have come out!), I prefer the darker space gray color; it's the one I'd get for myself if I were going to buy one.		OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA		The other reason for all these iPad comparisons: The new MacBook barely has any ports. Just a standard 3.5mm headphone jack along the right edge, and a single USB Type-C connection over on the left. And... that's it. No SD card slot, no display outputs. Not even any full-sized USB sockets. It's a sparse setup, not unlike on an iPad, and it reminds me of the original Air too -- remember how pissed everyone was about the fact that it only had one USB port?		Before I get ahead of myself, though, let's take a step back and talk about USB Type-C. You may have already seen these miniature ports on other machines like the new Chromebook Pixel, and you're bound to see them on many more laptops in the future. In case you need a refresher, though, USB Type-C is a relatively new standard, with a smaller opening than full-size USB Type-A ports, and a reversible design allowing you to plug in a cable any way you like. Aside from that, the other main benefit to USB Type-C ports is how versatile they are. The USB socket here isn't just the charging port; it also supports DisplayPort 1.2 video output and is compatible with HDMI and VGA displays, with the help of an adapter. Eventually, the standard will be ubiquitous; I look forward to the day when I can charge my laptop and phone using the same cable. With time, too, we'll see more and more third-party accessories that use USB Type-C, no adapter required.		OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA		That's the thing, though: While USB Type-C ports will one day become industry standard, they're still uncommon enough that you will need a dongle to plug in any of your peripherals that use a full-sized USB Type-A connector. In my case, that meant I couldn't charge my phone off my laptop. I also couldn't use the USB headset I normally wear while podcasting and making voice recordings. If I did want to use my USB gadgets, I would have had to plug in a $79 adapter -- that's right, it's not even included in the box. Again, I expect USB Type-C will one day be the norm, and it's possible that your needs are simple enough that you can already live without the full-sized USB ports.		For now, though, it feels like either Apple is ahead of its time, or it had to settle on a single, not-that-common port for the sake of building a super-skinny machine. All things considered, I would prefer a setup like on the Chromebook Pixel, which combines a pair of USB Type-C ports with two traditional USB Type-A ones. But the Pixel is a thicker machine with a bigger footprint; that kind of port layout wouldn't have worked on a machine as tiny as the MacBook. And that's fine, I guess -- I just don't buy it when Apple tries to spin the one-port design as a good thing.		Display and sound		OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA		With a weight difference of around a third of a pound, the main reason to buy the MacBook over the 11-inch Air isn't necessarily size, but screen quality: This machine brings with it a 12-inch Retina display with 2,304 x 1,440 resolution, or about 3 million pixels. As ever, it's a lovely, lovely panel, with rich colors and wide viewing angles, whether it's from the sides, with the machine on your lap, or with the screen dipped forward, as if you were balancing it on an airplane tray. Every time I use a Retina display machine, I wish that every Mac, even the lowly Air, had a screen this nice.		The audio quality is also robust -- surprisingly so. Any time I see a machine this small, I assume until proven otherwise that the audio will more or less be an afterthought and indeed, the thin speaker grille above the keyboard doesn't look like it packs much punch. In fact, though, I found that five or six out of 16 audio bars was plenty in a quiet room. The quality was also balanced enough that I had a good time streaming Spotify for hours on end; I never wished I had a bigger laptop or a set of external speakers.		Keyboard		OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA		At first glance, the keyboard here doesn't seem very promising: It's so flat that the buttons basically sit flush with the keyboard deck. In other words, it's a big departure from the relatively cushy keys we're used to on the MacBook Air and Pro. Then you try it, though, and you realize it's not nearly as uncomfortable as it looks. It's quite nice -- and in some ways it's an improvement over traditional laptop keyboards.		As it turns out, although the buttons are indeed flat, there's actually a lot going on beneath the surface. Despite the fact that the keyboard is 34 percent thinner, the keys feel remarkably springy and well-supported. As Apple describes it, the trick here was using a custom "butterfly" mechanism that keeps the keys stable and level when you press down on them. The alternative would have been the sort of "scissor" mechanism used on many Ultrabook keyboards. Suffice to say, I'm glad Apple didn't go that route: Too many of the ultraportables I've tested have limp, lifeless keys that wobble and flop around in their sockets. Worse, I frequently have to go back and re-type things on those machines -- and that's precisely because the uneven scissor mechanism causes one side of the keycap to hit the bottom before the key press can actually register.			Image credit: Apple		On the new MacBook, though, the keys feel firmly attached in their sockets, and I rarely, if ever, have to go back and re-type something that didn't stick the first time around. Whereas other Ultrabooks I've used have taught me to type slowly and deliberately, so as not to miss anything, with the new MacBook I'm free to type at a fast clip. My hands feel more relaxed too, because I know I don't have to mash the buttons to ensure a key-register. Much like with the iPhone's onscreen keyboard, which was met with initial skepticism, you just have to trust the MacBook's flat keyboard; it's more effective than it seems at first glance, but you won't fully appreciate that until you try it yourself.		It also helps that the individual keycaps are larger than they would be on other Macs. Specifically, they have a 17 percent larger surface area, making it more likely that you'll hit the button you meant to hit. Even the arrow keys -- usually the first casualty of keyboard redesigns -- are easy to find by feel. Also, they have a deeper curvature than previous MacBook keyboards, allowing Apple to "increase the scoop by 50 percent." (Hokay!) As a result of these larger buttons, the keyboard stretches from one edge of the chassis to another, with barely any space left over on either side. This, it seems, was a necessity: How else was Apple going to squeeze all those big keys onto such a small system?		All told, I still prefer the Air's pillowy keyboard to the one on the new MacBook, but I could easily use either as my daily driver. Both are a clear step up from the flat, gummy keys used on typical Ultrabooks.		Trackpad		OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA		Along with the new 13-inch MacBook Pro, the MacBook is the first laptop in Apple's lineup to come with the "Force Touch," a pressure-sensitive trackpad that responds differently depending on how hard you press. For instance, you can bear down on a word in Safari to see a dictionary definition or a Wikipedia preview. A hard press, or a "Force click," on an address in the Mail app will give you a pop-up map. You can also long-press on items in Finder to preview them or, my personal favorite, Force-click the skip buttons in iTunes and QuickTime to fast-forward or rewind at up to 60x the normal speed. In addition, Apple has released an SDK to developers allowing them to incorporate this feature into their apps, though as of this writing, certain popular downloads like Chrome don't have it yet.		I said this in my recent review of the new MacBook Pro, but I'm not convinced most of these pressure-sensitive gestures are actually useful. Even now that I've had several weeks to play with Force Touch, on both the Pro and the MacBook, I still can't always pull off the "Wikipedia preview" thing in Safari on my first try -- sometimes I merely highlight the word; sometimes I succeed in pulling up the preview box. In any case, in the time I spend futzing with that, I could easily just Google whatever it is in a separate browser tab -- in which case I get not simply a preview, but a full site with all the information I'm looking for. With Finder, I can press down to see a preview of a file, and then, if I press even harder, that preview stretches from a small thumbnail to a full-size image. It's a clever feature, but that two-step press feels inefficient; it was far easier to use the space bar to open and close file previews. If anything, I find the speedy fast-forwarding to be the most practical use case, and even then, I didn't use it often.			The Force Touch trackpad in action on the new 13-inch Retina display MacBook Pro.		Gimmick or not, there's another benefit to the Force Touch touchpad: It's thinner than the one used on the MacBook Air or older Pro models. In fact, I'm not even sure the old "diving board" trackpad would even fit on a machine this skinny. So how did Apple pull that off? Easy: Make it so that you can't actually click on the touchpad anymore. That's right, when the machine is turned off, the Force Touch pad is actually just a stiff sheet of glass that barely moves when you press down on it. Once you turn the machine on, though, Apple fools you into thinking you're actually clicking something. The secret: a "taptic engine" that delivers vibrating haptic feedback to simulate a button press.		It's an impressive trick; I often forgot I wasn't really clicking anything. Still, it doesn't feel like a "normal" button press, if by "normal" we mean the way a regular MacBook Air or Pro trackpad feels. The button here, as it were, feels much shallower than on a traditional diving-board touchpad, where you can only bear down on the bottom of the trackpad. Here, you can press anywhere on the pad, but it never feels like your finger is going down very far. The good news is, you get used to it. Some of this comes with time, although I also found it helped to enable tap-to-click. Ultimately, I find it easier to forgive the new trackpad here than I did with the 13-inch Pro. For all its shortcomings, the Force Touch allows the new MacBook to be thinner than it might have been otherwise. The MBP swaps in a new, less comfortable touchpad, but isn't any thinner or lighter for it.

In addition, Apple also had to redesign the logic board, which is now 67 percent smaller than on the 11-inch Air. The result, as we've already seen, is an insanely lightweight laptop with zero fan noise, though the trade-off is that Apple couldn't use the same heavier-duty Core i5 and i7 processors that it does on the MacBook Air and Pro.		This means the new MacBook will have slightly slower performance, and indeed, that's borne out in benchmark tests. Still, depending on how you plan to use the computer, you might not even notice. According to my stopwatch, the laptop takes just seven seconds to cold-boot into the login screen, making it about twice as fast to start up as the new 13-inch Retina display MacBook Pro. The solid-state drive, meanwhile, which is based on the faster PCI Express standard, delivered average read speeds of 738.2 MB/s in the Blackmagic test, along with average writes of 451.7 MB/s. Mind you, that was under the heaviest load that test allows for: five gigabytes. Even then, the MacBook's transfer speeds are faster than most of its rivals -- and that includes other machines with PCIe SSDs. In addition, the MacBook comes with 8GB of RAM, allowing for swift multitasking and app load times.		OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA		So if startup and transfer speeds aren't a problem, where's the performance hit? As far as I can tell, graphics performance suffers the most. That's not surprising considering Intel's beefier fifth-gen "Core" chips have two-thirds of their die area dedicated to graphics, and deliver the biggest performance gains in tasks related to graphics processing. With Intel HD 5300 graphics (as opposed to HD 6000 on the latest MacBook Air), the new MacBook only reached an average of 21 frames per second in the six-year-old Batman: Arkham Asylum, and that was with medium detail, anti-aliasing disabled and the resolution fixed at the default 1,440 x 900 (as opposed to the max option of 2,560 x 1,600). In other words, it struggled even with moderate settings in an aging game. As I discovered, too, playing games causes the bottom side of the laptop to get hot, especially back toward the hinge.		That's probably to be expected during gameplay, but I also noticed overheating even in more mundane use. Which is surprising, since the processor only draws five watts of power; it's not supposed to get hot. At one point during my testing, I was typing this review in a Chrome browser tab while streaming music through the Spotify desktop app. I only had three browser tabs and three applications open, and yet the heat coming off the bottom side was so intense that at one point I could feel it through my pant legs. To Apple's credit, when the machine does heat up, it tends to subside within a few minutes. Again, though, as I discovered while using Chrome and streaming music, it's not always easy to predict in the first place what's going to trigger these temperature spikes.		Battery life		BATTERY LIFE	New MacBook	7:47	MacBook Air (13-inch, 2013)	12:51	HP Spectre x360	11:34	Apple MacBook Pro with Retina display (13-inch, 2015)	11:23	Apple MacBook Pro with Retina display (13-inch, late 2013)	11:18	Chromebook Pixel (2015)	10:01	Samsung ATIV Book 9 Plus	8:44	Dell XPS 13 (2015)	7:36	Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro	7:36	Acer Aspire S7-392	7:33	Microsoft Surface Pro 3	7:08	Apple rates the MacBook for up to nine hours of web surfing or 10 hours of iTunes video playback -- in other words, the same claims it makes for the 11-inch Air. That's an ambitious promise on Apple's part, considering the 11-inch Air has a much lower-res screen. The more pixels to light up, the shorter the runtime, right? Usually, but in this case, Apple took extra measures to help compensate for the MacBook's pixel-dense Retina display. For starters, there's that low-power Core M processor; the one that sips just five watts of power. In addition, Apple created a new kind of "terraced" battery that does a better job filling out the laptop's interior, allowing for 35 percent more capacity than a typical rectangular battery, according to Apple. In addition, the company used individual lights underneath each keycap, as opposed to the old kind of backlighting technology that allowed light to bleed out from between the buttons. Finally, Apple says the screen's LED backlight is 30 percent more energy efficient than the Retina display on any other MacBook, thanks to redesigned pixels that allow more light to pass through.		I never did quite make it to the "10 hours of video" mark. The closest I got was nine hours and five minutes, which required lowering the brightness to four of 16 bars. What's interesting, though, is that Apple actually tests the battery with the brightness set at 12 out of 16 bars, or 75 percent, according to a footnote on its website. With the brightness set to 65 percent (similar to how I test Windows PCs), I got seven hours and 47 minutes of continuous iTunes video playback. While the battery life isn't as long as Apple said it would be, it's at least in line with what we've seen from some bigger, heavier 13-inch systems. When you think of it that way, nearly eight hours of video playback on an 12-inch system ain't bad.		Configuration options and the competition		OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA		The new MacBook goes on sale tomorrow, April 10th, which means as of this writing it's not listed in the online Apple Store. It will start at $1,299 with 256GB of storage, and there will also be a $1,599 model with a 512GB SSD. There's also a slight difference in processors -- one comes with a 1.1GHz Core M chip, while the other steps up to a slightly faster 1.2GHz CPU. That said, they're both configurable with a 1.3GHz processor, and both come standard with Intel HD 5300 graphics. Other than that, everything -- the Retina display, battery life, 8GB of RAM -- is the same.		So far, it should be obvious that there's nothing else quite like the new MacBook... in Apple's lineup, anyway. But look and you'll find a few similar options from other laptop makers as well. Perhaps the best comparison would be to the new Samsung ATIV Book 9, a 12.2-inch fanless laptop that also uses Intel's Core M processor and has a similar 2,560 x 1,600 display. It weighs 2.09 pounds -- virtually the same as the new MacBook, and measures 0.46 inch thick, making it slightly thinner than the new MacBook. It's also rated for longer battery life (up to 12.5 hours), although I haven't yet tested this claim first-hand. And yes, if you're wondering, it has full-sized USB ports -- two of 'em. The ATIV Book 9 starts at $1,200, around the same price as the MacBook, but for the money, it has half the storage (128GB) and half the RAM (4GB).			The Dell XPS 13 crams a 13-inch screen into the body of an 11-inch laptop, making it nearly as small as the new MacBook. For scale, it's pictured here next to a 13-inch MacBook Air.		There are other options too, but be prepared to make some trade-offs. The new Dell XPS 13, for instance, has a 13-inch screen stuffed into the body of an 11-inch laptop. In terms of its footprint, then, it's about the same size as the new MacBook, and it also has a similarly sharp 3,200 x 1,800 display option. It also has slightly longer battery life, along with beefier fifth-gen Intel Core processors and a wider selection of ports. The catch: It's 30 percent heavier, at 2.6 pounds. Also, if you do want it with that sharp display, it costs $1,300, right in line with the new MacBook, but at that price it comes with half as much storage. If you want, you can also get it with a 1080p screen for $800, and the battery life would be longer too. Again, though, you'd be giving up the Retina-caliber display. You can't have it all.			The Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro also measures about a half-inch thick and uses one of Intel's low-power Core M processors, but it weighs nearly two-thirds of a pound more, mostly because it has a 360-degree hinge.		It's a similar story with Lenovo. The Yoga 3 Pro weighs 2.62 pounds and measures a half-inch thick -- and that's with a 360-degree hinge that allows you to fold the screen back into tablet mode. It, too, has a fanless design with an Intel Core M CPU, along with a 3,200 x 1,800 screen. As with the XPS 13, it has several full-sized USB ports. It also starts at $1,149 with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, meaning it offers better specs for the money than just about any of its rivals. On the downside, the battery life is slightly shorter than on the MacBook. It's a great option if you want a lightweight machine that can double as a tablet. If not, you're better off with the new MacBook or the Samsung ATIV Book 9; both are lighter, and the Samsung almost certainly has longer battery life. Additionally, Lenovo is getting ready to ship the 1.72-pound LaVie HZ550, which packs a Core i5 chip and an optional 2,560 x 1,440 screen. But, it feels flimsier than the MacBook, and last we checked, it was rated for somewhere between seven and eight hours of video playback. That means the runtime is likely on par with, or worse than, the new MacBook.		Lastly, the new MacBook may face some competition from yet another machine in Apple's lineup: the 11-inch MacBook Air. On the one hand, it's a lot cheaper, at $899, but that lower price comes with a markedly lower-res screen (1,366 x 768). Still, there are plenty of reasons someone might get this instead. The battery life should be about the same; it runs a more powerful processor; it has full-sized USB ports; and it only weighs slightly more, at 2.38 pounds. The Air is still the better choice for the masses; the new MacBook is the one to get if portability and screen quality matter above all else.		Wrap-up		OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA		It's not for everyone, but if it's anything like the Air, it might one day become the standard.	At the top of this review, I compared the new MacBook to the first MacBook Air. But that's not totally fair, because even in its first generation, the 12-inch MacBook is a much better product than the first Air was back in 2008. Whereas the original Air suffered from problems like short battery life and spotty wireless performance, most of the design decisions Apple made on the new MacBook are smart; well-thought-out. Even though Apple went with a less-powerful processor than on the current Air, this new model still delivers brisk boot-up times, quick disk speeds and fast everyday performance. Although the keyboard is flatter than on other Macs, it's almost as comfortable to type on; in that respect, I could easily make the new MacBook my daily driver. Also, despite having such a pixel-dense display, it has roughly the same battery life as the similarly sized 11-inch Air. Again, most of the compromises actually seem to have paid off.		The two exceptions are the trackpad and the absence of full-sized USB ports. Don't get me wrong, the Force Touch pad is usable, and I realize it's one of the reasons Apple was able to build a laptop this thin. I'd even go so far as to say that Apple deserves credit for being able to simulate a button press on a trackpad that doesn't actually move. Still, it's not as comfortable as the trackpad on the MacBook Air and other laptops. It's a similar story with ports. I'd much prefer a setup like on the Chromebook Pixel, which offers a mix of full-sized and USB Type-C sockets. Alas, it seems that Apple's decision to include just one port, and not even a common one, was a concession made for the sake of achieving a slim design.		Much like the original Air, the new MacBook is expensive, and it's not for everyone. In particular, it's for well-heeled shoppers who demand the most portable machine possible, and who also don't want to compromise on screen quality. That might not be persuasive to would-be Windows users, who have several compelling alternatives, many with equally sharp screens and a bigger selection of ports. But for loyal Mac fans who wouldn't dream of switching, the new MacBook is by far the lightest-weight machine in Apple's lineup, especially with this caliber of screen. It's not for everyone, especially not right now, but if it's anything like the Air, it might one day become the standard.		Edgar Alvarez contributed to this review.

Dell XPS 13 review (2015): Meet the world's smallest 13-inch laptop	blogger-avatarby Dana Wollman | @danawollman | January 28th 2015 at 12:00 pm	 0	Dell XPS 13 review (2015): Meet the world's smallest 13-inch laptop	CES has come and gone; the holidays are long past; and now all we're left with are a few months of dreary weather. No fun, right? Right. Except if you're a tech writer. Now that most major companies have revealed their new lineups, we have the exciting job of testing all this stuff; seeing how it holds up in real life. The first product of the year to cross my desk: none other than the Dell XPS 13, a compact 13-inch laptop that ranked as a finalist for our annual Best of CES awards. In addition to being the first system we've tested with Intel's new fifth-generation Core processor, the redesigned XPS is notable for its nearly bezel-less display -- a design feat that allows it to have the footprint of an 11-inch machine. Particularly with a starting price of $800 (pretty reasonable for a flagship laptop), it seemed poised to become one of our new favorite Ultrabooks. And you know what? It actually is.

You'll pay dearly to get it with a touchscreen, but even then, it's priced in line with other flagship Ultrabooks -- and in some ways it's a better choice, too.	Hardware		OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA		I suspect many people will buy the XPS 13 purely because of that gorgeous screen, but personally, after using the laptop for a week, I'm more impressed with how small it is. To be fair, of course, I'm a little late to the game: Netbooks and 11-inch laptops have been around for years, but until now, I've avoided them precisely because I prefer the extra screen real estate. That said, with a display this big, the XPS 13 feels like the best of both worlds. Especially for frequent travelers like me. Take my recent cross-country flight to Seattle. The laptop took up less space in my backpack than my MacBook Air would have. It was easier to balance on a cramped airplane tray, even with the person in front of me leaning all the way back (thanks, dude). And for those moments when I had to put my laptop out of sight, it was small enough that I could stow it inside the seat-back compartment with room to spare. At the same time, I had enough space to juggle multiple browser tabs, as well as WordPad in a separate window. After a week with the XPS 13, I'm reminded that weight and thinness aren't everything, though it definitely helps that this thing starts at just 2.6 pounds. Not bad for a 13-inch laptop! (Even with the optional touchscreen, it's still 2.8 pounds.)		OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA		Other than the smaller footprint and nearly bezeless screen, the XPS 13 hews to the same design language as Dell's previous Ultrabooks. Which is to say, it features a smooth metal exterior, with details that include a metal plate on the bottom side to cover up all the required FCC fine print. On the inside, a soft carbon fiber finish stretches across the keyboard deck all the way from the hinge to the palm rest. It's a design that's both beautiful and practical, and I'm glad Dell didn't mess with a good thing just for the sake of shaking things up. For one thing, the carbon weave is nice to look at. Disagree with me if you like, but I think it instantly makes this $800 machine look more expensive than it actually is. It feels nice too, especially if you have the laptop on a flat surface and are letting your wrists hang off the palm rest. Also, thanks to that weave pattern, scratches are virtually a non-issue. Fingerprints too. (The keyboard is another story: I've got a big grease stain on the space bar, where my thumb keeps hitting it.)		OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA		Speaking of the keyboard, I really like it, even if it does require a bit of upkeep to keep the fingerprints away. Despite the XPS 13's compact footprint, this feels like a full-sized layout. Though there are a few shrunken buttons (backspace, for example), most of the backlit keys feel generously sized and well-spaced. Even the arrow keys are easy to find by feel, and those are usually the first things to get squeezed when space is an issue. The buttons also have a surprising amount of travel compared to some other Ultrabooks, with a springiness that made it easy for me to type at a fast clip. My only quibble is that the keyboard sometimes failed to register my button presses, forcing me to go back and re-type stuff. To be honest, though, this is an issue on many Ultrabooks; in fact, it's probably less of a problem here, what with those relatively cushy buttons.		I won't go so far as to say I hate the Microsoft-made Precision touchpad, but it's definitely not as well-engineered as the keyboard. There's just a little too much friction, to the point where I noticed some stuttering even while doing basic two-finger scrolling (that's not just in IE, but in apps like File Explorer and WordPad too). Pinch-to-zoom also didn't feel as controlled as on some other Windows PCs; it sometimes took me multiple attempts to scale text exactly the way I wanted. One time, I actually zoomed in on a webpage by accident when all I meant to do was scroll through. On the bright side, the trackpad does well at single-finger tracking -- an area where other laptop touchpads frequently fall short.		OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA		Though it's a smaller-than-average machine, the XPS 13 thankfully still includes all the usual ports. Well, most of them anyway. Over on the left side, we have a Mini DisplayPort, a headphone jack, one of two USB 3.0 connections and the all-important power socket. The right edge is less crowded, with a Kensington lock slot, a full-sized SD card reader and that second USB opening. There's also an HD webcam, nestled in the lower-left corner below the screen (clearly, Dell had to get creative to accommodate those skinny bezels). Really, of all the things you might reasonably expect to find on an Ultrabook, the only thing missing is an HDMI port. Even then, I suspect many of you will do just fine without it. I know I have.		Display and sound		OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA		Dell's marketing team has taken the liberty of calling the XPS 13's screen an "infinity display." While that's technically incorrect -- you can still make out the 5.2mm-thick bezels on either side -- this is perhaps the closest thing I've seen to a true edge-to-edge display, with pixels stretching all the way across. Also, the screen here has the tiniest bumper you ever did see, which also helps create the illusion of uninterrupted glass. In any case, it's all very pretty, as you'd expect, and it's practical too: You get the same real estate as any other 13-inch laptop, just with a smaller footprint.		Dell didn't skimp on the display quality either. The IPS Gorilla Glass screen (which starts at 1080p resolution, but goes up to 3,200 x 1,800) offers wide viewing angles, which came in handy during my six-hour flight from New York to Seattle. Even with the window open and sunlight pouring in, I could still make out the screen without issue. Also, given that I was trapped in economy, I didn't exactly have much space to work with. Still, whether I had the machine in my lap or balanced on the tray table with the lid dipped forward, I enjoyed bright colors and even contrasts. No washouts here. My only complaint? The XPS 13 doesn't come standard with a touchscreen; for that feature, you'll need to pay $1,300, not $800. Boo.		It's easy to miss the XPS 13's stereo speakers the first time you pick it up: They're nestled on either side of the laptop, toward the front where the chassis gets really narrow. While the audio might seem like an afterthought, it's actually surprisingly good -- among the best in its class, even. The volume is strong enough that I typically didn't need to push it much beyond the 30 out of 100 mark. And while this isn't the most bass-heavy setup you've ever heard (why would it be?), the speakers stand up well to a wide variety of musical genres, from classical to jazz to hip-hop and pop. All told, even when I needed to go back to my "real" laptop for certain things, I continued to use the XPS 13 as my music machine.

Its gorgeous display. The fact that it nearly won a Best of CES Award. In addition to all that, though, this is my first opportunity to test a PC running one of Intel's new "Broadwell" chips. For the uninitiated, Intel's fifth-generation Core CPUs have the same basic architecture as last year's processors, except they've been shrunken down from a 22nm process to a 14nm one. Given that the chip design is generally the same, then, you should expect some fairly modest performance improvements. For instance, Intel is touting just a 4 percent boost in productivity tasks, as measured by the test SysMark. The company has also said battery life could be up to an hour and a half longer than on last year's "Haswell" machines, but even that's just a best-case scenario.		If anything, Broadwell has the most promise on the graphics front. Even before Broadwell PCs started hitting the market, Intel claimed that its new chips performed 22 percent better than last year's models in 3D graphics benchmarks. Indeed, about two-thirds of the die area on these chips is dedicated to graphics. Sure enough, with a dual-core 2.2GHz Core i5-5200U CPU and 8GB of RAM (a configuration worth $1,300), I saw huge gains in every test I ran -- just look at the comparison table above if you don't believe me. By the same measure, general performance, as measured by PCMark, was only slightly improved over machines running last year's processors. Its 10-second boot-up is also par for the course.		Although my particular test unit included a 128GB solid-state drive from LiteOn, a Dell spokesperson told me that some machines will instead make use of a fast new Samsung drive that claims up to 2.15 GB/s read and 1.55 GB/s write speeds, all while sipping just two milliwatts of standby power. While I was a little disappointed not to find that listed in my machine's Device Manager, I still enjoyed some fast disk speeds, with up to 515 MB/s reads and 455 MB/s writes. That last figure -- the write rate -- is especially impressive: Though many laptops can get into 500 MB/s territory for read speeds, most top out in the mid-200 MB/s range on writes. So, Samsung or no Samsung, you should enjoy some better-than-average performance here, at least as far as disk speeds are concerned.		BATTERY LIFE	Dell XPS 13 (2015)	7:36	MacBook Air (13-inch, 2013)	12:51	MacBook Pro with Retina display (13-inch, 2013)	11:18	Samsung ATIV Book 9 (2014 Edition)	9:48	Samsung ATIV Book 9 Plus	8:44	HP Spectre 13	8:30	Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro	7:36	Acer Aspire S7-392	7:33	Samsung Series 9 (15-inch, 2012)	7:29	Microsoft Surface Pro 3	7:08	Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro	6:32	Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon (2014)	6:18	Depending on your usage patterns, Dell says you can get up to 15 hours of battery life with a full HD display, and up to 11 hours with a 3,200 x 1,800 touch panel. On my test unit, which had a 3,200 x 1,800 touchscreen, I got an average of seven hours and 36 minutes in our standard video-looping test, though I bet I could have squeezed out even more runtime had I lowered the brightness to an even dimmer setting (the panel goes all the way up to 400 nits, so even half or three-quarter brightness can drain the battery fairly quickly). It should go without saying too, that models with a lower-res 1080p screen will probably have longer runtime, just because there are fewer pixels to light up.		In any case, the new XPS 13 represents a tremendous improvement over the original version from 2012, which could barely crack five hours (and that was with a lower-resolution screen, too). Just as important, the XPS 13's battery life matches other thin-and-light machines we've tested recently, including the Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro and Acer Aspire S7. The fact is, for a laptop that's this thin and this light with that pixel-dense a screen, getting eight hours on a charge is pretty respectable. And again, I suspect it's actually capable of lasting even longer than that.		OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA		Should the built-in battery not be enough, Dell also sells a spare, 12,000mAh cell for $120 that plugs into the laptop's power port, much the same way you'd use a mobile charger to refuel a phone or tablet. All told, Dell claims that the Power Companion, as it's called, can help the XPS 13 reach 22 hours of battery life. That's impressive, to be sure, and it's also more convenient than swapping out your notebook's built-in battery or attaching a cumbersome sheet to the bottom. As a bonus, the charger also has two USB ports for charging mobile devices, which means you could potentially travel with just one adapter for all your gadgets.		As for bloatware, Dell may have once had a reputation for loading its Windows PCs up with unwanted programs, but the manufacturer has apparently turned over a new leaf. There's very little here in the way of superfluous apps; just Flipboard, Microsoft's own Bing Translator and 20GB of Dropbox storage, free for one year. There's also a trial of McAfee LiveSafe Internet Security and Microsoft Office (activation key required). And... that's it.		Configuration options		OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA		The XPS starts at $800, with base specs that include an Intel Core i3-5010U Broadwell processor, 4GB of RAM, a 128GB SSD, Intel HD 5500 Graphics and a matte (non-glare) 1,920 x 1,080 screen. As I hinted earlier, though, that low starting price is slightly disingenuous when you remember it doesn't come standard with a touchscreen. Not that you need one, per se, but many users will want one, especially considering how touch-optimized Windows 8 is (and Windows 10, when it comes out). If you do want that 3,200 x 1,800 touch panel, be prepared to pay at least $1,300.		In addition, you'll find some mid-range configurations that give you the Core i5 processor with a 1080p screen with either 4GB or 8GB of RAM. Throughout the line too, there are configurations with larger 256GB solid-state drives. At the higher end, Dell is even offering a couple Core i7 configs, one of which has a 512GB SSD. That top-of-the-line model goes for $1,900. All in all, then, you've got a lot of customization options -- more than on most Ultrabooks, in fact.		The competition		OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA		The Dell XPS 13 is going to be a smart buy for many, many people. But it's also in good company: I can think of several other ultraportables you'd probably be happy to own. For starters, there's Lenovo's convertible Yoga 3 Pro ($1,299-plus), which measures just half an inch thick and weighs only 2.62 pounds -- crazy light for a machine with a 360-degree hinge. The only potential downside is that it runs one of Intel's low-powered "Core M" chips, which aren't quite as robust as fifth-generation Core processors. If you need a little more oomph, Lenovo is also readying a 1.7-pound laptop -- the world's lightest 13-inch PC, in fact -- which, despite its dainty frame, will run full-fledged Core CPUs. The only thing is: It's not shipping until May, which could be a problem if you need a new notebook now.		There are a couple other options too, but I haven't had a chance to test all of them. One is the new Samsung ATIV Book 9, a 12.2-inch, fanless machine that uses a Core M processor to achieve a thin design. Of note: It comes standard with a 2,560 x 1,600 screen that goes all the way up to an impressive 700 nits of brightness. Aside from the lower-powered processor, the only real concession seems to be that machine isn't offered with a touchscreen.		OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA		Meanwhile, some of our favorite Ultrabooks have been refreshed with Broadwell processors, theoretically bringing them in line with newer machines like the XPS 13. These include Acer's Aspire S7 ($1,300-plus) and Samsung's ATIV Book 9 Plus ($1,299-plus). Microsoft's Surface Pro 3 actually hasn't been updated with Broadwell, but it's nonetheless a well-built, thin and light tablet that more or less matches the XPS 13 on battery life. If you mainly want a laptop, a proper Ultrabook is still your best bet. But if you want the option of using your device in tablet mode, both the Surface Pro 3 and the Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro are good choices.		And what of the MacBook Air, which I keep comparing to Dell's new machine? I'm sure there are some folks out there who insist on OS X, and probably aren't giving serious consideration to the XPS 13 (or any Windows machine, for that matter). Even if you are Mac-leaning, though, you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you bought an Air now. Don't get me wrong: It's a well-built machine with long battery life, but it's also sorely in need of an update. As of this writing, Apple hasn't refreshed it with fifth-generation Core processors. And that's not even taking into account that a new, drastically smaller device might be in the works. If you think you want an OS X-based machine, I'd suggest you wait, if possible.		Wrap-up		OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA		There's a reason the XPS 13 was a Best of CES finalist: It's not only one of the top laptops we saw at the show, but also one of the finest PCs we're likely to see for months to come. If you're in the market for a new Windows laptop -- something small and light with fast performance and a great screen -- this should absolutely be on your short list. There are other fine choices too, as I've laid out in the previous section, but the XPS 13 is a winner its own right, with very few flaws to speak of. The only things I'd caution you of are the touchpad (it needs a little work) and the battery life, which is merely average, at least on the touch edition. Speaking of, it's on the pricey side if you do indeed configure it with a touchscreen. Even then, though, the $1,300 asking price is worth it.

Another Chromebook. And yet, here I am, reviewing my sixth one in about as many months. Still, there's a reason I'm testing Samsung's newest model, the 11-inch Chromebook 2. It's because it replaces what for the longest time was our favorite Chromebook -- the one Samsung released all the way back in 2012. This new edition costs the same, at $250, but it's purportedly better in almost every way: The battery life is longer; the design is nicer; and the performance should be stronger, thanks to a new Intel Celeron processor. As we know, though, two years is a long time, and indeed, Samsung now has much more competition than it used to. For $250, you could get Sammy's new entry-level Chromebook, or you could also go with models from Acer, ASUS and HP, just to name a few. Is Samsung's still the best after all these years?		GALLERY|43 PHOTOS	Samsung Chromebook 2 review (11-inch, late 2014)						+ See all 43	78	Samsung	Chromebook 2 (11-inch, late 2014)		PROS		Stylish design, relatively thin and light	Comfortable keyboard and trackpad	Decent battery life	Fast 802.11ac WiFi	CONS		Lack of a full-sized SD card reader will be a disappointment to some shoppers	Display offers limited viewing angles	Other Chromebooks offer twice as much RAM	SUMMARY	Samsung's entry-level Chromebook isn't perfect, what with its washed-out display, limited RAM and lack of a full-sized SD slot. Despite those shortcomings, though, it's still a solid choice, thanks to its premium design, comfortable keyboard and long battery life. So, while shoppers have plenty of good options at this price, you can't go wrong with what Samsung has to offer.	Hardware				This might be Samsung's lowest-end Chromebook, but you wouldn't know it from looking at it. The unit we have here has the same design as the higher-end 11- and 13-inch models, complete with a silver, faux-leather lid and fake "stitches" along the perimeter to make it look more like the real thing. The truth is, you'd never actually mistake this for real leather, but it's nonetheless an effective design choice: Although the lid is really just plastic, it looks far more premium than your typical plain-Jane Chromebook.		Make no mistake, though: I don't recommend Samsung's Chromebooks purely for aesthetic reasons. I also really appreciate the company's approach to keyboards. Considering this is a relatively thin, 0.66-inch-thick machine, its keys are actually relatively cushy. Ditto for the 13-inch version; that model has springy buttons too. In any case, this is great news for anyone who expects to spend a lot of time in Gmail and Google Drive, and it's definitely something you'll want to keep in mind as you're comparison shopping: Most other Chromebooks I've tested have flatter, shallower keys. As a bonus, the touchpad also works smoothly -- no issues at all with single-finger tracking.				The display is also nice enough, though hardly noteworthy. Whereas the 13-inch model has a full HD, 1080p screen, the 11-incher I'm reviewing here tops out at 1,366 x 768. That's standard resolution for a laptop this size and price; I wouldn't have expected any better. The quality is also average -- a 200-nit, matte-finish panel that does a good job reflecting glare, but doesn't provide especially wide viewing angles. All in all, then, a pretty mediocre display, but it is worth noting that this is the same screen used on Samsung's other 11-inch Chromebook, which currently sells for $50 more. So, if you're looking at the two variants on the company's website and aren't sure which to pick, that's something to keep in mind: For $300, you're getting the same exact viewing experience that you would for $250.		Taking a tour of the rest of the machine, you'll find that the port selection matches what you'll get on competing Chromebooks -- mostly, anyway. On board, we have two USB ports (one 3.0, one 2.0), an HDMI socket and a combination headphone/mic jack. The one difference is that Samsung still uses a microSD slot to augment the 16GB of built-in storage -- not a full-sized one. If you just intend to load up your card with music and videos and then keep it in the machine, it doesn't matter so much what the format is. But, if you happen to shoot photos with a standalone camera, you might be disappointed by the fact that you can't just remove your full-sized SD card and stick it inside the laptop. Finally, if you flip the notebook over, you'll find a pair of two-watt speakers on the bottom side, which produce reasonably loud sound. I mean, let's be clear, if you want really good audio, you should look at the Toshiba Chromebook 2 instead. But the sound quality here is still good enough for streaming Spotify while you work.

For the most part, the words "Intel" and "Chromebook" are synonymous: Almost every model we've tested uses an Intel processor. In many cases, it's the same exact Intel processor, which makes evaluating Chromebook performance a tricky and sometimes boring process. Samsung's different, though. With the exception of its very first model, which came out three years ago, the company has mostly been using its own ARM-based chips -- and still does, on its higher-end machines. With its latest model, however, even Sammy is jumping aboard the Intel bandwagon: The new Chromebook 2 features a Celeron N2840 chip, the same one used in the Toshiba Chromebook 2. Like many of its competitors, it makes do with 2GB of RAM, though it's worth noting that Samsung's higher-end 11-inch Chromebook 2 has 4GB of memory.		At any rate, having just two gigs of RAM doesn't seem to have hurt the Chromebook 2's performance very much. It manages to beat or basically match the Toshiba Chromebook 2 in every test, despite the fact that the Toshiba unit we tested had 4GB of memory to work with. For the most part, its scores also fall in line with most other Celeron-based Chromebooks; in the case of Mozilla's Kraken JavaScript test, it actually comes out ahead.		All of which is to say, the new Samsung Chromebook 2 is zippy enough for basic use: things like email, web surfing and Netflix streaming. As with competing models, boot-up takes less than 10 seconds, and a new 802.11ac radio (as opposed to the older 802.11n standard) ensures a fast, reliable WiFi connection. And even after hours of Netflix streaming, it still stayed cool enough that I could comfortably rest it on my lap. That said, the fact that this has the same or a similar processor as some other machines means it also runs into some of the same performance pitfalls. When using Spotify's web player, for instance, I more than once noticed the audio cut out briefly when I opened a new tab, or even switched tabs. The last time I experienced that? When I was testing the Toshiba Chromebook 2, another machine that uses Intel's N2840 chip.

That's a slight improvement over the higher-end, $300 model, which also has a 30Wh, 4,080mAh battery. In any case, my mileage varied quite a bit depending on my exact usage, as I expect it will for you too. In our usual video-looping test, I got seven hours of full HD playback, putting it on par with other machines that use the same processor, like the Toshiba Chromebook 2. When I ran the test again, though, this time with a lower-res standard-def video, the battery life climbed to nine hours and 48 minutes. Again, your mileage will vary, but I think it's safe to say that battery life here is as good if not slightly better than most other 11-inch Chromebooks. Well, with one major exception, anyway.		Software				On the one hand, I don't feel like I need to explain to you how Chrome OS works -- it's basically just the Chrome browser with an app launcher and a stripped-down "desktop," for lack of a better word. On the other hand, my conversations with readers and even my own family suggest that a lot of people still have misconceptions about how Chromebooks work. Namely, the idea that you have to be online all the time to use them. Now it's true, when the first Chrome OS devices came out three years ago, you did indeed need an internet connection for them to be remotely useful. But over time, Google has made more and more of its services usable offline, including Gmail, Drive and, as of a few months ago, Play Movies & TV. There's also an area of the Chrome Web Store just for offline-capable apps, so there shouldn't be any confusion as to what requires an internet connection and what doesn't. Besides that, the only other thing you need to know is that every Chromebook (not just this one), comes with 100GB of Google Drive storage, free for two years. Pretty standard stuff.		Configuration options				Before I start comparing the new Chromebook 2 to everything else on the market, it's worth breaking down how it compares to the other two Chromebooks in Samsung's lineup. I suspect you're not cross-shopping this with the 13-inch model, which is obviously larger, and is also considerably more expensive ($350, versus $250 for the version I'm reviewing today). That said, you might be considering Samsung's other 11-inch Chromebook 2, which starts at $300 and has the same 1,366 x 768 screen, faux-leather lid and 2.65-pound chassis. The only real difference is that the $300 model has a Samsung-made, eight-core chip inside and 4GB of RAM, as opposed to a dual-core Intel N2840 processor and 2GB of memory in the $250 version.		The message Samsung seems to be sending is that the performance on the higher-end model is strong enough that it's worth 50 dollars over the entry-level one. I'm dubious of that. The more I use Chromebooks, the more I'm convinced that performance across the board is generally good enough -- I've yet to find one that's unusable. What's more, even when you do squeeze in a more powerful processor -- like this Core i3 chip, for example -- the performance gains are modest at best, and sometimes come at the expense of battery life. If you're gonna go Samsung, I'd either buy this, or spring for the 13-inch model with the 1080p screen.		The competition				Not that you have to stick with Samsung. Almost every major PC maker has at least one 11-inch Chromebook for sale, many of them in the same price range. ASUS' C200 also costs $250, and comes with 16GB of local storage. As I alluded to earlier, it's a battery life champ: It can play back more than 11 hours of standard-def video, whereas other machines struggle to crack nine. It's also slightly lighter than the Samsung Chromebook 2, at 2.5 pounds. Still, that long battery life is offset by sluggish performance, including longer-than-usual boot-up and sign-out times, as well as everyday hiccups, including delays when deleting messages in Gmail or loading new tweets on Twitter.com. Again, though, I've yet to come across a Chromebook that's downright unusable. This one's usable; it's just slower than some of the others.		In a similar vein, HP's Chromebook 11 has received a price cut, and is now around $250 at Amazon. Meanwhile, Acer has something even cheaper: the 11-inch C720 Chromebook, which starts at $200. For the money, the design is plainer than the Samsung Chromebook 2 and the battery life is shorter. I'm also less of a fan of its keyboard, which is flatter in comparison. All told, it's a good deal for the money, but I can see why you'd spend an extra $50 for longer battery life and a comfier keyboard.		There are other choices too, but they're more expensive. Dell's Chromebook 11, for instance, still starts at $300. Lenovo's N20p starts at $330, mostly because it has a touchscreen that bends partially back into different viewing modes. Finally wrapping up, some of you will want to take a look across the aisle at what Windows machines have to offer. The HP Stream 11, for instance, is a $200 laptop running full Windows 8.1 with a comfortable keyboard, eight-hour battery and surprisingly good audio. The performance trails Chromebooks a bit, especially on boot-up times, but it could be a fair trade-off for people who want the option of running traditional desktop apps. On that note, you might also like the $199 ASUS EeeBook X205 and the $200 Acer Aspire ES1, though we admittedly haven't had a chance to test those, so we can't vouch for things like performance, battery life and keyboard quality.		Wrap-up				I wouldn't say the new Samsung Chromebook 2 is the best Chrome OS device you can buy, but that's mostly because it's just one of several good options at this price. In particular, it has a more premium design than its rivals, along with a comfortable keyboard and trackpad, relatively long battery life and fast 802.11ac WiFi -- something you won't find on some older models that are still being sold. On the other hand, it's one of the only Chromebooks I know of that doesn't have a full-sized SD card slot, and it has some of the same performance hiccups as other Celeron-based laptops I've tested. All in all then, it's mostly on par with other 11-inch Chromebooks, which is to say it's imperfect, but still a good deal.

Excellent springy keyboard and trackpad. Super snappy, powerful processor, with integrated graphics. Nearly all-day battery performance.		TIRED	Price -- upgrades, add-ons, and accessories can still up the base cost by nearly $1,000. Sealed unibody design is virtually impossible to upgrade yourself once you've purchased the device.		BUY IT NOW	  |  APPLE	When Apple debuted the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display last summer, we could barely believe our eyes. It was the first time a display with such a high pixel density made its way onto a consumer notebook. It wasn’t just empty eye candy either. The notebook as a whole was a stellar piece of engineering: In addition to its rich 2880×1800 pixel display, it also included a powerful quad-core i7 processor and four-plus hour battery life under duress. And the whole thing was packed into a slimmer frame than its predecessor.	But that was 2012. Apple debuted a 13-inch model earlier this year, and now it’s on to generation two for both sizes. It’s clear Apple has firmly got the hang of the Retina display notebook game.		The late 2013 model has all the same great features as the original, but sports an upgraded Intel Haswell processor (our 13-inch review unit had a 2.4 GHz, Core i5) and gets even better battery life. On top of that, Apple trimmed the price tag by two benjamins. It’s still a pricey machine at $1,500, but the deal is much sweeter than it was for the first-gen Retina Pros.		The new 13-inch model is also slightly lighter and thinner than its predecessor, weighing just under 3.5 pounds. It’s the same uniform thickness as the 15-inch model ( .71 inches) save for the curved bottom edges on its front and rear. All told, the notebook is a half pound heftier than the wedge-shaped 13-inch Air, which could make a difference on your back if you’re toting your notebook back and forth to the office and through TSA lines every day. But otherwise, it’s a small weight burden for all the extra power you get over the Air — especially if you intend to use it as a desktop replacement (more on that later).				The display is, of course, the crown jewel of this MacBook model. As we anticipated, there are far more notebooks with high-resolution displays than there were this time last year, like Google’s Chromebook Pixel and the Toshiba Kirabook. But Apple’s still stands out from the crowd. The company uses a manufacturing method that builds the glossy display right into the notebook’s unibody housing, ditching the extra layer of cover glass of the non-Retina Pro. The pixels seem to sit closer to you, just a few microns beneath the surface instead of buried deeper within the notebook’s lid construction. This display offers a greater contrast ratio (29 percent) and up to 75 percent less glare than the old non-Retina Pro, according to Apple, which makes staring at a screen all day more enjoyable and less taxing on the eyes.		Onscreen text is incredibly sharp, as are vector graphics and high-resolution images. HD video — particularly 4K video on YouTube — looks absolutely stunning. Go back to a non-Retina display or a non-Retina optimized app after a couple days, and you’ll be (unpleasantly) aware of all the blocky pixels inhabiting your screen.		One of our hangups on the 2012 and early 2013 Retina Pros was that Wi-Fi tended to hobble that 4K streaming experience. That’s not a problem now, as the new Pros are joining the ranks of the 2013 iMacs and MacBook Airs by adopting speedy 802.11ac Wi-Fi. You do need a compatible router, like Apple’s Airport Extreme, to enjoy those faster speeds, though. And most of those will run you about $200.		The 13-inch Pro’s 2.4 GHz processor and 8GB of memory is more than enough to handle everyday tasks like word processing, spreadsheet management, multi-tabbed browsing, HD video playback, and casual gaming. Mavericks performs swimmingly on the laptop, but of course any problems you may or may not experience with the new OS are going to be independent of the machine it runs on.				Intel’s built-in Iris graphics have been benchmarked as 50 to 65 percent faster than the HD 4000 Graphics in the first-gen 13-inch Retina Pro. Indeed, apps open in a snap, animations are sharp and stutter-free, and the experience overall is zippier compared to the original model. The MacBook Pro can power up to two 2560×1600 monitors. As has been the case since Apple first introduced a Retina display MacBook Pro, speccing the system out to the full 16GB of memory isn’t a bad idea either as you won’t be able to make many upgrades later on.		Battery life is another area where the MacBook Pro shines. A combination of optimizations in OS X Mavericks and better hardware mean that the 13-inch Pro can easily last you through a 7 to 10 hour work day. Apple benchmarks it at 9 hours at 75 percent display brightness. Apps like iTunes, Safari, and the newly free iWork suite have all been optimized to run super efficiently on the system. I watched two HD iTunes movie streams (OK, it was Hocus Pocus twice through back to back) at about 80 percent brightness and still had more than 50 percent battery left. I’m fairly sure I could have had a whole Indiana Jones movie marathon on this machine and still had enough juice left to complain about Kingdom of the Crystal Skull on Twitter afterwards.		As good as the battery life is on the new MacBook Pro, it won’t compete with the 13-inch Air. I wouldn’t think twice about leaving a charging cable at home if I were taking the Air with me on a weekend trip. That’s still not true for the Pro. Indeed, if you’re on the fence about whether to go with the Air or the Pro, the question really comes down to which is more important to you: the extra battery life or a higher resolution display.		That said, the MacBook Pro Retina strikes an admirable balance between the two. There’s no reason the laptop couldn’t be your everyday workhorse, so long as you don’t regularly engage in seriously CPU-intensive tasks. It’s not the most powerful laptop. And it’s definitely not the most portable. But the combination of a capable processor, an amazing display, a light and slender form factor, and respectable battery life, secure the MacBook Pro’s position as one of the top notebooks on the market right now.
ASUS Zenbook Prime UX31A an Ultrabook with a topnotch display		More Info	ASUS Zenbook Prime UX31A alights its Ivy Bridge at Amazon: $1,149 for Core i5 edition	ASUS bringing Zenbook Prime UX21A, UX31A, UX32A and UX32VD to the US, prices start at $799	ASUS Zenbook Primes with 1080p IPS panels and probably Ivy Bridge CPUs are real, coming to Taiwan in June	ASUS made a grand entrance into the Ultrabook race with the Zenbook Prime UX31E, which brought a sleek design and lovely, high-res screen. That machine was one of our favorites in what was still a budding category, though we took issue with the shallow keyboard and uncomfortable touchpad. The company recently started shipping its new Zenbook Prime series, including the 11-inch UX21A we checked out a few months ago. But there's also a follow-up to the 13-inch UX31E on the market: the ASUS Zenbook Prime UX31A. This laptop offers a retooled keyboard, Ivy Bridge chips and a 1,920 x 1,080 IPS display, starting at $1,069. So how does the new 13-inch Zenbook stack up in a crowded field of high-end ultraportables? Join us past the break for the full report.		GALLERY|25 PHOTOS	ASUS Zenbook Prime UX31A review						+ See all 25	74	ASUS	ASUS Zenbook Prime UX31A		PROS		Great IPS display	Sleek, lightweight design	Decent battery life	CONS		Wonky touchpad	Sub-par audio	SUMMARY	ASUS' new UX31A improves upon its already-good Ultrabook with a higher-res IPS screen and Ivy Bridge power, but there's still room for improvement.	Look and feel		DNP  ASUS Zenbook Prime UX31A an Ultrabook with a topnotch display		At first glance, the UX31A looks very similar to its predecessor. This Ultrabook sports the Zenbook line's signature spun metal lid, all-metal chassis and wafer-thin profile. The laptop feels pretty sturdy, though the lid is a bit wobbly, and the machine picks up scratches quite easily.		ASUS stuck with the original Zenbook design for the UX31A's chassis, but the keyboard is a horse of a different color.	While ASUS stuck with the original Zenbook design for the UX31A's chassis, open the lid and you'll notice that the keyboard is a horse of a different color. Rather than the white metal keys on the original UX31, this layout is black -- and ASUS added in backlighting. As always, though, we'll address the feel of the keyboard a bit later.		At 2.9 pounds and 0.3 inches thick, the UX31A is super light and quite manageable for jaunts on the road. Those vital stats compare favorably to other 13-inch Ultrabooks: even lightweights like the Acer Aspire S3 (three pounds, 0.5 inches) and the MacBook Air (2.96 pounds, 0.11 to 0.68 inches) are slightly heftier. Of course, the 13-inch Samsung Series 9 is always there to make perfectly thin systems feel chubby; at 2.55 pounds and 0.5 inches thick, it's still the gold standard in svelteness.		Unlike the 11-inch UX21A, the UX31A has room for an SD card reader, which sits on the left edge of the machine along with a USB 3.0 port and the combo audio jack. The right side of the system is home to another USB 3.0 connection, plus a mini-VGA port and a micro-HDMI port.		Keyboard and touchpad		DNP  ASUS Zenbook Prime UX31A an Ultrabook with a topnotch display		As we mentioned, ASUS gave the UX31's keyboard a complete overhaul, swapping the flat metal keys for a slightly rounded layout (with black buttons this time). The change isn't just cosmetic -- it offers 12 percent more travel and provides a much more comfortable typing experience than the previous-gen Zenbooks. We typed much of this review on the laptop, with the keys only rarely failing to register a press. ASUS also added backlighting, which is a welcome change. You can toggle the lighting on and off by pressing F3 and F4 (these are secondary functions, so you'll have to hit Fn as well).		We found the trackpad to be pretty unreliable.	Spoiler alert: the trackpad is one of the main things holding us back from giving the UX31A a resounding two thumbs up. We were unimpressed by the one on the UX31E, and though ASUS made some tweaks with the UX31A, it's still not great. When you click on a tab or an icon, for example, the trackpad will often open the adjacent item or simply not register the click at all. Scrolling isn't a problem, though other gestures like pinch-to-zoom stutter too much. ASUS seems to be aware of these issues, and has already released several updates to remedy them, but even with the latest drivers installed we still found the trackpad pretty unreliable. That said, the hardware itself feels nice; the touchpad's integrated touch button is neither too stiff nor too mushy.		Display and sound		The UX31A boasts a 1,920 x 1,080 IPS display, and it's truly one of the best panels we've seen on an Ultrabook. Viewing angles are wide, with images only washing out when you tip the screen ridiculously far forward or back. The matte finish is partly to thank for that, and it means glare isn't a huge issue. Colors look crisp and vivid, which makes watching movies and paging through websites a treat. That said, you may feel the need to zoom in on web pages and text-heavy documents, as the high pixel count makes everything appear smaller than usual. The UX31A is also available with a 1,600 x 900 screen, though we strongly recommend going for the higher-res option.		The 1,920 x 1,080 IPS display is one of the best panels we've seen on an Ultrabook.	We weren't impressed by the UX31A's built-in speakers, which use Bang & Olufsen's ICEpower technology but fail to pack enough power for more than one or two people to enjoy music or movies. More than just being on the quiet side, though, sound on the UX31A sounds tinny and canned. Sure, that's not unusual for Ultrabooks, but we've seen several systems, such as the Toshiba Satellite U845W, provide more impressive audio oomph given their slim sizes, and it would be great if ASUS matched this laptop's top-notch display with a better listening experience.

Its score of 12,494 in PCMark Vantage is not only significantly higher than the last-gen UX31's 10,508, it's also better than the numbers notched by other premium 13-inchers like the Samsung Series 9. Still, the Acer Aspire S5, with a Core i7 CPU and dual 128GB SSDs, outpaced the UX31A by a slim margin.		On 3DMark06, the UX31A came in at 4,989. Integrated Intel HD Graphics 4000 is the name of the game for most Ultrabooks these days -- unless you step up to an NVIDIA-equipped configuration, that is -- and in general it offers good enough performance for casual gaming. Still, the UX31A's result is a tad lower than the Samsung Series 9's, while the MacBook Air beats it by nearly 1,000 points, but many other 13-inchers have scored even lower.		While playing through Batman: Arkham City, we saw frame rates in the 45 to 60 fps range, and World of Warcraft ran at 40 fps with graphics set to "Good." And the UX31A was no slowpoke in everyday use, taking a reasonable 20 seconds to boot, and swiftly handling our multitasking workload across two browsers and several programs.

That's hardly a poor showing, but it doesn't quite take the cake from the 13-inch Samsung Series 9, whose seven-hour runtime is the longest we've recorded for a laptop in this class.		Software and warranty		This machine has its fair share of bloatware, including a trial of McAfee Internet Security (you'll want to disable the pop-ups) and a suite of ASUS-branded applications such as Vibe Fun Center for finding music, games, apps and books. The laptop also includes the standard Windows utilities, including Media Center, DVD Maker and XPS Viewer, while Internet Explorer comes with a heap of distracting toolbars. We enjoyed using the UX31A a lot more once we pruned away these unnecessary programs. ASUS offers a one-year warranty with the UX31A, and that includes 24-hour phone support and accidental damage coverage.		Configuration options and the competition		DNP  ASUS Zenbook Prime UX31A an Ultrabook with a topnotch display		The laptop we reviewed, the UX31A-DB51, ships with a 1.7GHz Core i5-3317U processor, 4GB of RAM, a 128GB SSD and Intel HD Graphics. That model will cost $1,099. For $1,399, you get a Core i7 processor and $1,599 gets you a Core i7 CPU along with 256GB of solid-state storage.		In addition to the UX31A, ASUS is selling the Zenbook Prime UX32A, which starts at $769 with a Core i3 CPU, a 320GB hard drive / 24GB SSD and a 1,366 x 768 display. There's also the $1,299 UX32VD, which is similar to the UX31A reviewed here, except it has an NVIDIA GT620M GPU and a hybrid hard drive.		Starting at $1,300, this year's 13-inch Samsung Series 9 is one of the best premium Ultrabooks you can buy right now. The impossibly slim, sub-three-pound design is a huge boon, as is its long battery life and fast performance. You're looking at a Core i7 CPU, 4GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD, and its matte, 1,600 x 900 screen is second only to the UX31A's IPS display.		You'll have to settle for a standard-res 1,366 x 768 display, but HP's Envy Spectre XT, starting at $1,099, offers comparable specs in a 3.1-pound chassis. The CPU, SSD and Intel HD Graphics 4000 are exactly what you'll find on the UX31A, but its software selection is more generous, as it ships with full editions of Adobe Photoshop Elements and Premiere Elements.		For $1,199 and up, the 13-inch MacBook Air offers a 1.8GHz Core i5 CPU, the same 128GB of solid-state storage and a 1,440 x 900 display. Though that panel can't compete with the UX31A's IPS technology and higher pixel density, the Air does offer a superior keyboard and touchpad.		Wrap-up		DNP  ASUS Zenbook Prime UX31A an Ultrabook with a topnotch display		When ASUS first released the UX31E last fall, we found plenty to like in its striking design, high-quality display and brisk performance. The addition of backlighting and a more comfortable keyboard -- not to mention the step up to Ivy Bridge and Intel HD Graphics 4000 -- makes the whole package considerably better.		But that doesn't mean the Zenbook Prime UX31A is now the best. To claim that title, it needs a more usable trackpad, above all else. We still think the MacBook Air is a better all-around ultraportable, as it offers a more comfortable touchpad and keyboard in a similarly attractive package, though we wish it packed an IPS 1080p display like the one on the UX31A. And though it's considerably more expensive, you might also be happier with the Samsung Series 9, which lasts longer on a charge, rocks an impressive display of its own and sports a more reliable trackpad. Still, given all the UX31A has to offer, chances are you'll be pleased with your purchase. Just evaluate your patience for temperamental touchpads before you pull the trigger.

Sony VAIO Z Series: Ahead of Its Time, Above Your Price Limit		AT A GLANCE(1 items)		Sony VAIO VPCZ213GX/B Notebook	4.5/5	Sony demonstrates cutting-edge design in this surprisingly powerful but unfortunately expensive laptop.		By Jason Cross, PCWorldOct 11, 2011 4:15 PMe-mailprint				2	inShare	0		Most of Sony's VAIO laptops are nothing to write home about. Though they are fine laptops, they don't distinguish themselves from many other modern laptops. They are, for lack of a better descriptor, typical. But every so often, the company bucks common trends with a product that is clearly ahead of the curve--and very expensive. These special laptops remind us of olden days when a Sony TV or music system carried a huge price premium but virtually guaranteed superior design and quality. The new VAIO Z is one of those rare, ahead-of-its-time, money-is-no-object Sony laptops.	The 13-inch VAIO Z is ridiculously thin and light. At 0.7 inch when closed, the body is about as thick as the thickest point on a Macbook Air, though the VAIO Z doesn't taper as Apple's ultraportable does. It's even lighter than the 13-inch Air, too, at 2.5 pounds. This is due in part to Sony's having made the body out of aluminum and featherweight, durable carbon fiber. It looks good, and it feels good. And despite the laptop's incredibly svelte size, Sony crams a full-voltage Core i5 or Core i7 processor into it. Our review model came with a Core i7 2620M and 4GB of RAM. It also carried a 256GB solid-state drive, and the combination powered the system to a very impressive WorldBench 6 score of 138--one of the highest scores we've seen for an ultraportable laptop. Amazingly, the battery lasted for 5.5 hours, about an hour less than the batteries on most recent ultraportables have managed, but quite impressive considering the horsepower under the hood.		Sony loads this thin system with other goodies, too. You get a VGA port on the left; a pair of card readers (for Memory Stick and SD Card) along the front edge; and an audio jack, gigabit ethernet, HDMI, and a pair of USB ports on the right. Sony used Intel's Light Peak technology to turn the lone USB 3.0 port into a special high-speed connector to a thin dock that houses the optical drive (DVD or Blu-ray) and a discrete Radeon HD 6650M graphics card with its own set of video, display, and USB connectors (including USB 3.0). The base-model VAIO Z--with a Core i5 processor, a 128GB SSD, and a 1600-by-900-pixel display--will set you back about $2000. Our review model packed the aforementioned Core i7 CPU and 256GB SSD, plus a 1920-by-1080-pixel display, all for about $2500. The 1.5-pound dock is included with the package, though the type of optical drive it contains may vary.		Though many people have called the media dock port a Thunderbolt connector, it isn't one. Thunderbolt is the port that eventually emerged from Intel and Apple based on the company's Light Peak technology, but with a few changes. Light Peak was going to come to market using a USB port and an optical cable, as in the VAIO Z, but it underwent some tweaking before its designers settled on a mini-DisplayPort connector and copper cable. So Sony's implementation, though it uses very similar technology to Thunderbolt, will be incompatible with Thunderbolt devices. It is essentially a proprietary dock connector, but it also serves as a USB 3.0 port, so there's no wasted space.		The glossy display is impressive, with bright, vivid colors and good contrast. Cramming a 1920-by-1080-resolution full-HD display into only 13 inches is a neat feat, though in our tests the display sometimes made default text sizes look a bit small and hard to read. Off-axis viewing was above average. Movies and games looked great, especially when powered by the Radeon HD 6650M in the Power Media Dock.		With so much to love about this system, it's a shame that the keyboard and touchpad ergonomics aren't especially good. The keys are on the small side; and though they are spaced apart well, they have very little travel when pressed. The result is a keyboard with poor tactile feedback, which can make extended typing feel a little uncomfortable. The touchpad is smallish, too, and it doesn't have discrete buttons, though the left and right clickable zones along the bottom (separated by a fingerprint reader) are obvious. The touchpad tracks well, but I'd prefer a little more size and buttons that are either physically separate or totally absent--none of this “button zones” business.		I'm not a huge fan of Sony's software loadout, either. The drop-down menu at the top of the screen is distracting and superfluous--Windows 7 already has application launching from its own toolbar at the bottom. Sony's VAIO Care application is a good way to keep your system up to date, but Sony's Media Gallery and photo apps don't work any better than more-common software. Sony also bundles in Skype, Arcsoft Webcam Companion, PowerDVD, Office 2010 trail, and Norton Internet Security trail. The last of these is a common annoyance on modern PCs that every laptop maker would do well to avoid; it does a fine job of protecting users from viruses, but it slows performance and nags you incessantly until you either fork over your money or uninstall it. Overall, it's not a good customer experience when you've just spent more than two grand on a new laptop.		These are relatively minor shortcomings, however. The software is easy to remove if you don't care for it, and the typing and pointing experience is by no means poor. The VAIO Z provides a road map to the kind of incredible industrial design and advanced technology that Sony would do well to bring to much lower-cost laptops. This ultraportable is so thin, light, and powerful that it's almost like getting next year's laptop today. Fantastic style and power that's easy to carry around make the VAIO Z a winner, even though it costs more than twice as much as most customers are willing to pay for a new laptop.

Jawbone Up24 review: wireless syncing makes this Jawbone's best fitness tracker yet	blogger-avatarby Billy Steele | @wmsteele | December 12th 2013 at 12:00 pm	 80			Late last year, Jawbone faced a herculean task: regaining consumers' trust after widespread reports of brickage on the original Up fitness tracker. The outfit was able to right many of the wrongs that plagued the first edition, but there was still room for improvement. You still had to plug the Up into a smartphone to sync your collected data; sleep tracking left a lot to be desired; and the iOS app needed more usable functionality beyond tallying steps and monitoring dietary habits. However, the 2012 model did offer more than seven days of battery life and, you know, kept working even after a week of use.		This time around, the company has finally opted to go wireless. Thanks to a Bluetooth Low Energy radio, the new Up24 can sync wirelessly and only needs to be plugged in when it's time to recharge. The convenience of wireless comes at a cost, however. The 2013 version got a $20 price increase to $150. So is the ability to sync wirelessly worth the extra coin? Are the software improvements impressive enough to make folks trust Jawbone above rival companies? I spent a few weeks tracking my every move to determine just that.		GALLERY|33 PHOTOS	Jawbone Up24 review						+ See all 33	80	Jawbone	Up24		PROS		Bluetooth syncing	Simple design	Integration with home automation apps	App can now estimate how long you slept	CONS		Sleep tracking still hit or miss	Battery life took a hit	SUMMARY	The Up24 is Jawbone's best wearable to date thanks to wireless syncing. It's definitely worth buying over the older, less expensive Up band.	Hardware				You're not alone if you confuse the Up24 with either of the previous Up bands. The new offering comes in two colors (black and orange) and sports the same rubber-coated exterior as before. Upon closer inspection, the unit now features a swirly textured pattern around its outer shell -- a change from the zigzag design on the 2012 model. The lone physical button, used for toggling between Sleep Mode, Power Nap and other functions, now has a slightly different texture as well. Opposite the button is the removable nickel-plated cap that hides the 3.5mm plug for charging. Recharging still happens over USB, with the help of an adapter. In some places, the new unit may be a hair thinner, but there are otherwise no significant changes to report there.		The simplicity of the Yves Béhar-designed original remains, and that's a good thing. Jawbone decided not to add a display à la the Fitbit Force; instead it's relying on its companion software to serve up your fitness stats (more on that in a moment). There are still two LEDs, though, and they're still situated around back by the band's button, indicating when the unit is awake (that's the sun icon) or snoozing (that'd be the moon).		One change you'll notice pretty quickly on the Up24 is the reduced battery life.	As with the previous models, you can use the physical button to activate a number of modes. Pressing once still shows whether you're in active or Sleep Mode; just press and hold to toggle between the two. When the band is awake (for lack of a better term), you can turn on the stopwatch by pressing once and then pressing and holding until the sun icon flashes and the band vibrates. Similarly, pressing the button followed by pressing and holding until the indicator flashes and Up24 vibrates in Sleep Mode triggers Power Nap.		Last year's model also brought improved flexibility and water resistance, and indeed, those features are still in play. I was sure to get the unit good and wet each time I washed my hands or did the dishes. Several weeks later, I still haven't had any issues. The Up24 is also just as flexible as the previous model. From time to time, though, the band would snag when I put on a jacket, sliding it about halfway down my arm, at which point I had to adjust it.		One change you'll notice pretty quickly on the Up24 is the reduced battery life. The ability to wirelessly sync your data means the runtime now hovers around seven days. That's the figure Jawbone has claimed, and so my experience was right in line with what the company is advertising. Of course, the band itself will remind you when it's low on juice using both vibrations and a push notification to your iPhone so you can plug it in for the requisite 90-minute recharge. I say iPhone because while there is an Android version of the Up application, the Up24 is only iOS compatible at this time.		Software				The Up24 arrives with version 3.0 of the Up app, which brings a smattering of new features and improvements. Otherwise, it largely looks like the software we familiarized ourselves with last year. First, there are notifications that get pushed to your iPhone when you're about to reach your goal. You might also receive alerts updating you on your progress. For example, after waking up in the morning and switching Sleep Mode off, I got a message letting me know how much shut-eye I got. These updates all arrive automatically without the need to plug in the device if you're using the Up24. There's also a sleep-recovery tool that allows you to manually enter your estimated hours should you forget to enter Sleep Mode before dozing off. Owners of the previous Up bands can enjoy all of these improvements -- everything aside from push notifications, that is.		GALLERY|24 PHOTOS	Up 3.0 screenshots						+ See all 24	Still, the app's main function is gathering your activity and sharing it among your "Team" of friends. Whether this provides adequate motivation or ongoing humiliation depends entirely on how active you are. As a way of keeping morale up, Jawbone's added two new progress features. "Today I Will" allows you to take things one day at time by setting goals like drinking eight glasses of water or packing in seven hours of sleep. Then there are Milestones. These are longer-term achievements like walking a million steps or hitting a certain goal two weeks in a row. In addition, you can still use the Trends view to keep tabs on your activity over the past few days, weeks and months. Meanwhile, the Recent Activities and Lifeline views organize your data into handy visual lists and graphs.		Like the previous build of the app, version 3.0 can still be used in tandem with a number of other applications if you're into the Internet of Things as a way of life. During the course of this review, I tied my account to RunKeeper, MyFitnessPal and If This Then That (IFTTT). As you might expect, integration with IFTTT opens up a whole new world of possibilities. Have a set of Philips Hue lights? You can program those to come on when you take the Up24 out of Sleep Mode or after you've been asleep for eight hours. The band can also trigger events with SmartThings and Belkin's WeMo power outlets (like turning on a coffee pot). And now those apps can all be activated wirelessly at the touch of a button, making the Up24 a part of your automated setup as well.		Food Tracking is back with a built-in barcode scanner. As ever, too, you can add images of your own choosing. Unfortunately, the food catalog isn't the most comprehensive and you'll have to manually add any items that aren't on the list. Once you log your food (Frosted Flakes, for example), it shows up in your activity feed for all of your friends to see. For both of those reasons, I found it easier and much less incriminating to log my meals via MyFitnessPal, a competing food tracker. Chances are, if you're already using MyFitnessPal to monitor your diet, you've already added items you consume regularly, and you're used to a much more robust database. Ditto if you're on Weight Watchers.		Sleep tracking and alarms				Sleep tracking on the original Up was pretty hit or miss. If you were hoping that the situation would be remedied with the Up24, that's unfortunately not the case... for the most part, anyway. If you're a so-called active sleeper like I am, go ahead and prepare yourself for sleep reports in the morning that are split into multiple segments. A couple of nights a week, my sleep pattern showed that I slept for three hours and then four hours or some such, even though I never actually woke up. This nocturnal tracking system still distinguishes between deep and light sleep, so perhaps my thrashing around was mistaken for a 2 AM trip to the restroom. Who knows?		With the Up24, you can now set Smart Alarms via the app, thanks to that newfangled wireless connection. Each time I set one, it went off as promised within that 30-minute light-sleep window, using vibrations to ensure I didn't wake up my wife as well. Power Nap, meanwhile, will activate the same vibrating alarm after you've snagged about 26 minutes of shut-eye. The Idle Alarm is also back to remind you to get up from your desk after a certain amount of time (these intervals are customizable). Finally, as mentioned a few times already, all three of these can be programmed via the app without the need to ever plug in the band.		The competition		Jawbone Up24 review: wireless syncing makes this Jawbone's best fitness tracker yet		As far as we're concerned, the Up24's inclusion of Bluetooth connectivity makes it a no-brainer over the previous Up -- even if it is $20 more expensive. For $50 less, the Fitbit Flex offers wireless syncing, a sleek design and an LED display allowing you to keep an eye on your stats, but its sleep tracker doesn't work reliably. The outfit also offers the $130 Force with similar features and a slightly larger OLED panel and especially long battery life: 11 days, according to our tests. Unfortunately, the software experience for Fitbit's devices is cumbersome to use, and also lacking in certain areas. Then again, food tracking -- the area where Fitbit is particularly weak -- is not a strong suit for Jawbone either.		Then there's Nike's $150 FuelBand SE. Though it has a similarly sleek design as its predecessor, and also works the same way, it houses a larger battery that only needs charging once a week. It also brings improved social networking integration, if you find that helpful for keeping your workouts on track. Still, we found the new software features like Sessions to be rather hit or miss. Oh, and there's still no Android app, with no sign of one arriving anytime soon.		Wrap-up				After some quality time with the Up24, I can definitely say that this is Jawbone's best activity tracker yet. Sure, the software still needs some polish, and the sleep-tracking feature can still be imprecise, but we're excited about the possibility for even more integration with third-party apps. It is worth noting that the Up24 is also the company's most expensive fitness device to date and sits just on the upper end of what we'd be willing to pay for such a device. And don't forget that last year's Up is still available for $130. Even so, we'd recommend shelling out the extra 20 bucks for the convenience of Bluetooth connectivity. Because let's face it: Taking the unit off to sync every day means you might not be using it at all a few months down the road.

Apple Watch review: a status symbol for iOS devotees		​Mankind's fascination with watches capable of more than simply telling the time is nothing new. But recently, our collective interest in intelligent timepieces has spiked, and we have more and more powerful wrist-worn computers to choose from than ever -- whether made by startups with record-setting Kickstarter campaigns or the biggest names in consumer electronics. Of course, the biggest name of all, Apple, had yet to release one of its own. Well, the Watch has arrived, and its maker has loftier aspirations for it than the smartwatches preceding it. Apple's Watch isn't some utilitarian gadget -- it's jewelry, an object of lust, not only for what it can do, but also for how it looks.		I'm not a watch person. Haven't worn one regularly since high school (I'm 33 years old now), and have never been enamored with the likes of Rolex or Longines. But the Apple Watch is, of course, much more than a mere time teller, and the company expects to sell a lot of these things to people like me -- you don't build a $700 billion company selling niche products, after all. The question is: Why would someone like me want one?		GALLERY|51 PHOTOS	Apple Watch review						+ See all 51	79	Apple	Watch		PROS		Finely crafted hardware	Strong app support	Lots of personalization options	Easy-to-use fitness tracking	Best smartwatch available	CONS		Third-party apps can feel sluggish	Some users will crave more control over notification settings	Expensive	SUMMARY	The Watch is the nicest smartwatch available, but it's more status symbol than wearable revolutionary. Most of the Watch's features can be categorized as nice to have (at best) or superfluous (at worst). As such, if you're not enamored with the Watch's appearance, it's probably not compelling enough to buy one.	Hardware				For the uninitiated, there are two sizes (38 or 42mm) and three Watch models: Sport, Watch and Edition. The entry-level Sport model starts at $349 and is made of aluminum, while the high-end Edition starts at $10,000 and is crafted of 18-karat rose or yellow gold. Apple loaned me a 42mm stainless steel Watch model ($549) with a bright, lime green Sport Band ($49 when sold separately) and a Link Bracelet ($449).		In keeping with its aspirations to luxury jewelry and with Apple's usual obsessive attention to detail, the Watch case I received is constructed of machined, cold-forged steel polished to a high gloss. Its OLED screen on top and heart rate sensor on the bottom are sheathed in sapphire crystal, a material familiar to any luxe timepiece aficionado. (Note: Sport models make do without the sapphire protection.) The "Digital Crown" on the right edge is machined and polished too, as is the button with an ever-so-slightly chamfered edge alongside it. All of these elements are fitted together perfectly, with uniform gaps and nary a blemish to be found. The result is a watch that looks the part it's been cast to play -- assuming you dig the aesthetics of a rounded rectangle parked on your arm.		It's the finest construction of any smartwatch I've seen, and none of the others are particularly close (second place: ASUS ZenWatch). More importantly (for Apple), it doesn't feel ridiculous to compare its build quality to something made by Tag Heuer or Cartier.				The Sport Band is made of a pliable, soft-touch material called fluoroelastomer and can be had in white, blue, pink and black in addition to the green I received. The Link Bracelet's made of brushed stainless steel (a Space Black Stainless Steel Watch and matching bracelet are also available, though the black bracelet isn't available for purchase separately). There's a plethora of other straps available for the Watch made of metal and leather, as well.		While I'm not wild about the color of the Sport Band I've been using, the green cuts a striking image on my wrist, and has garnered my Watch far more (favorable) attention on the street than when I've worn the metal bracelet. As you might expect, the rubbery Sport Band is the more comfortable of the two, and even though it's a more casual look, I am impressed with its fit and finish; there's not a seam to be found on the thing, which keeps it looking and feeling premium (for a rubber strap).		Meanwhile, the Link Bracelet is a marvelous bit of engineering, with a unique quad-hinged clasp that latches and releases with rifle-bolt precision. It also has links that can be removed with a simple button press, which makes fitting the bracelet a relatively painless process. Pressing the release button while pulling on the appropriate links required more fiddling than I expected, but it also gets easier the more times you do it. The bracelet is comprised of a single band of horizontal scales, which sets it apart visually from the three or four vertical bands of links in most other watch bracelets. The effect reminds me of the scales you find on the belly of a snake, and I dig the simplicity.				When combined with the polished steel Watch case, however, the brushed finish on the bracelet looks incongruous to my eye. Not to the point of distraction, but for a company that so sweats the little things like Apple does, I'm surprised that such a choice was made. At least it matches the bracelet in its precision construction, and the two fit together almost seamlessly.		Getting started			Setting up the Watch is straightforward. Upon powering it up for the first time, it'll prompt you to pick a language, then open up the Watch app -- which is included with iOS 8.3 -- on your iPhone 5 or later. Tap the 'Start Pairing' option on your Watch and a dancing point cloud (think of it as a beautiful QR code) appears. Point your phone's camera at the Watch's screen, and once the point cloud forms itself into a circular rosette, presto! You're paired. Then, you'll need to agree to the terms and conditions, link up your Apple ID, create a Watch-specific passcode and let it sync all of the compatible apps and info with your iPhone. The whole process takes less than 10 minutes.		Apple's Watch display is an OLED unit which, in the 42mm version has a 390 x 312 resolution that performs well in just about any lighting condition. Colors are vibrant; blacks are inky; and it's viewable in direct sunlight, despite washing out (as is the case with every screen I've ever used in such conditions).		The default mode for that screen is off, but it wakes up when you either touch it or twist your wrist so the Watch thinks you're looking at it. Much digital ink has been spilled about the split-second delay between raising your wrist and seeing the time, and it is noticeable, but I found the slight impediment didn't bother me. The bigger issue is when the first arm motion fails to trigger the display, which forces you to either repeat the process or tap the screen to wake it up.				Should you have more than one Watch band to choose from, swapping them is a similarly easy affair. On the underside of the Watch sit two-flush mounted buttons that serve to release each side of the band, and those buttons need only be depressed slightly, if deliberately, to release. Sliding the ends out of the channels milled into the top and bottom edges of the Watch in which they reside isn't hard, although doing so smoothly took a few tries before I got the hang of it. Also, re-inserting the Link Bracelet requires sliding the tip of one side in before seating the other and pushing them both in simultaneously. Once you feel a muted "snick" on both sides, your band of choice is secure.		The mechanism is brilliant in its simplicity and execution, and makes swapping straps a far simpler process than the pin system on your standard watchband or a trip to the jewelers. Given the wide selection of straps Apple is offering out of the gate (and with more to come, no doubt), this feature is of greater importance than you might think. Any wearable device aspiring to be fashionable has to look good, and the ability to tailor colors and styles to taste so easily is key to the Watch's appeal. (And, in what I'm sure is a completely unintended side effect, this portends greater commercial success -- buying multiple bands makes less sense if you have to head to the nearest jeweler to change them.)		But tailoring the physical look is only part of the equation. Apple has built in digital personalization options, too. The company has put together a user guide that comprehensively elucidates all that the Watch can do, so for the purposes of this review, I'll stick to the highlights.		In use				Generally speaking, the modes of interaction on the Watch's user interface are straightforward, if not always intuitive. In keeping with its primary function, your homescreen is, naturally, a watch face, with the app launcher cloud hidden a layer below. Accessing it is a mere press of the Digital Crown away. Press it again and you're taken back to your watch face. I found it helpful to think of depressing that crown as a sort of analogue for the iPhone's home button, as double-clicking it also takes you straight back to the last app you've used. Scrolling through options and zooming in and out with that little knob made perfect sense from the start -- I'm all about reducing fingerprints on shiny gadget surfaces, and the crown helps curb those smudges.		Another unique bit of UI comes in the form of Apple's new Taptic Engine, a linear actuator that delivers haptic feedback. Far from a mere buzz or vibration, the engine delivers more detailed and nuanced tactile feedback, that in effect is not unlike Immersion's HD haptic technology. Differentiating between the sensation of the different sorts of taps and rumbles it provides isn't easy at first, but the more I felt the feedback, the more attuned I became.		Aside from the watch, app tray and individual applications, the Watch comes with a feature called Glances. A swipe up on the watch face drops you into a carousel of widgets for various apps and functions to let you get a quick look at battery life, the weather, or scores from teams you follow. You can add and subtract Glances in the companion iPhone app, though the only one I really found useful was a status screen that shows if the Watch is connected to your phone and lets you toggle airplane, do-not-disturb and silent modes. You can also ping your iPhone if you've misplaced it.		While the UI does take some getting used to, I settled into using the Digital Crown/touchscreen combo after a couple of days, and after a week, using the Watch became second nature.		Timekeeper				The Watch comes with 10 faces preloaded, and each can be adjusted to varying degrees. There's also a creation engine that lets you make and save variations of those faces for quick access. To swap or tweak one, you'll need to utilize Force Touch, Apple's recently introduced tech that enables the Watch's display (and the new MacBook's trackpad) to distinguish a light tap from a hard press. Jamming your finger into the screen isn't necessary, but you do need to apply significant pressure for the Watch to recognize what you're trying to do.		Upon force pressing, the Watch gives you a horizontal carousel of the available faces. Swiping left and right gets you where you want to go, and any faces that can be customized have a button telling you so beneath them. Tap that button, and again, swiping right and left navigates the modes of adjustment. There are two main ways to tailor the faces: first, color. Wind the crown from top to bottom, and the hue of the words, numbers and watch hands change from salmon pink, to purple, blue, green, yellow, orange, red and finally, white.		Next, you can adjust a series of widgets on the faces, called complications in watchmaking parlance. Depending upon the face chosen, you've got three to five complications to work with. Tapping on a given widget lets you change it, and turning the crown rolls through the options. These include: date, calendar events, moon phase, sunrise and sunset times, weather, stocks, activity summary, alarm, timer, stopwatch, battery charge and world clock. Fans of simplicity can also turn any and all complications off.				Additionally, the Motion face lets you choose among beautiful animations of different butterflies, flowers or jellyfish, while the Chronograph lets you change the watch face itself to black, navy, brown, forest green, dark gray or parchment color.		Two of the faces I found most appealing, Solar and Astronomy, don't support such modding. They are, however, interactive and dynamic. Astronomy lets you swap among views of the Earth, the moon and the solar system (and spinning the crown lets you zoom forward and backward in time, spinning the celestial bodies and the sun's shadow accordingly). Solar displays the sun's position in the sky via a parabolic arc and horizon line and similarly, rotating the crown slides it along that arc. As it does so, the corona emanating from the sun changes to emulate the lighting of dawn, dusk, high noon and all other times before and after solar midnight.		Communicator				Some notifications on the Watch are actionable -- such as archiving Gmail messages -- though most are simply informational. Each is accompanied by a short pop or ding and/or a bit of haptic feedback. Both the sounds and vibrations can be turned on and off individually to suit your tastes or differentiate between types of notifications. Should you miss an alert when it first comes through, the next time you check the Watch, a small red dot appears on screen (or not, if you choose to turn that feature off) letting you know. A swipe down puts you in the notification tray, and if you want to dismiss all of them at once, a simple Force Touch does the trick.		Plenty of others have complained about a lack of granular controls for notifications, but I didn't find it to be a problem. Really, having notifications mirror behavior from the iPhone or simply switching them off was all the control I needed. It's just a matter of figuring out what sorts of pings you want on your wrist: either just the important stuff, or the full fire hose of digital info.		You can make and take phone calls, send and receive text messages or use Apple's Watch-specific Digital Touch comms technology to send finger paintings, taps, animated emoji and even a facsimile of your heartbeat to your closest friends. Using the Watch to take calls is a middling-to-poor experience, though being able to mute an incoming call by covering the Watch is a handy feature. In a quiet, private place, it's a "good enough" sort of thing, with mediocre audio at limited volume being pumped out of the Watch's speaker. In public? Forget about it. Aside from the obvious lack of privacy and inconsiderate nature of forcing those around you to endure your conversation, you can't hear what the person on the other end is saying when there's any sort of ambient noise. The novelty of talking and listening to my wrist dissipated after just a few calls.				Messaging is, by far, the most useful of the Watch's communication abilities. Using the app, you can receive, reply to and send texts, and Apple's made replying to messages, in particular, even easier than on an iPhone. See, the Watch provides a list of (mostly) contextually relevant replies you can simply tap to use instead of typing out a response. You can also use Siri to dictate text replies or send audio messages -- the voice dictation mostly works well, but plenty of times, there's an interminable delay (sometimes of 15 seconds or more) between when I'd speak my reply and when Siri would recognize it. Still, I found messaging via the Watch a feature worth having, as it was often more convenient to deal with texts there than on my phone.		Apple's made much ado about its Digital Touch technology, which, in theory, provides a more personal way to communicate. The tech enables you to tap, draw pictures or scribble words on the Watch screen and have it mirrored on your friend's Watch, even if it's a world away. You can also send your heartbeat by pressing and holding two fingers against the screen for a few seconds. In order to digitally touch someone, they also need to be added to your Friends circle in the iPhone app. In practice, I found it difficult to find the appeal of this mode of communication. I'm a poor artist; my handwriting looks like chicken scratch; and nobody would ever accuse me of being a romantic. Plus, I only had a couple of other Watch owners available in my contacts with which to experiment.		Fitness and health tracker				Despite my svelte frame, I'm no workout warrior. In fact, I'm one of the laziest people I know. (I will not apologize for this. Gormans are naturally a tall and skinny people.) Because of this, I greatly appreciate Apple's multi-pronged, relatively frictionless approach to activity tracking. When first firing up the app, it prompts you to input your sex, age, weight, height and general activity level in terms of daily calorie burn. The app uses this information to recommend daily movement and exercise goals that can be adjusted manually as well. The app tracks you three ways using the Watch's accelerometer: Move, Stand and Exercise. The aim is to give a comprehensive look at your daily activity and motivate you to stop being such a slothful meatbag.		Move is a calorie counter. Stand tracks how sedentary you are on an hourly basis (and prompts you to get up for at least one minute out of every hour). Exercise keeps up with how much time you've spent on any activity as or more strenuous than a brisk walk, with the aim of getting 30 minutes of exercise each day. I can't say the Activity app has made me become more active, yet, but it has made me mindful of my activity level (or lack thereof) -- and therefore I aspire to be more active. Baby steps, right?				There's also a separate, more comprehensive Workout app that integrates with the Activity app. The app lets you choose from a set list of types of exercise (walking, biking, elliptical, rowing machine, etc.). It uses that information, plus the accelerometer and heart rate sensor in the Watch, along with the GPS and WiFi in your iPhone to measure distance covered and (if you have an iPhone 6) elevation gained and lost. All those elements working in concert enable the Watch, according to Apple, to compute a more accurate estimate of your calorie burn during workouts.		Navigation, payments, music and more		There are a few other miscellaneous features of the Watch that are of particular value, I found. First among these is Maps. Issues with Apple Maps itself aside, the implementation of it on the Watch is quite useful, especially when used in tandem with the iPhone. While you can search for locations using Siri on the Watch, I found it preferable to map my routes using my phone and then let the Watch handle telling me where to go. It does so with visual cues and haptic feedback. The tap pattern is different for right and left turns, though apparently my tactile perception is pretty weak at this point. I've yet to tell the two apart by feel alone. I imagine they will become easier to differentiate as I grow attuned to the sensations.		Apple Pay is also, of course, a part of the Watch experience. You add credit cards through the iPhone Watch app -- and even if your iPhone already has Pay activated, you'll need to re-add your card for the Watch -- and you must have a four-digit Watch passcode enabled. Using Pay is easy. Once you're set up, press the lone button on the Watch twice and your available credit cards pop up on screen. Choose the one you want; hold your wrist near the reader until you hear the beep; and you're good to go.				The Watch also lets you store up to 2GB or about 250 songs on board, though you'll need a Bluetooth speaker or headphones to actually, you know, listen to those tunes.		Lastly, a word about third-party Watch apps. I've only tried a handful of the over 3,000 available, but the ones I have used are buggy and slow. I'm chalking this up to them being built for a wholly new software platform and developers need some time to optimize them. I therefore don't find it necessary or useful to spend time evaluating them here. I will say that it bodes well for Apple to have such a huge catalog of apps at launch, and I expect to see more and better software in the months to come.		Battery life				I'll admit, coming into this review, I expected that having to charge the Watch nightly would be a chore. I was wrong. Because of the nifty magnetic induction-charging disc and the fact that I'd never sleep wearing a Watch anyway, charging it up each night just isn't a big deal. (Though having to pack one more charging cable in my bag when I travel is certainly an irritation). As for battery life, well, I've made it through every day with at least 15 percent and sometimes over 50 percent of charge left when I hit the sack. Most importantly, I never once found myself worrying about the Watch running out of juice and never had to use the power reserve mode (which turns the Watch into a timepiece only) to make it through the day. Do I wish that the thing could last for days or weeks without a charge? Of course I do, but state of the art for smartwatch battery life is no more than a day -- maybe two -- and the Watch is in line with that despite packing a 205mAh battery just two-thirds the size of most of its competitors.		The competition				Mostly, the Watch's competition comes from a plethora of Android Wear devices. When comparing software, the Watch does most everything that Wear does and more. Sure, Google Now 's contextual suggestions and voice recognition give it an edge over Siri, but the Watch's customizable faces, with their nifty complications, are far more useful. Plus, Dick Tracy fans are sure to love the Apple timepiece's abilities as a phone.		Yes, Samsung's Gear S also makes calls, and matches the Watch Sport's $350 price, but it's huge, ugly and lacks app support due to its devotion to Tizen. The Moto 360 ($180) and LG G Watch R ($249) appeal to the circular-watch crowd, but both are masculine in appearance and are too chunky for those with feminine or dainty wrists. ASUS' ZenWatch is only $200 and comes closest to the Apple Watch in terms of attractive design, but its massive screen bezel takes away from an otherwise handsome stainless steel body.		Really, if you're smartwatch shopping, it boils down to the age-old question about the phone in your pocket: iOS or Android? Because if you want a Watch, you better be comfy as a resident in Apple's walled garden.		Wrap-up				I don't think the Watch is for me. While I appreciate the thoughtfulness, quality and ingenuity of the hardware design, it's just not my style. Also, getting a Watch means locking one's self into an iPhone universe, and while it's an excellent handset, I harbor an affinity for Android phones. Plus, I rely heavily upon Google calendar and Gmail web apps both for work and personal purposes. Because of that, I can't take full advantage of the Watch's capabilities without switching to Apple's calendar and email client. And that's not happening.		However, there are plenty of folks picking up what Apple's putting down, as evidenced by the estimated million Watch pre-orders Apple received. It's a well-rounded wearable that handles notifications as well as any other smartwatch, has comprehensive activity tracking skills and the cachet of being the hottest device on the planet (for now). If you're firmly on team iPhone, are willing to pay a premium for an intelligent timepiece and can handle charging it on a nightly basis, the Watch is for you.		The bottom line is: The Watch is the nicest smartwatch available, but it's more status symbol than wearable revolutionary. Most of the Watch's features can be categorized as nice to have (at best) or superfluous (at worst), and because of that, if you're not enamored with the Watch's appearance, it's probably not compelling enough to buy one.

Fitbit Surge review: a top-notch tracker with a flawed design		Confession time: I'm a bit of a wannabe when it comes to self-quantification. The idea of counting every step I take, every calorie I eat, every day I don't have a cigarette and every minute I lie in bed restlessly tossing and turning sounds great. I want to be able to look at my life as a series of easy-to-understand numbers that I can act upon to improve myself. And every time I review a new wearable or fitness tracker I think, "This'll be the one to make it stick." The latest in the long line of would-be life-changers is the $250 Fitbit Surge. The combination of GPS running watch, step counter and sleep tracker appeals not only to the number nerd in me, but also to the semi-serious runner as well. It also appeals to the "someone trying to cut down on the clutter in their life" part of me. Why do I need a separate pedometer, GPS running watch and a regular watch? But the big question is: Can the Surge lock me into not just an ecosystem, but also a system of life-tracking and life-changing habits?		GALLERY|36 PHOTOS	Fitbit Surge review						+ See all 36	78	Fitbit	Surge		PROS		GPS and heart rate monitoring are welcome additions	Fitbit finally solved its sleep-tracking problem	Food database is robust and easy to use	CONS		Design is better suited for the gym than the office	Slightly bulky body and strap	Pricey for an activity tracker, even one with GPS	SUMMARY	The Surge solves some of Fitbit's problems with better food and sleep tracking, while adding GPS and heart rate monitoring to the mix. But its bulky, utilitarian design and high price will limit its appeal.	Hardware				So, spoiler: I'm not wearing the Surge anymore.		We'll get to the reasons why shortly, but first let's talk about what the Surge does well. The one feature that immediately jumps off the page at you is built-in GPS. Yes, the Surge marks Fitbit's first foray into serious running watch territory. It's not the fastest or most accurate GPS in the world, but it gets the job done most of the time. It reliably takes about 60 seconds to lock on to a signal (all of our tests took between 58 and 63 seconds), and spits out a reasonably accurate map of your run. It did lose signal once and the resulting map showed me careening wildly around my neighborhood. But I've also experienced this problem when using RunKeeper on both Android and iOS; it's annoying, but not unheard of. And it's certainly less infuriating than the time the Microsoft Band left me running in place for 15 minutes while it repeatedly failed to get a GPS lock.		The Surge marks Fitbit's first foray into serious running watch territory.	Like many other fitness trackers starting to hit shelves, the Surge has a heart rate monitor built in. Don't expect medical-grade heart monitoring, but it will give you a pretty accurate average heart rate for your run. Partially thanks to this new sensor, the Surge is dramatically better at sleep tracking than past Fitbits. As long as you don't have sleep tracking set to sensitive, that is. For the first week or so I was wearing the Surge, it seemed as if Fitbit couldn't do simple math. The app would say I slept from roughly midnight to 7AM, but only managed to get two and a half hours of sleep. On the plus side, Fitbit can now automatically detect when you're sleeping.				Obviously, the Surge also counts steps. That's the whole idea of a Fitbit, really. They're connected pedometers above all else. And like its stablemates the Charge and Charge HR, it does a perfectly admirable job of keeping tabs on just how much you're moving throughout the day. The new material isn't any less likely cause rashes if you never take it off, but it is extremely soft and comfortable. In fact, it feels less like plastic and more like a hi-tech fabric used in expensive athletic clothes.		You're not going to mistake it for your trusty Timex Weekender.	Unfortunately, it's also a bit bulky. It's not as cumbersome as many smartwatches on the market, but you're also not going to mistake it for your trusty Timex Weekender. It will occasionally get in the way and it won't fit neatly under the cuff of a long-sleeved shirt. The wide band and distinctly athletic design also mean it looks quite conspicuous. More than once while out and about, friends gave me quizzical looks and asked, "What is that?" That's because when you go out wearing the Surge, you look like you're always getting ready to go for a run. And that's a problem. Activity tracking is only really useful if you're doing it all the time. If you don't want to wear it while you're not exercising, it kind of defeats the purpose.				To make matters worse, it's not really a great watch. The touchscreen is far too sensitive and is rarely actually showing the time when you look at it. More often than not, you'll find you've somehow navigated to the number of flights of stairs you've climbed. Thankfully it takes several button presses to fire up the GPS; otherwise I'm pretty sure you'd start tracking a run in your sleep. And then there's the battery. Best-case scenario: You're getting a week on a charge. So much as look at the GPS, though, and that will dip to about five days. If you're wearing it to train for a marathon? Expect something closer to two.		Software				The Fitbit app is light-years beyond where it was back in 2013 when I first strapped one of the company's devices on. Visually, it's brighter, more coherent and generally just looks like a modern smartphone app. But more importantly, the calorie-counting portion of the app is finally good enough to run with the big boys. Where in the past it didn't take much to stump its food database (really, you've never heard of Goya?), now Fitbit is overflowing with results and nutritional data. And finding that information is easier than ever thanks to the addition of a barcode scanner (finally!).		The calorie-counting portion of the app is finally good enough to run with the big boys.	The other big advance is that Fitbit can finally automatically detect when you're asleep. That means no more remembering to press a button to tell the wearable it's bedtime. And, as mentioned before, if you don't turn on "sensitive" mode the sleep tracking is actually pretty accurate. From there you can dig through the collected data and start looking for those disturbing trends, like the fact that I average about four and a half hours of sleep a night during the week and that it takes me almost an hour to really settle into a restful sleep.		GALLERY|10 PHOTOS	Fitbit Surge software						+ See all 10	Fitbit still isn't the most intuitive or polished app on the market. I certainly wouldn't suggest handing it to your grandfather without an extensive tutorial. But it shouldn't give you a migraine if you're patient. Tracking exercise is at least a more visually appealing experience than in the past, and the addition of GPS maps makes it feel like a fuller solution for the more athletic out there. Plus, if you're not super into Fitbit's built-in tools, you can always connect it to other services like MyFitnessPal, RunKeeper or even use If to turn your sleep patterns into boring-ass spreadsheets with Google Drive.		One area that Fitbit seems to have ignored, however, is notifications. Specifically, the ability to push text messages and caller-ID info to the Surge. There's a pretty significant delay between when a message comes in and when it shows up on your wrist. Plus it's not entirely clear how you dismiss notifications, and they're completely passive; you can't reply without taking out your phone.		The competition				So here's the weird thing: Since the Surge adds GPS, it means that Fitbit's competitors aren't just Nike and Jawbone anymore, but also Garmin, TomTom and Microsoft. Actually, in terms of features, the Surge's closest relative is the Microsoft Band. Sure, you can't get Twitter notifications or dictate responses to Cortana, but it does a heck of a lot more than just count your steps. Like Microsoft's wearable experiment, the Surge is supposed to go with you throughout the day. It's supposed to count every step from your door to the bus stop. You're supposed to tell it when you're doing calisthenics or going for a run. And when you turn in at night, it's supposed to measure just how much shut-eye you're getting. Of course, the Surge is far more comfortable than the Band, and its battery lasts much longer.		If you just want to track how much you're moving around during the day, the Charge HR is a cheaper and sleeker solution. Fitbit's mid-range device keeps the heart rate monitor and can tell time, but it doesn't draw as much attention. And, perhaps most importantly, it only costs $150, that's a full $100 less than the Surge. If you want to go even simpler, there are devices like the $50 Misfit Flash that count steps, but pretty much stay out of the way otherwise.				On the other hand, if you're looking for a serious running watch complete with GPS and heart rate monitoring, there's a pile of options from companies like Garmin. The Vivoactive, for example, has most of the same basic features as the Surge at the same price point, with better battery life and more athlete-friendly data logging. While the Forerunner series, like the surprisingly affordable Forerunner 15 (pictured above), delivers best-in-class GPS tracking and detailed tools for runners. (Oh, it also doubles as an activity tracker during your down time.)		Wrap-up				Here's the thing about the Surge: I kind of ended up liking it. It does a ton of different things, some of them quite well. It's a serviceable running watch, a good activity tracker and a surprisingly robust sleep monitor. The problem is: I just don't want to wear it. When I'm out for a run, its mild bulk and severe black design are a non-issue. When I'm trying to sleep or going to the office, it's a different story. The Surge lacks the subtlety of its relatives like the Flex and the fashion-minded detailing of something like the Jawbone Up. Which means it's really best suited as a running watch rather than an all-day activity tracker.		However, at $250, there are more robust options for runners out there. Timex, Polar, Garmin and TomTom all make devices that more carefully cater to athletes. These running watches have fast, highly accurate GPS radios and connect to chest straps that offer far better heart rate monitoring than a wrist-worn LED. They also have advanced features for tracking progress toward goals, running intervals and coaching you through training programs.		Now, that doesn't mean the Surge doesn't have a niche. There is a market out there for activity trackers that double as GPS watches (and not the other way around). If you're a casual, fair-weather runner, a dedicated running watch might be overkill. And if you're willing to sacrifice some style and comfort in the name of best-in-class step counting and sleep tracking, then the Surge's shortcomings aren't dealbreakers. It's certainly not for everyone, but if you were intrigued by Microsoft's Band only to be turned off by its poor ergonomic design, then the Surge is worth considering.

Garmin Vivofit review: a truly fitness-focused activity tracker	blogger-avatarby James Trew | @itstrew | March 13th 2014 at 11:00 am	 61		Keep moving. That's the message you'll get from anyone offering up fitness advice these days. It's snappy, simple and probably quite valid. The problem is that it can be hard to quantify how much activity is merely part of our basic existential requirements before we get to the part that counts as extra, life-enhancing exercise. As always, technology to the rescue. On this occasion, it's an activity tracker from a company with heritage in this space: Garmin. The product? The Vivofit fitness tracker.		77	Garmin	Vivofit		PROS		Long battery life	Accurate, detailed tracking	Waterproof	CONS		Wristband is plain, a little uncomfortable	Display has no backlight	Other devices offer more features for a similar price	SUMMARY	The Vivofit may not have the cool factor of Nike's FuelBand, or some of the features found in the Fitbit Flex or Jawbone Up24, but what it does offer is reliable tracking, useful reports and a durable design. The fantastic battery life, as well as the ability to change the straps, also go a long way to making this a wearable worth considering. 	There's been a deluge of similar products lately, each bringing their own take. This is clearly a hot market right now, and the race is on to crack it. Can Garmin use its wealth of experience in wrist-worn fitness devices to set the standard? Priced at $130 or $170 with a heart rate monitor, it's up against the likes of Fitbit and Nike's FuelBand. Does it keep up with the competition? Or is it left huffing and puffing a few paces behind? We let it judge monitor our movements and coax us off the sofa to find out. Warning: This review may (definitely does) contain mental images of desk-dancing that some readers may find distressing.		GALLERY|27 PHOTOS	Garmin vívofit review						+ See all 27	Hardware			The Vivofit is comprised of two parts: the strap and the actual tracker. The strap is a cheap-feeling, plastic affair -- similar to the sort of watch you might buy at a novelty store. It's clearly durable, and will withstand all the stress and tension that exercise might demand. But, it's also a little bit uncomfortable to wear, and not the most imaginative of designs. The plastic reminds us of the kind used on cheap '80s sports watches, and can cause mild itchiness if moisture is captured underneath (say, after a shower). The strap fastens via a basic notch-and-clasp mechanism, and overall looks quite masculine -- at least on the black model, anyway.		The good news? Given that the strap is separate from the brains of the operation -- the tracker part -- you'll theoretically be able to replace it with something more comfortable. Garmin is at least offering a choice of different hues at launch, if you want something other than black. Also, unlike other bands, the strap is flexible, so it won't hang loose on your wrist, or interfere with typing. The Vivofit comes bundled with two straps, but these are just for different size options (one large, one small), not style choice.		The main event, of course, is the tracker. Unsheathed, the curved unit is about two inches long, by half an inch wide, and dominated along the topside by the screen, which measures 1 x 0.39 inch. That display is an always-on, two-color (gold and red) LCD that, again, resembles a basic digital watch face. While it's permanently on (there's no button to wake it), there's also no backlight. In fact, there's no illumination option at all.				The unit has four small screws around the edges, and they're not just there to hold things together. The Vivofit has no physical ports -- no USB; no nothing. Instead, it uses removable batteries (2 x CR1632) for power, and wireless radios (ANT+ and Bluetooth 4.0) for connectivity. This means no charging. Ever. Garmin claims you should be able to get a year's worth of use before you need to change the batteries (something we won't be able to confirm for a while), so you've plenty of time to buy the required mini screwdriver for when that moment eventually comes.		Another good thing about this screwed-down configuration is that the Vivofit is waterproof to 50 meters -- good news for swimmers. If you've gotten this far and are wondering why we haven't mentioned GPS (it is a Garmin, after all), that's because the Vivofit doesn't have it. It might seem like a weird omission, but it's likely to help battery life (and also keep the price down).		Right now, at least there's a thin line between fitness trackers and full-on sports watches. Some companies are starting to blur that distinction with products that incorporate both, but for now, the Vivofit is aimed mostly at the lifestyle fitness market, rather than someone with more demanding training requirements. As we mentioned in the intro, there are two skus as of this writing -- the standalone Vivofit, or a bundle that includes a heart rate monitor strap. It's the latter offering that we're discussing today, but since the Vivofit works with any ANT+ strap, you're good to go if you already own one. Finally, it's worth noting that both models come with an ANT+ USB adaptor for connecting/syncing the Vivofit to your computer.		Software				Garmin's online exercise-logging platform -- Connect -- has been around some time now. But it's just undergone a drastic redesign, and Vivofit users get first dibs on experiencing the new layout. There's also a matching Connect mobile app for iOS and Android that translates the new design neatly over to your phone. Both are comparable in functionality, with no significant differences (other than screen layout for the most part) so we'll refer to them interchangeably from here on out.		Setting up the Vivofit through Connect is easy. You'll need an account if you don't have one already, where you'll be required to answer the typical questions about age, weight, height, et cetera. You'll then, of course, be asked to pair your device. You can pair via Bluetooth with your phone, or with the supplied ANT+ USB dongle and your PC. The same goes for syncing, which is just a matter of pressing and holding the button on the Vivofit until the word "sync" appears (more on this later). If you're within range of your PC or phone, the Vivofit will go right ahead and upload your latest activity. The dashboard presents the most recent info from each main category, which includes Steps, Sleep, Connections (friends) and Activities. There's also the option to add more cards to the dashboard showing off your badges (achievements) and reports.				While you can theoretically use the Vivofit standalone, and never once log in to Connect (if you're just happy to aim for your step-target on a day-to-day basis), the usefulness of the wristband is undoubtedly augmented thanks to the platform. Being able to store your data in one place and easily visualize it is an essential feature for any fitness log, but an added bonus here is that you can also import activities from other devices, like a GPS watch. Yours truly, for example, has been using Garmin Connect to log runs with a Forerunner watch. Now, not only are my mapped runs there, but my general daily activities and sleep data are too, all in one place -- no more hopping from platform to platform. The ability to bring data in from third-party devices means you aren't even beholden to using a Garmin watch -- though you'll probably need to use the Vivofit for logging your steps and sleep at this time, as activity tracking isn't quite as ubiquitous yet (the ability to export this data from native apps is rare, even though Garmin lets you export Vivofit activities as GPX or TCX files).		Of course, there are a ton of reports you can dive into with Connect, too. This might not be so pertinent to general activity loggers, but if you're a card-carrying self-quantifier, then you'll love being able to know that your average heart rate over the last year (when logging, not in general!) was 141, like mine, and other such self-centered trivia.		In use				If you just wear the Vivofit and do nothing else, at best you have a watch (it tells the time wonderfully) that lets you know how much or how little you've moved that day. Effectively, you've bought awareness. The Vivofit actually has much more to offer, though, and can be a powerful little tool if you actively make use of it. This is generally true of most other fitness trackers, of course, but the Vivofit has a few additional characteristics that make it stand out.		The unit has seven screens of information you can cycle through, and then leave on the display at any time. You can also choose to remove some of them via Connect (if you don't care to know the date, for instance). Repeatedly pushing the button will loop you through them in this order: steps (daily total), goal (steps remaining), distance covered (in miles or kilometers), calories burned, time, date and heart rate. The first two are effectively the opposite of each other; the steps counter starts at zero and works up, while your daily goal starts high and counts down. When and if you achieve your goal, this number starts counting back up again to show how many extra steps you achieved. Both of these screens are handy for keeping tabs on how you're doing at different parts of the day -- or you may just be more motivated by increasing your steps, or crushing your target, for example.		Just as useful, perhaps, but for different reasons, are the distance-covered and calories-burned metrics. The former is just that -- the total amount of miles (or kilometers) you've plodded through that day. As this is total daily movement, and not just your exercise sessions, it can be quite revealing to see how much this can vary from day to day. Likewise, the calories-burned screen shows the total number you've burned throughout the day. Not just from your walking/exercise, but the total number of calories required for you to be on planet Earth that day, whatever you were doing. This is worked out based on your physical details (e.g., height, age, gender), along with the movement data, making it one of the more accurate numbers for representing your daily metabolic burn. Of course, we're all different, and there are other factors (that metabolism-jacking double espresso you nuked after lunch), but all told, it's a useful number to know, and it's right there on your wrist.				We said you actually needed to use the Vivofit, and so far we've merely acquainted you with the information it offers. To add a bit more activity to your daily routine, the obvious thing to do is start smashing through those footsteps, and heading toward your daily goal. Easy enough in theory, with a stroll at lunch, the walk back from the bus stop and so on. The Vivofit has another trick too, though, which is reminding you that you've been on your "mattress" (read: sedentary) for too long. Other trackers do this too -- Jawbone's Up will vibrate, and the FuelBand lets you "win" the hour -- but we particularly like Garmin's approach. Instead of just giving you a nudge, then forgetting about it, the Vivofit displays an ominous red bar on the screen, which stays there until you've moved enough to clear it. This happens after around an hour of inactivity, and extra sections are added to the bar for each of the following 15 minutes that you remain motionless, for a total of two hours.		Call us optimists, but we enjoyed the challenge of working off this "Move bar" (this is where the desk-dancing comes in) every time we saw it; the fact that it remains on display until you do makes this a more practical and less invasive way to do it (a vibration on your wrist as you type an email can be annoying). With the Move bar visible, then, you can be mindful that you ought to get up, but won't be annoyed by it should you be in a situation where desk-dancing (or, you know, walking, whatever) isn't an option. With the Jawbone Up, we ultimately turned this feature off, as the vibrating alert usually happened when we were predisposed. Worse, we would then forget to make up the activity once we were at a dance-friendly location (this should be all locations, we know).				So we've gotten up and out of our chairs. That's a good start, but the second way to actually benefit from the Vivofit is to use the calorie guidance. The number provides you with a solid target to aim for with your daily food intake. In theory (and mostly theory), you could plan your meals to come in 500 calories below this number, and lose a pound of fat a week (going by the 3,500 calories in a pound of fat "wisdom"). Alternatively, you can use this as another number to actively increment, via steps or activity, to hit a chosen goal. So, if you noticed there were 600 calories in that "low fat" snack, time to get running and count them off one by one from the wrist. Of course, it's a little oversimplified to put it like that, but you get the idea. In short, what we enjoyed most about the Vivofit was the instant access to this information (and the Move bar) without the need for updating an app, or even touching a button in some cases (depending on which screen you leave the Vivofit showing). You may have your own goals: better/more sleep, general motivation, wellness and so on, but the value in this is so much clearer when you decide to use the data, or follow its advice (mostly: move!).		Another strong point with the Vivofit is the accuracy of the distance tracking. We took it out for a couple of long walks, which we measured with different GPS watches (one Garmin, one Adidas) and on every occasion the Vivofit was surprisingly close to the mark. Between 0.1 and 0.05 mile or so off. That's not bad, and given that this works indoors, and all day, that means your activity data should be consistent and pretty reliable. Garmin works this out based on your personal details, and projected stride length. It also detects when you're running, and factors in the difference that will make on stride length, too. While the Vivofit will log your distance all day long, you can also easily log something as an "activity too" (e.g., a training session) if you have a heart rate monitor. When you put the strap on and navigate to the "heart" screen, the Vivofit will listen out for the HRM signal, and once it gets it, the unit will not only display it (with BPM and heart rate intensity "zone"), it'll also mark this as the start of a training activity. This worked great in our tests, and makes for a seamless experience. The next time you sync, you'll see your activity logged on Connect with all the related statistics -- pace, calories burned, average heart rate, et cetera.				The last, and potentially most helpful, feature is how the Vivofit automatically adapts to your training goals. Most activity trackers start out with a fixed goal -- usually around 10,000 steps -- or let you set your own manually, and there it ends. If you meet your goal, great; if not, oh well. The Vivofit starts you off with a modest 5,000-step goal, and adjusts every day from there depending on whether you achieve it or not. I fell short on my first day (go easy on me; I set it up in the afternoon), and the next day's goal was about 4,800 steps. I crushed this, of course, and was given the challenge of around 5,200 steps the following day. The amount added/subtracted from your goal isn't fixed either. After a particularly active day, the goal goes up by more than after one where you only just met your target. Obviously you could keep going up and up and up (or down and down), but the idea that you can constantly be challenged to eke out a few more steps adds an extra dimension to an otherwise simple training premise.				If there are any wrinkles in the experience, they boil down to rudimentary technical issues. While it's nice to have a choice of sync options, we found both ANT+ and Bluetooth a bit unreliable. Sometimes we'd have to close the app and reopen it for the update to go through, or restart the Garmin ANT agent software on our desktop. It'd always sync, but sometimes it needed a little encouraging. The second functional negative is the lack of a backlight on the screen. For the most part, this isn't an issue, but it can be at times -- namely, when you're going to bed. To activate sleep mode, you have to press and hold the button for around five seconds. This is the same process as accessing sync mode and pair mode, with just the duration of the press determining which option you choose. Sleep mode is the second in this list, so when you press the button, you have to wait for sync to come, then go, before releasing the button. If you're in the dark, there's no way of telling when this happens (other than counting the seconds, and hoping for the best). At a more basic level, the same issue makes the Vivofit less useful as a watch at night!		It's probably also worth mentioning a few things the Vivofit doesn't do. Most surprising -- given the emphasis on activity and training -- is the lack of a stopwatch, or a manual way to kick off activities without a heart rate strap. Being able to time a running interval or trigger a lap point seems like something that might slot in quite naturally with how the Vivofit is currently set up. There are also no other smartwatch-style features. To be fair, Garmin never claimed there would be, but given the always-on screen, wrist placement and Bluetooth 4.0 connectivity to your phone, some might argue there was a chance to fold in some notifications, app-to-Vivofit alerts or even smart motivation alerts. Ultimately, Garmin has clearly decided to focus on the core functionality of fitness tracking, and not weigh it down with superfluous features, but the always-on screen is ripe for exploiting, we think.		The competition				The Vivofit isn't short of competition. We've already mentioned Nike's FuelBand ($149), Jawbone's Up24 ($150) and Fitbit (which makes more than one worthy competitor). All three of those have their own plus points. Jawbone's software is comprehensive and easy to use. Nike's FuelBand has the brand cachet and great social features (though it's also iOS only), and the Fitbit Force is as complete as any other tracker we've seen. That was, until it got recalled after irritating some users' skin. Something of a shame, as pound for pound (or dollar for dollar), this was likely one of the Vivofit nearest rivals.		There are a host of others to consider, too. The oft-overlooked Polar Loop ($110) came out before, and costs less than the Vivofit and has a very similar feature set (the two brands are old foes in the sports watch world, after all). Or, if you want something with a gentler aesthetic, there's also the Misfit Shine ($120). Don't be fooled by its simple design -- it's as versatile, if not more so than its rivals, as it's not restricted to being worn on the wrist. We must note, though, that the accompanying Android app isn't as comprehensive as the iOS version. All told, there's plenty to consider, as we said, and even more in the pipeline.		Wrap-up				More Info	Garmin Vivofit hands-on	Garmin announces Vivofit	Switched On: The next steps for digital wellness	There are a lot of good things going on here. For once, we have an activity tracker that permanently shows your steps/time/goal, with little to no user interaction required. We like the implementation of the Move bar, and how the daily goal adapts to the individual user. Likewise, the accuracy of the distance tracking and the ability to log training sessions (with added heart rate data) make this a great choice for moderate trainers, gym bunnies (finally a way to log those treadmill sessions effortlessly) and those who wish to keep general tabs on their daily activity levels. And, of course, let's not forget the epic battery life and waterproofing, a combo that means you can put this on and almost never have to think about it again.		Except that you will. We're less sold on the strap, which is serviceable, but not as sleek or comfortable as we'd like. Also, the lack of a backlight (or low-light visibility) is a minor annoyance. Lastly, the $130 price might not make it the most expensive tracker on the market, but from a company like Garmin, we'd like to have seen a few more detailed features such as elevation/stair tracking, food logging, a stopwatch/timer or even just some extended watch features (e.g., an alarm, timer.). If you're looking for a reliable, durable activity tracker that has a decent online platform, the Vivofit is all of those things. If you can live with its minor flaws, and don't mind the aesthetic, it's a worthy addition to your fitness arsenal.		Daniel Orren and Edgar Alvarez contributed to this review.

The TomTom Runner is a GPS sports watch for runners who want to track their performance outdoors and on the treadmill in the gym. All the running data can be uploaded to the TomTom MySports website and a host of running websites.	TomTom previously collaborated with Nike on the Nike SportWatch. Like Asus and the Google Nexus 7, Nike got all the love despite the fact that TomTom actually made the watch. This time TomTom is going it alone.		TomTom Runner – Design	If you’ve seen the Nike SportWatch, the Runner shares many of the same design characteristics. There’s a big, visible display and the same easy to use menu system. The display has shaved off some of the screen size from the top and bottom, making it closer in size to a sports watch like the Garmin Forerunner 10.	The TomTom Runner is available in grey and pink, and comes in two parts. There’s the watch module, made up of a scratch resistant LCD display, and a ‘One Touch control’ that surrounds the GPS receiver. The ‘One Touch control’ is not really an accurate description. It’s actually a four-button control pad. Alongside the display you’ll find a row of three dots that when pressed activate a backlight that’s bright enough to illuminate the display for a late evening run.		The display and control pad can be taken out of the rubber watch strap to charge inside the dedicated charging dock. Yes, the built-in USB feature is gone, which is a major disappointment. There’s also a selection of different coloured watch straps available if you really feel the need to customize.		image: http://static.trustedreviews.com/94/000028655/2305_orh616w616/TomTom-Runner-1.jpg				The rubber, perforated watch strap is slim and extremely light. The small rows of dimples on the inside of the strap mean the TomTom Runner does not sit right against the skin, which makes it more comfortable to wear and prevents it from feeling too sticky when you take it off.		Weighing in at 50g, the Runner is lighter than the Nike Sportswatch (63g) but still heavier than the Garmin Forerunner 10 (42g). At 11.5mm thick, it’s far less clunky than most sports watches, making it ideal to wear as an everyday watch. Like the Forerunner 10, the TomTom Runner is weather- and waterproof up to 50m. We can confirm that it can survive a morning shower and a few laps in the swimming pool.		The watch is secure in the strap when out running, but it’s a different situation when you take it off. The watch part sits quite loose inside the strap and can easily fall out. If you plan to throw this into your bag, be prepared to have a rummage around for the watch part when it comes to your next run.	TomTom Runner – Features	The TomTom Runner has a built-in accelerometer and sensors to work both outdoors and on a treadmill offering the kind of data you’d expect to find on most sports watches. You can view distance, pace, average pace, stride length, calories burned and lap times all in real-time. Bluetooth Smart support lets you sync the TomTom Runner with additional devices, including a heart rate strap if you want to train in specific running zones.	There’s also regular watch features, including 24-hour format display and an alarm option if you need a nudge to get up for that early morning run. Like the Nike Sportswatch, there’s vibration alerts if you run with music to prompt you on your progress.	image: http://static.trustedreviews.com/94/000028656/b60a_orh616w616/TomTom-Runner-2.jpg				The new graphical training partner is all about pushing you to work harder in your running sessions, whether it’s competing against your last run or setting a precise goal for a running session. When you race against yourself, the training partner will display the current run and previous run on the screen. If you’ve set a goal to run 10km, the Runner will display progress in a percentage.	One of the most important features is the QuickGPSFix technology. Many sports watches, including the Nike Sportswatch, are plagued with GPS signal issues. TomTom incorporates technology it uses for its satnavs to improve the time it takes to receive a GPS signal. The decision to separate the GPS receiver from the watch display is clearly a move to improve getting a connection.	Once you’ve been for a run, you can sync and share the data through the TomTom MySports web tool. Powered by MapMyFitness, the web tool lets you uploading data and includes support to upload data to MapMyRun and Runkeeper. You can also export data in a series of file formats including FIT if you want to keep it as part of a training plan.
CNET Tech Culture Putting Nike's FuelBand (and me) through the paces	Putting Nike's FuelBand (and me) through the paces	An early impression of Nike's activity-monitoring wristband, where I unexpectedly jump rope, drum on buckets, and do a few surprisingly intense basketball drills--all to test out the device.	by Roger Cheng 	 @RogerWCheng January 20, 2012 4:00 AM PST	facebook	twitter	linkedin	googleplus	email	comments	 		Nike's FuelBand activity monitor.	Nike	I have to hand it to Nike for its unique take on the growing fad of fitness-tracking devices.		The FuelBand is Nike's stab at this segment, which others including the Jawbone Up and Motorola Mobility's MotoActv have already tread. But with production of the Up halted for a battery issue , and Motorola's product still a little-known niche device, there's a big opening in the market.		Unlike some of the other devices, the primary crux of the FuelBand is its Nike Fuel reading, a metric that Nike put together on its own that matches a person's movement through the wristband's accelerometer against data collected on how rapidly oxygen is consumed. As with other fitness monitors that rely on an accelerometer, the readings vary greatly depending on how much you move your arm. Cycling and certain kinds of weight lifting, for instance, wouldn't register much as simply sitting on your couch and waving your hands.		But chances are, if you're spending $149 on a FuelBand, you're going to want to pay attention to the Nike Fuel readout.		Following a press conference that Nike held yesterday to unveil the device , the company took the media on a little field trip to test out the FuelBand in a variety of activities. The following are my early impressions after a day with the device.		My initial thought when I put on the device was how rigid it was. It's also a little bulky--at least bulkier than the Jawbone Up, but less intrusive than a MotoActv held on by a wristband. There was actually little give on the device, and I was concerned that it would start to chaff or knock against my bone. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the device seemingly fades away when you're in the middle of your activity, quietly working in the background.		After slapping it on and syncing it to the provided iPod Touch via Bluetooth, I was on my way. Coming right out of the box, my Nike Fuel score was a measly 37. That would change soon.			First up on the activity list, double-dutch jump rope.	Roger Cheng/CNET	The Nike representatives were coy about the afternoon "experience segment" as the media piled into a small shuttle bus. The first stop: a "very Brooklyn" abandoned warehouse retrofitted into a gallery space, where members of the National Double Dutch League first demonstrated the art of skipping between two ropes, and then dragging journalists and Nike representatives into the action.		After a timid first step, I was skipping rope and getting in touch with my inner child. I also learned I wasn't particularly good at either holding or skipping rope. After a few turns skipping and holding the rope, I checked my wristband, but barely made any progress with my FuelBand.			Reporters and Nike representatives alike got in on the fun.	Roger Cheng/CNET	Next up: bucket drumming. Members of the band the Drumadics got us banging on old buckets with drumsticks, slowly forming a cohesive, if not all too great sounding, collective of drummers.		I learned a few things while drumming: it's actually a pretty intense workout if you keep at it, and I have no rhythm at all. It's the same reason I stink at the drums in Rock Band.		After the two activities, I clocked in at a reasonable 575, still a bit short of the 750 goal Nike had set for all of the FuelBands.			Bucket drummers from the band Drumadics led reporters in a round of rhythmic beating.	Roger Cheng/CNET	Turns out those activities were just the appetizers to the main course: a stop at the Masaryk Basketball Court in the Lower East Side of Manhattan.			One out-of-shape CNET reporter attempting a shot.	Nike	Nike arranged to have everyone outfitted with basketball gear (all Nike branded, of course) and on the court. A number of basketball vets and professional players ran us through a beginner's version of one of their camps, getting us moving through running, layup, and shooting drills.		I don't consider myself a terrible basketball player, but not a particularly good one either. Having not played ball for a while, it also felt good to be on the court--particularly one that Nike has clearly put some money into renovating. One thing I certainly am is out of shape. The drills admittedly left me pretty winded, although the fear of embarrassing myself was a pretty strong motivator.		After the drills, I noticed my total jumped to above 1,800. Likewise, most of the reporters had scores that rocketed up after the intense session. For comparison's sake, a total normal day's activity should be around 2,500 points, with an active day at 4,000, and a high-energy day at 5,500. By syncing it to the iPod Touch through a complimentary FuelBand app, I was able to get my activity in graph form and set a new daily goals.		In total, the group of reporters scored nearly 22,000 Nike Fuel points.		At this point, you're probably tired of me referring to Nike Fuel, which is where the dilemma for the FuelBand lies.		The decision to move to their own standard of measuring activity was a bold one, and comes with some decent advantages. Athletes from different sports can compare their activities on an apples to apples basis. It promotes activity of any kind, something the government and health organizations have been shouting as us to do more of. For the gamer in me, the app gives you a score that you psychologically want to keep beating (there are even achievements packed into the app when you clear different benchmarks--I got an ice-themed one for doubling my daily goal--as well as a little mascot named Fuelie that cheers you on). Nike was smart to use this system as a minor dangling carrot to keep users motivated.		But the Nike Fuel system is by nature too exclusive. If you don't own a Nike product, you won't know or care about Nike Fuel. The company is hoping to push Nike Fuel into the social media realm, allowing you to share scores online or check in via apps like FourSquare. Again, even if you were comfortable sharing a score, would you? It's unclear since few people would really appreciate it. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't.		Related stories		Nike unveils its FuelBand activity-tracking device  li>	Jawbone Up aims to get you healthier	Jawbone halts UP production over battery issue, offers full refunds	Motorola MotoActv GPS tracking device	Yes, the FuelBand also displays steps and calories, but that's almost an afterthought next to Nike Fuel. Nike seems pretty confident in this new metric, and a representative said all of its other Nike+ devices will eventually provide Fuel readouts as well.		When it launches next month, it'll only work with iOS devices initially, with Android coming in a few months. While I'm certain they will be smoothed out, I found I had trouble synching my wristband to the provided iPod Touch a few times, requiring me to restart to band. The app launches in the iTunes store on February 22, the same day the FuelBand is available in the U.S.		Nike's device also only really focuses on activity, whereas the Jawbone Up looked at a person's holistic schedule, including features that help monitor sleep and eating patterns. The Up even vibrates gently to wake you up or to provider reminders. The Up, however, doesn't have a display, and of course has its battery issues, and can't sync to other devices through Bluetooth. Nike says the FuelBand should last four days on a full charge.		Like the Up, the FuelBand goes for simplicity, with only one button to switch between the time, Nike Fuel, calories, and step readout. Unfortunately, that means no stopwatch or ability to track your different laps. Nike says the FuelBand is designed to work with other Nike+ devices, although I'm not sure if athletes want to pack that much gear during their activities.		Motorola's MotoActv comes with a music player and GPS capabilities, but is at least $100 pricier.		While it's impossible to get a complete assessment of such a device in one afternoon, I have to admire the ambition and thought that was put into the FuelBand. It feels like a quality product, and could potentially be a worthy competitor to what's out in the market right now--as long as you're willing to buy into Nike's Fuel concept.

Such was the case when I started poking around the nether regions of Tiara’s new 44 Coupe. For example, some would call the support system for the bulkhead opening that allows the 44 Coupe’s huge, extra wide sliding glass salon doors “overbuilt.” I call it the appropriate to last over the long haul. It features 4-inch by 6-inch vertical fiberglass beams running up the sides of the salon and across the top of the opening, as well as a large structure beneath the cockpit sole that spans the boat’s beam. This is just a door opening.		Outboard, in the 43 Coupe’s engine compartment, I admired large, reinforcing knees that ensure that the hullsides don’t flex too much. Forward on each side, aluminum structural pillars fabricated on a heavy-duty sill along the windshield landing support the 44 Coupe’s house structure and the large windows that give such a great view when you’re cruising. Throughout the boat, the hinges for all the locker hatches have a great, heavy-duty feel. You know when you close a hatch it’s not going to pop back open, which gives me a good feeling about how the boat is built overall. Tiara laid up the boat with a solid fiberglass bottom and balsa coring in the hullsides and deck.		Out on a lumpy Lake Michigan, my opinion of the Tiara 44 Coupe only improved. It’s based on the same bottom as the 48 Convertible and the bluewater design knocked down waves with condescension and exhibited runabout-like handling when I put it through a series of turns at about 25 mph. I drove it with the steering wheel and controls and then had even more fun, taking command with the joystick. It’s nothing new, but sitting back and taking control of a 45’6” vessel in the same way my 14-year-old plays a video game still makes me giggle.		Learn About The "Adventure Yacht" Edition of this Boat		From the time the manufacturer decided to come out with a complement to the 50 Coupe, Tiara remained dedicated to ensuring that the 44 Coupe exhibit the handling traits for which the manufacturer’s boats are known. That even included moving the engine halves of the Volvo Penta IPS 600 pod drive systems farther forward and linking them to the pod drives with jack shafts. This is a practice employed by manufacturers of sportfishing boats to improve cockpit space and center the weight of the engines for enhanced stability and an easier motion, but for more of an express-cruiser style boat, this could have been risky. Moving the engines forward meant the manufacturer couldn’t expand the size of the mid-cabin, which designers usually can do when working with IPS.. I applaud them for wanting to ensure that the 44 Coupe rode and felt like previous Tiara yacht. My test boat topped off at a speedy 37.4 mph at 3600 rpm and cruised comfortably at 26.3 mph at 3000 rpm. This performance is similar to that you can expect from boats like Cruisers Yachts 45 Cantius ( $955,350, powered like our test boat) the docks, the joystick made life easy and so did the windows that ensured I could see everything while docking.		At the helm, the twin Volvo Penta Glass Cockpit screens provided all requisite information on engine health and navigation. Controls are comfortably positioned and the dash is finished in a glare killing dark upholstery. To port, there’s ample space for a crowd on the L-shaped lounge.		When you head belowdecks on the 44 Coupe, you’ll find some clever ideas that make the boat feel spacious. First is the hatch to the master stateroom that folds over twice to further open the area. There’s a queen berth with abundant small-item stowage and plenty of natural light thanks to an overhead deck hatch and side ports. The master head has a separate shower stall, impressive for a boat in this size range.		Close off the master stateroom doors and you can answer Nature’s call in the day head, which is located at the bottom of the salon stairs. Work your way aft and the mid cabin has twin berths that stretch from starboard to port and fill in with a cushion to accommodate two adults. The hanging locker in this area is actually larger than in the master, so you might be fighting with the owner of the boat for space.		Back up in the salon, the galley is aft to starboard with Isotherm refrigerator and freezer drawers and plenty of dry stowage. The cockpit has space for a crowd to hang out in open air and I liked the steps built into the engine-compartment vents that facilitate side boarding, but my favorite feature on the 44 Coupe was the optional barbecue in the transom trunk ($2,280). I can’t think of a better location for a grill than on the transom. Any spills are easy to clean up and should the flames get out of control, there’s plenty of water. After all, you’re on a boat. And the hinges and hatch for the aft trunk are, of course, overbuilt.		Comparable Model: Cruisers Yachts 45 Cantius	Tiara 44 Coupe

While some boaters moving up from the family bowrider to a pocket cruiser, sedan or express have aspirations to boat overnight, many boaters really just want a much bigger version of an open bow boat to use during the day. Hence we see the most welcome development of the day boat, like the 307 SSX 50th Anniversary Edition I tested, executed to the highest degree by Chaparral Boats.		Outfitted with twin 300 hp MerCruiser MAGs paired with Bravo Three sterndrives, our test boat sprinted to over 50 mph on a windy, choppy day. With the optional speed-scraping hardtop ($7,377), this number stood as a reminder that you can go big and still achieve impressive performance. The boat’s hull design, Chaparral’s signature extended V-plane hull that molds in afterplanes to extend the running surface past the propulsion point, helps with that. The V-plane and the steep 22-degree deadrise helped the 307 SSX nullify any bay chop we encountered.		With the 307, Chaparral strictly adheres to the day boat concept — there’s no cuddy cabin or changing room hidden under one of the consoles. (If you really want sleepover potential, it offers the 327 SSX for that purpose.) Instead you’ll find massive stowage underneath the helm console with a built-in trash receptacle. You’ll find a well-appointed head in the port console with 4 feet 3 inches of headroom, an optional vacuum-flush, pump-out head ($809) and a faux teak sole. The large port allows in plenty of sunlight, and it opens to let in ample fresh air.		The bow cockpit has fantastic seating with forward-facing recliners on the consoles with flip-up armrests. A filler cushion creates a sun lounge, and there’s a chock for the cockpit table. There’s also an insulated cooler built into the bow step. Note how the cushions open front to back on gas struts to access the storage.		The main cockpit features twin double-wide chairs with flip-up bolsters in front of the helm and the port console. An entertainment center can be installed behind the helm, and the seating array makes for a great conversation pit around the cockpit table. What a great way to spend the day on the water.

The beauty of the 360SC is the clever way space is maximized to wring the last measure of day-boat essence from its deck plan, and it’s so maneuverable that operating it will invite even the less-experienced skippers to the helm.		Sterndrive power is the key to its ease of operation. Even with standard nonjoystick steering, the 360SC pivots easily, crabs sideways for tricky side-to docking and cruises through choppy waters with comfort. Visibility proved panoramic from the helm, and the dual seat offered a great seating or standing position from which to pilot the ship.		Instrumentation was arrayed logically, trim switches were set ergonomically, and electronics space proved ample. The convertible companion seat allows passengers to converse with the skipper and adds to the versatility of the helm deck space.		The combination worked beautifully for us offshore of Boca Raton, Florida. The positive control of the drives was reassuring as we navigated the tricky Boca Raton Inlet. In seas, we tucked the drives in at 30 knots and whipped the helm left and right, enjoying its ability to hold turns, stay on plane and come out of the turns without prop slip or ventilation. We noted too the hull’s ability to cleave seas. One would think that in a vessel with so much on board, a cabinet door, a latch or a hinge might rattle, but none did. We quietly crushed the rollers.		Dockside, a swift current swept past our moorings, which were flanked with more spankin’ new Montereys, barely leaving a couple of feet of clearance on either end. This is where Axius Joystick Piloting makes timid skippers look like old salts. I easily adjusted the 360SC’s clearance between the other boats before gently nudging the dockside padding.		Test day dawned with air humid enough to form puddles around cold drinks, but at the helm we kept cool thanks to the air conditioning ($5,115). How very nice in a hot climate.		Access to the cockpit is via a transom door at the starboard side of the roughly 4-foot swim platform. Yep, there’s a shower there to wash off sand or salt, and as you walk through you can grab a cold drink from the cooler drawer in the starboard coaming. Or, with the transom seat laid flat, make like a starfish on the broad sun pad. Flip it up and aft-facing seats become ideal for catching a sunset while on the hook.		Regal’s 35 Sport Coupe ($313,740 with twin 300 hp MerCruiser 350 MAG Bravo Three DTS sterndrives) boasts a comparable transom seating area, but its flip-over seat-back design offers only front- or aft-facing seat backs, not both as does the Monterey. Regal’s sliding roof completely opens the cockpit, while better shading the aft seating area.		Another distinction of Monterey’s design leadership resides in the cockpit. Unlike the rounded, puffy seating that is so commonplace, I discovered upholstered settees with crisp, squared edges and generous padding. They’re firmly comfortable, offering a secure ride while delighting the eye and giving a firm nod to the angular seating found in European sports cars. Grab rails parrot the angular look with easy-to-grab, rectangular-section stainless steel.		The cabin below offers shattering beauty with a feeling of workmanship, luxury and utility warmly toned in wood and stone. Passages between galley and settee are generous. The galley counter is a stonelike surface with a ceramic cooktop and stainless-steel sink. A stainless-steel fridge doubles cooling capacity when combined with another in the cockpit. Overhead cabinets give secure stowage for neccessaries and easy access to the circuit panel.		An aft berth is roomy with good headroom, and the V-berth forward makes comfortable a family or two couples. Remember though that this is a day boat. The forward-positioned helm and expanded topside amenities that foster the day-boat mission result in a cabin more suited to serving those enjoying a party topside than being the boat’s focal point for entertaining. One can weekend aboard, but “berth count” cruising is not what the 360SC was built for.		That said, the woodwork is top-notch. Contrasting hardwood dog-bone inlays add accents, as do contrasting hardwood cup holders inset on hinged table corners. The design offers a smooth table for dining or a poker-style table for more casual affairs.		Thoughts of gaming aside, Monterey has also designed entertainment functionality with the sports spectator in mind. Flat-panel TVs with quality speaker systems and generous amps give plenty of viewing options and cabin- or cockpit-filling sound.		We’d be remiss if we simply focused on the comfort and convenience of operating the 360SC. It’s been ideally designed for easy maintenance too. A large hatch gives great access to engines, genset and plumbing. Small hatches within the main hatch accommodate quick checks on strainers and dipsticks. Such attention to the “back end” of boating means the front end is more enjoyable for the skipper without a paid crew. And running Monterey’s 360SC is too much fun to pawn off to a hired hand.

Center-console builders have wised up to that, building serious fishing machines with actual places to sit, tan and socialize. The new Sea Chaser 22 HFC, built by Carolina Skiff, provides just such a platform — the HFC in the name fittingly stands for Hybrid Fish and Cruise.		For cruising, the family will like the bench that runs almost the entire length of the transom, save for the area to port where the 25-gallon livewell is installed. The bench features two separate cushions over hatches. The cushion to starboard lifts to reveal an insulated built-in cooler. The larger hatch to center opens for access to the batteries, bilge and other ship systems. An added backrest extends above the transom topside to provide more passenger comfort.		Cruising passengers can rest a cold beverage in one of eight LED-lit cup holders placed throughout the boat, including two in the bow area. The bow features snap-on cushions to easily convert the boat from fishing to lounging duty. Removable backrests slide in to create twin forward-facing loungers. There’s a pedestal base for a cockpit table on the hatch opening to the insole 32-gallon fish box. There’s another 52 gallons of storage capacity under the U-shaped seating. There’s also a removable 100-quart cooler under the helm leaning post.		Fishing features? Besides the aforementioned livewell and fish box, there’s rod storage built into each gunwale, with room for three rods per side. There’s a raw-water washdown, plus four rod holders built into the topsides, four more in the leaning post and four on the T-top.		Underway, the boat climbed onto plane fairly quickly with no real squatting or loss of visibility at the helm. With the 200 hp Suzuki test power, it accelerated to 30 mph in about seven seconds on its way to a 44.7 mph top end. The top of the swim step corners dipped a little too low to the water during hard-over turns at 30 mph, causing drag and throwing spray, but otherwise the boat performed well in a light bay chop.

Max Horsepower: 300	    Available Power: Volvo Penta or MerCruiser gasoline sterndrive	    More Information: regalboats.com		1 of 22		The water was flat-calm but I was excited to jump in and catch some waves anyway, thanks to the new Regal 2100 RX Surf Edition. Once I hopped off the transom and grabbed the short tow rope, the driver of the boat pushed a few buttons on the Regal View system to adjust the wake and hit the throttle. Before I knew it, I was surfing for the first time on a man-made swell.		Wakesurfing might be the coolest new tow sport to develop in boating in the past 50 years. It’s low-impact and the basics are fairly easy to master, so kids and adults can all enjoy it. The only caveat — it’s not really a tow sport. Sure, you use a tow rope to start, but once up and in the sweet spot of the boat’s wake, you use the power generated by the wave, not the boat. To do so you have to get ridiculously close to the transom, a fact that previously made it safe to enjoy only behind V-drive and inboard boats with six-figure sticker prices. Earlier this year, Volvo Penta introduced its Forward Drive, which has a lower unit like a sterndrive but with the props facing forward — so that they pull the boat rather than push it, like Volvo’s innovative IPS system for diesel engines does. We first tested the drive in a Bryant 233X Surf Edition last fall, but behind the Regal 2100 RX, I actually got to surf the waves.		The Forward Drive tucks the props in front of the drive rather than sticking out behind, with the extended swim platform adding an extra layer of protection. With the RX package, you get upgraded upholstery and graphics plus the PowerTower — a boarding must-have that raises the tow point up and closer to the boat’s center of gravity, eliminating rider pull during elevated tow sports like wakeboarding and wakeskating. It’s tricked out with speakers and swiveling board racks, and it lowers with the push of a button for trailering or transiting under bridges.		The Surf Edition adds the Forward Drive, the Regal View helm — a touch-screen master command multifunction display — surf tabs and a ballast system. With Regal View, the driver can set the controls and adjust the surf tabs to the rider’s preferences and then set the boat so that it automatically accelerates to the desired speed and makes the boat list to either port or starboard to help sculpt the wake to the rider’s preferred side. Two 80-gallon ballast bags sit under the sun pad to either side of the transom, and a third one fills up the insole locker in the cockpit. They fill with water at the push of a button on the Regal View.		Being goofy-foot, I had the driver set the boat to the starboard side so I could face the wave, and with help from an onboard pro, I quickly got up and eased into the standing wave. I rode for about 20 minutes but could have done it for hours. With the speed set to around 11 mph, falling didn’t hurt, and with no bindings on the board I had no fear of tearing up my knees. I can attest to the addictive appeal of this sport.		That’s where Regal and other builders are hoping to cash in on the Forward Drive. Whereas most surf-specific inboard boats have prohibitive costs for casual family boarders, the new fleet of surfable bowriders should be more affordable and more versatile by design. Other boats incorporating Volvo’s Forward Drive include the Four Winns TS222, the Bryant 233X Surf Edition and the Cobalt 24SD WSS. Chaparral and Monterey are also developing models around the Forward Drive.		So you can surf behind it, but how does the Regal 2100 RX Surf Edition stack up while on plane? Pretty darn well. It’s still the same Regal FasTrac hull, which adds a step underneath to improve efficiency and ride attitude. With the 300 hp Volvo Penta engine I broke 50 mph, a few miles per hour faster than when we tested the 2100 RX with a 225 hp Volvo mated to a traditional sterndrive in 2013. I actually found the handling to be more responsive and nimble at the helm. Regal attributes that to the forward-facing drive, which keeps the props in a constant flow of water. This proved particularly true handling around the docks and in reverse. The only thing I found confusing was trimming the drive; in shallow water, trimming down actually tucks the drive farther under the boat. To get shallower in a traditional sterndrive, you’d trim up.		The 2100 RX Surf Edition is well equipped to keep the crew comfortable, starting with the aft sun pad. Its cushions can convert into aft-facing rumble seats. Each side lifts on gas struts for access to the ballast bags. Note that, even with the PowerTower, Regal still adds a tow eye to the transom to accommodate skiing and tubing. Comfortable seating wraps around the transom to a rear-facing recliner at the port console that can hold two loungers. Two passengers can lounge, or four can sit, in the bow. But the best place to be, in the case of the Regal 2100 RX Surf Edition, is in the water behind it.	Regal 2100 RX Surf Edition

Credit Beneteau’s patented Air Step hull, which draws air from topside intakes and allows it to flow out over a pair of steps. The Air Step design has a pair of “aft runners” that hold the air under the hull all the way to the transom. This air cushion reduces friction but still allows a solid flow of water to reach the propellers. Meanwhile, the keel, forward-lifting strakes and aft runners hold the GT Flyers's hull firmly on track while underway.		The GT Flyer 35 shines as a day boat with overnight capabilities. Its double helm seat provides excellent sight lines. The arch, integral to the curvaceous windshield side wings, provides protection from wind blast while allowing in the sun. Aft is a full galley, a U-shaped dinette, and a bench that converts to a sun lounge. A full-length rail makes it safe going to the forward sun pad. A huge swim platform completes the outdoor facilities.		Belowdecks, the master cabin lies athwartships beneath the helm, with a head to port opposite a hanging locker and sink. Forward, the dinette converts to a V-berth. Fit and finish are excellent, with cabinetwork a highlight.		Who’d Want One: Day boaters seeking to please a crowd.
