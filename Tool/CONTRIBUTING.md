## Contributing to MeTA

This document is for those who would like to add or improve code in MeTA.

Contributing to MeTA should be relatively straightforward. If you have a new
feature, submit a pull request on the develop branch. Developers will comment on
your pull request as means of a code review. If everything looks good, we will
merge your changes into develop. Develop will then be merged into master during
the next release of MeTA.

If you have questions, comments, or suggestions, feel free to post on the [MeTA
forum](https://forum.meta-toolkit.org/).

For more detailed instructions on pull requests, see [GitHub's
tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). Remember,
you're always making a pull request for your branch into develop.
